TheIGF2and adjacentH19are the imprinted genes of the telomeric cluster in the 11p15 chromosomal region regulated by differentially methylated regions (DMRs) or imprinting centers (ICs): H19/IGF2:IG-DMR (IC1). Dysregulation due to IC1 Loss-of-Methylation (LoM) or Gain-of-Methyaltion (GoM) causes Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) or Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) disorders associated with growth retardation or overgrowth, respectively. Specific features define each of the two syndromes, but isolated asymmetry is a common cardinal feature, which is considered sufficient for a diagnosis in the BWS spectrum. Here, we report the case of a girl with right body asymmetry, which suggested BWS spectrum. Later, BWS/SRS molecular analysis identified IC1_LoM revealing the discrepant diagnosis of SRS. A clinical re-evaluation identified a relative macrocephaly and previously unidentified growth rate at lower limits of normal at birth, feeding difficulties, and asymmetry. Interestingly, and never previously described in IC1_LoM SRS patients, since the age of 16, she has developed hand-writer's cramps, depression, and bipolar disorder. Trio-WES identified aVPS16heterozygous variant [NM_022575.4:c.2185C>G:p.Leu729Val] inherited from her healthy mother. VPS16 is involved in the endolysosomal system, and its dysregulation is linked to autosomal dominant dystonia with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity. IGF2 involvement in the lysosomal pathway led us to speculate that the neurological phenotype of the proband might be triggered by the concurrent IGF2 deficit andVPS16alteration.Copyright © 2023 Vimercati, Tannorella, Orlandini, Calzari, Moro, Guzzetti, Selicorni, Crippa, Larizza, Bonati and Russo."

Herein, utilizing the rapid explosive volume expansion of the CoFe-bimetallic energetic metallic triazole framework (CoFe@E-MTF) during the heat treatment, the effective absorption bandwidth and the maximum absorption intensity of a series of atomic CoFe-inserted hierarchical porous carbon (CoFe@HPC) EWAs can be modified under the diverse synthetic temperature. Under the filler loading of 15 wt%, the fully covered X and Ku bands at 3 and 2.5 mm for CoFe@HPC800 and the superb minimum reflection loss (RLmin) of -53.15 dB and specific reflection loss (SRL) of -101.24 dB mg-1mm-1for CoFe@HPC1000 are achieved. More importantly, the single-atomic chemical bonding among Co─Fe on the nanopores is captured by extended X-ray absorption fine structure, which reveals the formation mechanism of nanopore-confined vortical dipoles and magnetic domains.

"37526299","Peripheral blood DNA methylation signatures and response to tofacitinib in moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.","J Crohns Colitis","Predictive biomarkers for treatment efficacy of ulcerative colitis (UC) treatments are lacking. Here, we performed a longitudinal study investigating the association and potential predictive power of genome-wide peripheral blood (PB) DNA methylation signatures and response to tofacitinib treatment in UC.We recruited moderate-to-severe UC patients starting tofacitinib treatment and measured PB DNA methylation profiles at baseline (T1), after 8 weeks (T2), and in a subset (n=8), after a median of 20 weeks (T3) using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation EPIC BeadChip. After 8 weeks, we categorized responders (R) from non-responders (NR) based on a centrally read endoscopic response (decrease in endoscopic mayo score ≥1 or UCEIS ≥2) combined with corticosteroid-free clinical- and/or biochemical response. T1 PB samples were used for biomarker identification, while T2 and publicly available intra-class correlation (ICC) data were used for stability analyses. RNA-sequencing was performed to understand the downstream effects of the predictor CpG loci.In total, 16 R and 15 NR patients with a median disease duration of 7 (4-12) years and overall comparable patient characteristics at baseline were analyzed. We identified a panel of 53 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) associated with response to tofacitinib (AUROC 0.74). Most DMPs (77%) demonstrated both short- and long-term hyper stability (ICC ≥0.90), irrespective of inflammatory status. Gene expression analysis showed lower FGFR2 (pBH=0.011) and LRPAP1 (pBH=0.020), and higher OR2L13 (pBH=0.016) expression at T1 in R compared to NR.Our observations demonstrate the utility of genome-wide PB DNA methylation signatures to predict response to tofacitinib.© The Author(s) 2023.

"37526137","The role of salinity on genome-wide DNA methylation dynamics in European sea bass gills.","Mol Ecol","Epigenetic modifications, like DNA methylation, generate phenotypic diversity in fish and ultimately lead to adaptive evolutionary processes. Euryhaline marine species that migrate between salinity-contrasted habitats have received little attention regarding the role of salinity on whole-genome DNA methylation. Investigation of salinity-induced DNA methylation in fish will help to better understand the potential role of this process in salinity acclimation. Using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, we compared DNA methylation patterns in European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) juveniles in seawater and after freshwater transfer. We targeted the gill as a crucial organ involved in plastic responses to environmental changes. To investigate the function of DNA methylation in gills, we performed RNAseq and assessed DNA methylome-transcriptome correlations. We showed a negative correlation between gene expression levels and DNA methylation levels in promoters, first introns and first exons. A significant effect of salinity on DNA methylation dynamics with an overall DNA hypomethylation in freshwater-transferred fish compared to seawater controls was demonstrated. This suggests a role of DNA methylation changes in salinity acclimation. Genes involved in key functions as metabolism, ion transport and transepithelial permeability (junctional complexes) were differentially methylated and expressed between salinity conditions. Expression of genes involved in mitochondrial metabolism (tricarboxylic acid cycle) was increased, whereas the expression of DNA methyltransferases 3a was repressed. This study reveals novel links between DNA methylation, mainly in promoters and first exons/introns, and gene expression patterns following salinity change.© 2023 The Authors.

"37525279","A meta-analysis of immune-cell fractions at high resolution reveals novel associations with common phenotypes and health outcomes.","Genome Med","Changes in cell-type composition of tissues are associated with a wide range of diseases and environmental risk factors and may be causally implicated in disease development and progression. However, these shifts in cell-type fractions are often of a low magnitude, or involve similar cell subtypes, making their reliable identification challenging. DNA methylation profiling in a tissue like blood is a promising approach to discover shifts in cell-type abundance, yet studies have only been performed at a relatively low cellular resolution and in isolation, limiting their power to detect shifts in tissue composition.Here we derive a DNA methylation reference matrix for 12 immune-cell types in human blood and extensively validate it with flow-cytometric count data and in whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data of sorted cells. Using this reference matrix, we perform a directional Stouffer and fixed effects meta-analysis comprising 23,053 blood samples from 22 different cohorts, to comprehensively map associations between the 12 immune-cell fractions and common phenotypes. In a separate cohort of 4386 blood samples, we assess associations between immune-cell fractions and health outcomes.Our meta-analysis reveals many associations of cell-type fractions with age, sex, smoking and obesity, many of which we validate with single-cell RNA sequencing. We discover that naïve and regulatory T-cell subsets are higher in women compared to men, while the reverse is true for monocyte, natural killer, basophil, and eosinophil fractions. Decreased natural killer counts associated with smoking, obesity, and stress levels, while an increased count correlates with exercise and sleep. Analysis of health outcomes revealed that increased naïve CD4 + T-cell and N-cell fractions associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality independently of all major epidemiological risk factors and baseline co-morbidity. A machine learning predictor built only with immune-cell fractions achieved a C-index value for all-cause mortality of 0.69 (95%CI 0.67-0.72), which increased to 0.83 (0.80-0.86) upon inclusion of epidemiological risk factors and baseline co-morbidity.This work contributes an extensively validated high-resolution DNAm reference matrix for blood, which is made freely available, and uses it to generate a comprehensive map of associations between immune-cell fractions and common phenotypes, including health outcomes.© 2023.

"37525248","Genetic impacts on DNA methylation help elucidate regulatory genomic processes.","Genome Biol","Pinpointing genetic impacts on DNA methylation can improve our understanding of pathways that underlie gene regulation and disease risk.We report heritability and methylation quantitative trait locus (meQTL) analysis at 724,499 CpGs profiled with the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC array in 2358 blood samples from three UK cohorts. Methylation levels at 34.2% of CpGs are affected by SNPs, and 98% of effects are cis-acting or within 1 Mbp of the tested CpG. Our results are consistent with meQTL analyses based on the former Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 array. Both SNPs and CpGs with meQTLs are overrepresented in enhancers, which have improved coverage on this platform compared to previous approaches. Co-localisation analyses across genetic effects on DNA methylation and 56 human traits identify 1520 co-localisations across 1325 unique CpGs and 34 phenotypes, including in disease-relevant genes, such as USP1 and DOCK7 (total cholesterol levels), and ICOSLG (inflammatory bowel disease). Enrichment analysis of meQTLs and integration with expression QTLs give insights into mechanisms underlying cis-meQTLs (e.g. through disruption of transcription factor binding sites for CTCF and SMC3) and trans-meQTLs (e.g. through regulating the expression of ACD and SENP7 which can modulate DNA methylation at distal sites).Our findings improve the characterisation of the mechanisms underlying DNA methylation variability and are informative for prioritisation of GWAS variants for functional follow-ups.

"37525122","Genome-wide characterization, evolutionary analysis, and expression pattern analysis of the trihelix transcription factor family and gene expression analysis under MeJA treatment in Panax ginseng.","BMC Plant Biol","Panax ginseng is a well-known medicinal plant with several pharmacological uses in China. The trihelix family transcription factors, also known as GT factors, can be involved in the regulation of growth and developmental processes in plants. There have been no in-depth reports or systematic studies about the trihelix transcription factor in ginseng. In this study, the structure, chromosomal localization, gene duplication, phylogeny, functional differentiation, expression patterns and coexpression interactions of trihelix transcripts were analysed using bioinformatics methods based on the ginseng transcriptome database. Thirty-two trihelix transcription factor genes were identified in ginseng, and these genes were alternatively spliced to obtain 218 transcripts. These transcripts were unevenly distributed on different chromosomes of ginseng, and phylogenetic analysis classified the PgGT transcripts into five subgroups. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis classified PgGT transcripts into eight functional subclasses, indicating that they are functionally diverse. The expression pattern analysis of 218 PgGT transcripts revealed that their expression was tissue-specific and spatiotemporally-specific in 14 different tissues of 4-year-old ginseng, 4 different ages of ginseng roots, and 42 farmers' cultivars of 4-year-old ginseng roots. Despite the differences in the expression patterns of these transcripts, coexpression network analysis revealed that these transcripts could be expressed synergistically in ginseng. In addition, two randomly selected PgGT transcripts in each of the five different subfamilies were subjected to methyl jasmonate treatment at different times, and PgGT was able to respond to the regulation of methy1 jasmonate. These results provide a theoretical basis and gene resources for an in-depth study of the function of trihelix genes in other plants.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37523633","Genome-wide methylation profile of mitochondrial DNA across bovine preimplantation development.","Epigenetics","This study characterized variations in the methylation profile of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) during initial bovine embryo development and correlated the presence of methylation with mtDNA transcription. Bovine oocytes were obtained from abattoir ovaries and submitted toin vitroculture procedures. Oocytes and embryos were collected at various stages (immature oocyte, IM; mature oocyte, MII; zygote, ZY; 4-cells, 4C; 16-cells, 16C and blastocysts, BL). Total DNA (including mtDNA) was used for Whole Genome Enzymatic Methyl Sequencing and for quantification of mtDNA copy number. Extracted RNA was used for quantification of mitochondrial transcripts using Droplet Digital PCR. We selected ND6, CYTB, tRNA-Phe and tRNA-Gln based on their location in the mitochondrial genome, functionality and/or previous literature associating these regions with cytosine methylation. The number of mtDNA copies per oocyte/embryo was found to be similar, while methylation levels in mtDNA varied among stages. Higher total methylation levels were found mainly at 4C and 16C. In specific gene regions, higher methylation levels were also observed at 4C and 16C (ND6, CYTB and tRNA-Phe), as well as an inverse correlation with the quantity of transcripts for these regions. This is a first description of epigenetic changes occurring in mtDNA during early embryonic development. Our results indicate that methylation might regulate the mtDNA transcription at a local level, particularly around the time of embryonic genome activation."

As inhibition ofS. mansoniepigenetic machinery components impairs key transitions throughout the parasite's digenetic lifecycle, a greater understanding of how epi-drugs affect molecular processes in schistosomes could lead to the development of new anthelmintics.Methods: Invitrowhole organism assays were used to assess the anti-schistosomal activity of 39Homo sapiensLysine Specific Demethylase 1 (HsLSD1) inhibitors on different parasite life cycle stages. Moreover, tissue-specific stains and genomic analysis shed light on the effect of these small molecules on the parasite biology.Results:Amongst this collection of small molecules, compound33was the most potent in reducingex vivoviabilities of schistosomula, juveniles, miracidia and adults. At its sub-lethal concentration to adults (3.13 µM), compound33also significantly impacted oviposition, ovarian as well as vitellarian architecture and gonadal/neoblast stem cell proliferation. ATAC-seq analysis of adults demonstrated that compound33significantly affected chromatin structure (intragenic regions > intergenic regions), especially in genes differentially expressed in cell populations (e.g., germinal stem cells, hes2+stem cell progeny, S1 cells and late female germinal cells) associated with theseex vivophenotypes. KEGG analyses further highlighted that chromatin structure of genes associated with sugar metabolism as well as TGF-beta and Wnt signalling were also significantly perturbed by compound33treatment.Conclusions:This work confirms the importance of histone methylation inS. mansonilifecycle transitions, suggesting that evaluation of LSD1 - targeting epi-drugs may facilitate the search for next-generation anti-schistosomal drugs. The ability of compound33to modulate chromatin structure as well as inhibit parasite survival, oviposition and stem cell proliferation warrants further investigations of this compound and its epigenetic target SmLSD1.Copyright: © 2023 Padalino G et al."
"37516234","Epigenetic modification related to cognitive changes during a cognitive training intervention in depression.","Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry","DNA methylation as a biomarker is well suited to investigate dynamic processes, such as symptom improvement. For this study we focus on epigenomic state or trait markers as early signatures of cognitive improvement in individuals receiving a cognitive intervention. We performed a first epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) on patients with cognitive dysfunction in depression comparing those with vs without cognitive dysfunction and those cognitively improving vs non-improving following a cognitive intervention.Data from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) were used for this analysis, where cognitive function of 112 patients randomly assigned to a personalized cognitive intervention was compared to standard cognitive treatment. Cognition was measured for this study using the four cognitive tasks from the THINC-it battery. We compared individuals with cognitive impairment with individuals without cognitive impairment at baseline and after a cognitive intervention of 8 weeks. Blood for DNA methylation analysis (Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC 850 k BeadChip) was collected at baseline and 8 weeks into the treatment. For the baseline analysis, after quality control, the final sample comprised 90 individuals, and analyses at week 8 were performed on 84 individuals. Data cleaning, quality control, and differential methylation analysis of DNA methylation data was performed using the RnBeads package (R). Analyses were corrected for gender, age, depression score (MADRS), reported years of education, height and weight, as well as surrogate variables estimated by the pipeline used. The within-individual paired longitudinal analysis was performed using Welch's t-test.Analyses at baseline and at week 8 did not show any genome-wide significant CpGs (p < 5 × 10-8) comparing patients with and without cognitive impairment. The most significant result in the baseline analysis comparing the groups with and without cognitive impairment at baseline is located in an open Sea region with predominantly regulatory qualities (cg10962945; 6.61 × 10-7). The most significant CpG at 8 weeks was also located in open sea, though in exon 13 of the NTRK2-gene, linked to the BDNF pathway (cg13620631, 5.56 × 10-7). Finally, a within-individual paired longitudinal analysis with only patients that show improved cognitive function over time was performed, showing 65 CpGs that overlapped between the 1% most significant of this analysis and the 1% most significant CpGs from the cross-sectional analysis at 8 weeks.Our result suggest that DNA methylation can be suitable to capture early signs of treatment response of a cognitive intervention in depression. In our layered approach we could capture dynamics that can help differentiate between biological trait and state markers of cognitive function in depression. Despite not being genome-wide significant, the CpG locations returned by our analysis comparing patients with and without cognitive impairment, are in line with prior knowledge on pathways and genes relevant for depression treatment and cognition.Copyright © 2023.

"37515809","Impact of testicular cancer on sperm small non-coding RNA signature: a pilot study.","Epigenetics","Testicular germ cell tumours (TGCTs) are the most common tumours in young adults of European ancestry. The high heritability and the constantly increased incidence, which has doubled over the last 20 years, strongly suggest that both genetic and environmental factors are likely to shape the TGCT susceptibility. While genome-wide association studies have identified loci associated with TGCT susceptibility, the role played by environmental molecular vectors in TGCT susceptibility remains unclear. Evidence shows that sperm non-coding RNAs provide a good vision of the environmental stresses experienced by men. Here, to determine whether TGCT impacts the abundance of specific non-coding RNAs in sperm, small RNA deep sequencing analysis of sperm of 25 men aged between 19 and 42 years, diagnosed with (n = 16) or without (n = 9) TGCT was performed. The primary analysis showed no statistical significance in the sncRNA population between the TGCT and non-TGCT groups. However, when sperm physiological parameters were considered to look for differentially expressed sncRNA, we evidenced 11 differentially expressed sncRNA between patients and control which allow a clear discrimination between control and TGCT samples after Hierarchical Clustering analysis. Together, these findings indicate that sperm small non-coding RNAs abundance may have the potential for diagnosing men with TGCT. However, specific care should be taken regarding sperm physiological parameters of the TGCT patients. Hence, larger studies are needed to confirm our findings and to determine whether such a signature associates with the risks to develop TGCT."
"37514334","Catalase Gene Family in Durum Wheat: Genome-Wide Analysis and Expression Profiling in Response to Multiple Abiotic Stress Conditions.","Plants (Basel)","Catalase (CAT) is an antioxidant enzyme expressed by theCATgene family and exists in almost all aerobic organisms. In fact, the CAT enzyme modulates the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) contents in cells by translating this toxic compound into water (H2O) and O2-to reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) contents in cells. ROS are produced as a result of biotic and abiotic environmental stressors. To avoid ROS toxicity, plants are armed with different enzymatic and non-enzymatic systems to decompose ROS. Among the enzymatic system, CAT proteins are well studied. CAT not only controls growth and development in plants but is also involved in plant defense against different stresses. So far, theCATgene family has not been reported in durum wheat (Triticum turgidumssp.durumL.). Therefore, a genome-wide comprehensive analysis was conducted to classify theCATgenes in the durum wheat genome. Here, sixTdCATgenes were identified. Based on phylogenetics, theTdCATgenes belong to three groups (Groups I-III) which is explainable by their comparable structural characteristics. Using bio-informatic analysis, we found that the secondary and tertiary structures were conserved among plants and present similar structures among durum wheat CATs. Two conserved domains (pfam00199 and pfam06628) are also present in all identified proteins, which have different subcellular localizations: peroxisome and mitochondrion. By analyzing their promoters, different cis-elements were identified, such as hormone-correlated response and stress-related responsive elements. Finally, we studied the expression pattern of two catalase genes belonging to two different sub-classes under different abiotic stresses. Expression profiling revealed that TdCAT2 and TdCAT3 presented a constitutive expression pattern. Moreover, both genes are induced in response to salt, mannitol, cold, heat and ABA. Thus, we speculate that those genes are activated by different stresses, such as oxygen deficiency, light, cold, abscisic acid and methyl jasmonate. Further, this study will help in understanding the behavior ofCATgenes during environmental stress in durum wheat and inTriticeaespecies in general."

Epigenetic modifications mediate these associations by causing changes in gene expression. We studied the association between GWG and DNA methylation in umbilical cord tissue; and determined whether the DNA methylation and the expression of corresponding annotated genes were associated with obesity-related parameters in offspring at 6 years of age. The methylated CpG sites (CpGs) associated with GWG were identified in umbilical cord tissue by genome-wide DNA methylation (n= 24). Twelve top CpGs were validated in a wider sample by pyrosequencing (n= 87), and the expression of their 5 annotated genes (SETD8,TMEM214,SLIT3,RPTOR, andHOXC8) was assessed by RT-PCR. Pyrosequencing results validated the association of SETD8, SLIT3, and RPTOR methylation with GWG and showed that higher levels ofSETD8andRPTORmethylation and lower levels ofSLIT3methylation relate to a higher risk of obesity in the offspring. The association ofSETD8andSLIT3gene expression with offspring outcomes paralleled the association of methylation levels in opposite directions. Epigenetic changes in the umbilical cord tissue could explain, in part, the relationship between GWG and offspring obesity risk and be early biomarkers for the prevention of overweight and obesity in childhood."

Its epigenome can be regarded as a biochemical record of the prenatal environment and a potential mechanism of its association with the future health of the fetus. We investigated associations between placental DNA methylation levels and child behavioral and emotional difficulties, assessed at 3 years of age using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) in 441 mother-child dyads from the EDEN cohort. Hypothesis-driven and exploratory analyses (on differentially methylated probes (EWAS) and regions (DMR)) were adjusted for confounders, technical factors, and cell composition estimates, corrected for multiple comparisons, and stratified by child sex. Hypothesis-driven analyses showed an association of cg26703534 (AHRR) with emotional symptoms, and exploratory analyses identified two probes, cg09126090 (intergenic region) and cg10305789 (PPP1R16B), as negatively associated with peer relationship problems, as well as 33 DMRs, mostly positively associated with at least one of the SDQ subscales. Among girls, most associations were seen with emotional difficulties, whereas in boys, DMRs were as much associated with emotional than behavioral difficulties. This study provides the first evidence of associations between placental DNA methylation and child behavioral and emotional difficulties. Our results suggest sex-specific associations and might provide new insights into the mechanisms of neurodevelopment."

Sugar beet is a salt-tolerant sugar-yielding crop, but how m6A modification affects its response to salt stress remains unknown. In this study, m6A-seq was used to explore the role of m6A modification in response to salt stress in sugar beet (Beta vulgaris). Transcriptome-wide m6A methylation profiles and physiological responses to high salinity were investigated in beet roots. After treatment with 300 mM NaCl, the activities of peroxidase and catalase, the root activity, and the contents of Na+, K+, and Ca2+in the roots were significantly affected by salt stress. Compared with the control plants, 6904 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 566 differentially methylated peaks (DMPs) were identified. Association analysis revealed that 243 DEGs contained DMP, and 80% of these DEGs had expression patterns that were negatively correlated with the extent of m6A modification. Further analysis verified that m6A methylation may regulate the expression of some genes by controlling their mRNA stability. Functional analysis revealed that m6A modifications primarily affect the expression of genes involved in energy metabolism, transport, signal transduction, transcription factors, and cell wall organization. This study provides evidence that a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism mediates gene expression during salt stress by affecting the stability of mRNA in the root."

We sought to identify the DNA methylation status of CpG sites associated with reduced kidney function and examine whether the identified CpG sites are associated with CKD development.We analyzed DNA methylation patterns of 440 participants in the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES) with estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs) ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2at baseline. CKD development was defined as a decrease in the eGFR of <60 at any time during an 8-year follow-up period (""CKD prediction"" analysis). In addition, among the 440 participants, 49 participants who underwent a second methylation profiling were assessed for an association between a decline in kidney function and changes in the degree of methylation of CpG sites during the 8 years (""kidney function slope"" analysis).In the CKD prediction analysis, methylation profiles of a total of 403,129 CpG sites were evaluated at baseline in 440 participants, and increased and decreased methylation of 268 and 189 CpG sites, respectively, were significantly correlated with the development of CKD in multivariable logistic regression. During kidney function slope analysis using follow-up methylation profiles of 49 participants, the percent methylation changes in 913 CpG sites showed a linear relationship with the percent change in eGFR during 8 years. During functional enrichment analyses for significant CpG sites found in the CKD prediction and kidney function slope analyses, we found that those CpG sites represented MAPK, PI3K/Akt, and Rap1 pathways. In addition, three CpG sites from three genes,NPHS2,CHCHD4, andAHR, were found to be significant in the CKD prediction analysis and related to a decline in kidney function.It is suggested that DNA methylation on specific genes is associated with the development of CKD and the deterioration of kidney function."

The molecular impact of such treatment is unknown. We conducted longitudinal transcriptome and epigenome analyses in patients (n= 100) receiving amoxicillin treatment or placebo for 100 days in the Antibiotics in Modic Changes (AIM) study. Gene expression and DNA methylation were investigated at a genome-wide level at screening, after 100 days of treatment, and at one-year follow-up. We identified intra-individual longitudinal changes in gene expression and DNA methylation in patients receiving amoxicillin, while few changes were observed in patients receiving placebo. After 100 days of amoxicillin treatment, 28 genes were significantly differentially expressed, including the downregulation of 19 immunoglobulin genes. At one-year follow-up, the expression levels were still not completely restored. The significant changes in DNA methylation (n= 4548 CpGs) were mainly increased methylation levels between 100 days and one-year follow-up. Hence, the effects on gene expression occurred predominantly during treatment, while the effects on DNA methylation occurred after treatment. In conclusion, unrecognized side effects of long-term amoxicillin treatment were revealed, as alterations were observed in both gene expression and DNA methylation that lasted long after the end of treatment."

We evaluated the DNA methylomes of 87 individuals including 41 SLE patients, with and without LN, and 46 controls enrolled in an ancestry diverse, well-characterized cohort study of established SLE (41 SLE patients [20 SLE-LN+, 21 SLE-LN-] and 46 sex-, race- and age-matched controls; 55% African American, 45% European American). Participants were genotyped using the Infinium Global Diversity Array (GDA), and genetic ancestry was estimated using principal components. Genome-wide DNA methylation was initially measured using the Illumina MethylationEPIC 850K Beadchip array followed by methylation-specific qPCR to validate the methylation status at putative loci. Differentially Methylated Positions (DMP) were identified using a case-control approach adjusted for ancestry. We identified a total of 51 DMPs in CpGs among SLE patients compared to controls. Genes proximal to these CpGs were highly enriched for involvement in type I interferon signaling. DMPs among European American SLE patients with LN were similar to African American SLE patients with and without LN. Our findings were validated using an orthogonal, methyl-specific PCR for three SLE-associated DMPs near or proximal to MX1, USP18, and IFITM1. Our study confirms previous reports that DMPs in CpGs associated with SLE are enriched in type I interferon genes. However, we show that European American SLE patients with LN have similar DNAm patterns to African American SLE patients irrespective of LN, suggesting that aberrant DNAm alters activity of type I interferon pathway leading to more severe disease independent of ancestry.Copyright © 2023.

"37503194","An epigenome-wide association study of child appetitive traits and DNA methylation.","bioRxiv","Childhood appetitive traits are consistently associated with obesity risk, and yet their etiology is poorly understood. Appetitive traits are complex phenotypes which are hypothesized to be influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, as well as their interactions. Early-life epigenetic processes, such as DNA methylation (DNAm), may be involved in the developmental programming of appetite regulation in childhood. In the current study, we meta-analyzed epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) of cord blood DNAm and early-childhood appetitive traits. Data were from two independent cohorts: the Generation R Study (n=1,086, Rotterdam, the Netherlands) and the Healthy Start study (n=236, Colorado, USA). DNAm at autosomal methylation sites in cord blood was measured using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Parents reported on their child's food responsiveness, emotional undereating, satiety responsiveness and food fussiness using the Children's Eating Behaviour Questionnaire at age 4-5 years. Multiple regression models were used to examine the association of DNAm (predictor) at the individual site- and regional-level (using DMRff) with each appetitive trait (outcome), adjusting for covariates. Bonferroni-correction was applied to adjust for multiple testing. There were no associations of DNAm and any appetitive trait at the individual site-level. However, at the regional level, we identified 45 associations of DNAm with food responsiveness, 7 associations of DNAm with emotional undereating, 13 associations of DNAm with satiety responsiveness, and 9 associations of DNAm with food fussiness. This study shows that DNAm in the newborn may partially explain variation in appetitive traits expressed in early childhood and provides preliminary support for early programming of child appetitive traits through DNAm. Investigating differential DNAm associated with appetitive traits could be an important first step in identifying biological pathways underlying the development of these behaviors."

Robust, high-throughput single-cell DNA methylation assays are now possible (sciMET); however, the genome-wide nature of DNA methylation results in a high sequencing burden per cell. Here, we leverage target enrichment with sciMET to capture sufficient information per cell for cell type assignment using substantially fewer sequence reads (sciMET-cap). Sufficient off-target coverage further enables the production of near-complete methylomes for individual cell types. We characterize sciMET-cap on human PBMCs and brain (middle frontal gyrus)."

To gain a better understanding of the link between epigenetics (DNA methylation) and AS/PH, we examined the relationship of eight measures of AS/PH with CpG sites and co-methylated regions using multi-ancestry participants from Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) with sample sizes ranging from 438 to 874. Epigenome-wide association analysis identified one genome-wide significant CpG (cg20711926-CYP1B1) associated with aortic augmentation index (AIx). Follow-up analyses, including gene set enrichment analysis, expression quantitative trait methylation analysis, and functional enrichment analysis on differentially methylated positions and regions, further prioritized three CpGs and their annotated genes (cg23800023-ETS1, cg08426368-TGFB3, and cg17350632-HLA-DPB1) for AIx. Among these,ETS1andTGFB3have been previously prioritized as candidate genes. Furthermore, bothETS1andHLA-DPB1have significant tissue correlations between Whole Blood and Aorta in GTEx, which suggestsETS1andHLA-DPB1could be potential biomarkers in understanding pathophysiology of AS/PH. Overall, our findings support the possible role of epigenetic regulation via DNA methylation of specific genes associated with AIx as well as identifying potential targets for regulation of AS/PH."

Among them, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), as the top acute leukemia for adults, is a deadly disease threatening human health. Although N7-methylguanosine (m7G) has been identified as an important regulatory modification, its distribution has still remained elusive.The present study aimed to explore the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) functional profile of m7G in AML and drug-resistant AML cells. The transcriptome-wide m7G methylation of lncRNA was analyzed in AML and drug-resistant AML cells. RNA MeRIP-seq was performed to identify m7G peaks on lncRNA and differences in m7G distribution between AML and drug-resistant AML cells. The Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were conducted to predict the possible roles and m7G-associated pathway.Using m7G peak sequencing, it was found that a sequence motif was necessary for m7G methylation in drug-resistant AML lncRNA. Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis confirmed that lncRNA m7G methylation occurred more frequently in drug-resistant AML cells than in AML cells. RNA sequencing demonstrated that more genes were upregulated by methylation in drug-resistant AML cells, while methylation downregulated more genes in AML cells. The GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses revealed that genes having a significant correlation with m7G sites in lncRNA were involved in drug-resistant AML signaling pathways.Significant differences in the levels and patterns of m7G methylation between drug-resistant AML cells and AML cells were revealed. Furthermore, the cellular functions potentially influenced by m7G in drug-resistant AML cells were predicted, providing evidence implicating m7G-mediated lncRNA epigenetic regulation in the progression of drug resistance in AML. These findings highlight the involvement of m7G in the development of drug resistance in AML.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) methylation has shown favorable performance in the detection and monitoring the malignant progression in a variety of cancers.To discover cfDNA methylation markers for the diagnosis of CRC, we first performed a genome-wide analysis between eight CRC and eight polyp tissues using the Infinium HumanMethylationEPIC BeadChip. We identified 7008 DMCs, and after filtering, we validated 39 DMCs by MethylTarget sequencing in 62 CRC and 56 polyp tissues. A panel of four CpGs (cg04486886, cg06712559, cg13539460, and cg27541454) was selected as the methylation marker in tissue by LASSO and random forest models. A diagnosis prediction model was built based on the four CpGs, and the methylation diagnosis score (md-score) can effectively discriminate tissues with CRC from polyp patients (AUROC > 0.9). Finally, the cg27541454 was confirmed hypermethylated in CRC (AUC = 0.85) in the plasma validation cohort.Our findings suggest that the md-score could robustly detect CRC from polyp tissues, and cg27541454 may be a promising candidate noninvasive biomarker for CRC early diagnosis.© 2023.

"37500008","Study protocol for the Mindful Moms Study: A randomized controlled trial evaluating a mindful movement intervention for marginalized pregnant people experiencing depression.","Contemp Clin Trials","More than 1 in 5 pregnant people in the United States experience depressive symptoms. Although treatments exist, many people remain under- or un-treated due to concerns about stigma, side effects, and costs of medications or psychotherapy, particularly those who are marginalized (defined as those who are minoritized, low-income, or with low-educational attainment). Further, the standard depression treatments do not address social connectedness, which is a potentially modifiable factor involved in depressive symptom etiology. This protocol presents the rationale, design, and status of the two-arm longitudinal parallel group randomized controlled trial - the Mindful Moms Study - which aims to evaluate the effects and mechanisms of a group-based mindful physical activity (yoga) intervention in marginalized pregnant people with depressive symptoms (n = 200) compared to a prenatal education control group. The primary aim is to evaluate effects of group assignment on depressive symptom severity, anxiety, and perceived stress over time from baseline to six weeks postpartum. Secondary aims include understanding the role of social connectedness as a moderator of the effects and to identify genome-wide DNA methylation patterns associated with depressive symptoms and perceived social connectedness at postpartum. A focus on adequate symptom management through non-pharmacologic, accessible therapies that address social connectedness during pregnancy in marginalized women is an urgent clinical and research priority. The successful completion of this study will provide important insights into social connectedness as a mechanism to decrease depressive symptoms in a largely understudied population.

It found that aberrant DNA methylation in B cells can induce the production of autoantibodies. Therefore, we attempted to explore if similar aberrant DNA methylation occur in AIHA patients.A 49-year-old female wAIHA patient and a 47-year-old female healthy control (HC) were enrolled. Peripheral blood (PB) B cells DNA was extracted. After constructing genomic libraries, bisulfite genomic sequencing (BSP) and DNA methylation profiles were analyzed. BSP was verified using PB B cells from 10 patients with hemolysis, 10 patients with hemolytic remission, and 10 healthy controls (HCs) by Methylation-specific PCR.Total DNA methylation of whole-genome C bases (4.8%) and CG type bases (76.8%) in wAIHA patient were lower than those in the HC (5.3 and 82.5%, respectively) (p = 0.022 andp < 0.001). DNA methylation of C bases and CG type bases in whole-genome regulatory elements, such as coding sequence, up2Kb and down2Kb in the patient were also lower than those in the HC (p = 0.041,p = 0.038, andp = 0.029). 30,180 DNA-methylated regions (DMRs) on all 23 chromosomes were identified. DMR-related genes were mainly involved in the Rap1, phospholipase D, HIF-1, calcium, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Ras signaling pathways.The DNA methylation spectrum of B cells in AIHA patients is different from that of HC, and the proportion of hypo-methylation regions is higher than that of HC. DMR-related genes are mainly related to some signaling pathways."

A cell-specific gene expression pattern defines the identity of insulin-producing pancreatic β cells, yet molecular networks driving this transcriptional specificity are not fully understood. Here, we investigated the HDAC-dependent molecular mechanisms controlling pancreatic β-cell identity and function using the pan-HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A through chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and RNA sequencing experiments. We observed that TSA alters insulin secretion associated with β-cell specific transcriptome programming in both mouse and human β-cell lines, as well as on human pancreatic islets. We also demonstrated that this alternative β-cell transcriptional program in response to HDAC inhibition is related to an epigenome-wide remodeling at both promoters and enhancers. Our data indicate that HDAC activity could be required to protect against loss of β-cell identity with unsuitable expression of genes associated with alternative cell fates.© 2023 The Author(s)."
"37496173","The lipidomic correlates of epigenetic aging across the adult lifespan: A population-based study.","Aging Cell","Lipid signaling is involved in longevity regulation, but which specific lipid molecular species affect human biological aging remains largely unknown. We investigated the relation between complex lipids and DNA methylation-based metrics of biological aging among 4181 participants (mean age 55.1 years (range 30.0-95.0)) from the Rhineland Study, an ongoing population-based cohort study in Bonn, Germany. The absolute concentration of 14 lipid classes, covering 964 molecular species and 267 fatty acid composites, was measured by Metabolon Complex Lipid Panel. DNA methylation-based metrics of biological aging (AgeAccelPheno and AgeAccelGrim) were calculated based on published algorithms. Epigenome-wide association analyses (EWAS) of biological aging-associated lipids and pathway analysis were performed to gain biological insights into the mechanisms underlying the effects of lipidomics on biological aging. We found that higher levels of molecular species belonging to neutral lipids, phosphatidylethanolamines, phosphatidylinositols, and dihydroceramides were associated with faster biological aging, whereas higher levels of lysophosphatidylcholine, hexosylceramide, and lactosylceramide species were associated with slower biological aging. Ceramide, phosphatidylcholine, and lysophosphatidylethanolamine species with odd-numbered fatty acid tail lengths were associated with slower biological aging, whereas those with even-numbered chain lengths were associated with faster biological aging. EWAS combined with functional pathway analysis revealed several complex lipids associated with biological aging as important regulators of known longevity and aging-related pathways.© 2023 The Authors.

"37496159","Relationships between the maternal prenatal diet and epigenetic state in infants: a systematic review of human studies.","J Dev Orig Health Dis","Most human studies investigating the relationship between maternal diet in pregnancy and infant epigenetic state have focused on macro- and micro-nutrient intake, rather than the whole diet. This makes it difficult to translate the evidence into practical prenatal dietary recommendations.To review the evidence on how the prenatal diet relates to the epigenetic state of infants measured in the first year of life via candidate gene or genome-wide approaches.Following the PRISMA guidelines, this systematic literature search was completed in August 2020, and updated in August 2021 and April 2022. Studies investigating dietary supplementation were excluded. Risk of bias was assessed, and the certainty of results was analysed with consideration of study quality and validity.Seven studies were included, encompassing 6852 mother-infant dyads. One study was a randomised controlled trial and the remaining six were observational studies. There was heterogeneity in dietary exposure measures. Three studies used an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) design and four focused on candidate genes from cord blood samples. All studies showed inconsistent associations between maternal dietary measures and DNA methylation in infants. Effect sizes of maternal diet on DNA methylation ranged from very low (< 1%) to high (> 10%). All studies had limitations and were assessed as having moderate to high risk of bias.The evidence presented here provides very low certainty that dietary patterns in pregnancy relate to epigenetic state in infants. We recommend that future studies maximise sample sizes and optimise and harmonise methods of dietary measurement and pipelines of epigenetic analysis."

We fill this knowledge gap by conducting the first genome-wide survey of DNA methylation in the deep-sea polychaetes dominant in deep-sea vents and seeps: Paraescarpia echinospica, Ridgeia piscesae and Paralvinella palmiformis. DNA methylation calls were inferred from Oxford Nanopore sequencing after assembling high-quality genomes of these animals. The genomes of these worms encode all the key enzymes of the DNA methylation metabolism and possess a mosaic methylome similar to that of other invertebrates. Transcriptomic data of these polychaetes support the hypotheses that gene body methylation strengthens the expression of housekeeping genes and that promoter methylation acts as a silencing mechanism but not the hypothesis that DNA methylation suppress the activity of transposable elements. The conserved epigenetic profiles of genes responsible for maintaining homeostasis under extreme hydrostatic pressure suggest DNA methylation plays an important adaptive role in these worms.© The Author(s) 2023.

While cancer subtypes are often characterized by differences in gene expression, the mechanisms driving these differences are generally unknown. We set out to model the regulatory mechanisms driving sarcoma heterogeneity based on patient-specific, genome-wide gene regulatory networks. We developed a new computational framework, PORCUPINE, which combines knowledge on biological pathways with permutation-based network analysis to identify pathways that exhibit significant regulatory heterogeneity across a patient population. We applied PORCUPINE to patient-specific leiomyosarcoma networks modeled on data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and validated our results in an independent dataset from the German Cancer Research Center. PORCUPINE identified 37 heterogeneously regulated pathways, including pathways representing potential targets for treatment of subgroups of leiomyosarcoma patients, such as FGFR and CTLA4 inhibitory signaling. We validated the detected regulatory heterogeneity through analysis of networks and chromatin states in leiomyosarcoma cell lines. We showed that the heterogeneity identified with PORCUPINE is not associated with methylation profiles or clinical features, thereby suggesting an independent mechanism of patient heterogeneity driven by the complex landscape of gene regulatory interactions.© The Author(s) 2023.

We developed a non-parametric permutation-based procedure to establish stringent statistical criteria to control the risk of false-positive associations in enhancer-gene association studies (EGAS). We applied our procedure to large-scale transcriptome and epigenome data from multiple tissues and species, including the mouse and human brain, to predict enhancer-gene associations genome wide.

We first performed an inverse-variance genome-wide association meta-analysis of 4,043 cases and 21,729 controls of European ancestry. In a secondary trans-ancestry meta-analysis we included 734 cases and 9,846 controls of East Asian ancestry. Candidate causal genes were prioritized by five complementary methods: expression quantitative trait loci, transcriptome-wide association, fine-mapping of causal gene sets, genetically driven DNA methylation, and effects on protein structure. Gene set and tissue enrichment analyses, genetic correlation, genetic risk score analysis and Mendelian randomization were part of the downstream analyses.The estimated SNP-based heritability of cluster headache was 14.5%. We identified nine independent signals in seven genome-wide significant loci in the primary meta-analysis, and one additional locus in the trans-ethnic meta-analysis. Five of the loci were previously known. The 20 genes prioritized as potentially causal for cluster headache showed enrichment to artery and brain tissue. Cluster headache was genetically correlated with cigarette smoking, risk-taking behavior, ADHD, depression and musculoskeletal pain. Mendelian randomization analysis indicated a causal effect of cigarette smoking intensity on cluster headache. Three of the identified loci were shared with migraine.This first genome-wide association study meta-analysis gives clues to the biological basis of cluster headache and indicates that smoking is a causal risk factor.

However, the exact mechanisms of tumourigenesis remain unclear. Although some genetic mutations have been reported, DNA methylation alterations in canine HCT have not been well studied.In this study, we aimed to analyse the DNA methylation status of canine HCT.Tissues from 33 hepatocellular carcinomas, 3 hepatocellular adenomas, 1 nodular hyperplasia, 21 non-tumour livers from the patients and normal livers from 5 healthy dogs were used. We analysed the DNA methylation levels of 72,367 cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpG sites) in all 63 samples.Although a large fraction of CpG sites that were highly methylated in the normal liver became hypomethylated in tumours from most patients, we also found some patients with less remarkable change or no change in DNA methylation. Hierarchical clustering analysis revealed that 32 of 37 tumour samples differed from normal livers, although the remaining 5 tumour livers fell into the same cluster as normal livers. In addition, the number of hypermethylated genes in tumour livers varied among tumour cases, suggesting various DNA methylation patterns in different tumour groups. However, patient and clinical parameters, such as age, were not associated with DNA methylation status. In conclusion, we found that HCTs undergo aberrant and diverse patterns of genome-wide DNA methylation compared with normal liver tissue, suggesting a complex epigenetic mechanism in canine HCT.© 2023 The Authors.

Given the high number of comparisons performed in -omic research, further studies were needed to validate and extend on these findings. Using a cohort of male and female fetuses with repeated maternal urine samples to assess exposure, we studied the associations between triclosan and placental DNA methylation. We assessed triclosan concentrations in two pools of 21 urine samples collected among 395 women from the SEPAGES cohort. We used Infinium Methylation EPIC arrays to measure DNA methylation in placental biopsies collected at delivery. We performed a candidate study restricted to a set of candidate CpGs (n = 500) identified in a previous work as well as an exploratory epigenome-wide association study to investigate the associations between triclosan and differentially methylated probes and regions. Analyses were conducted on the whole population and stratified by child's sex. Mediation analysis was performed to test whether heterogeneity of placental tissue may mediate the observed associations. In the candidate approach, we confirmed 18 triclosan-associated genes when both sexes were considered. After stratification for child's sex, triclosan was associated with 72 genes in females and three in males. Most of the associations were positive and several CpGs mapped to imprinted genes: FBRSL1, KCNQ1, RHOBTB3, and SMOC1. A mediation effect by placental tissue heterogeneity was identified for most of the observed associations. In the exploratory analysis, we identified a few isolated associations in the sex-stratified analysis. In line with a previous study on male placentas, our approach revealed several positive associations between triclosan exposure and placental DNA methylation.

Recent epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) have uncovered pervasive dysregulation of DNA methylation in schizophrenia, however, clinical features of the disorder which account for a large proportion of phenotypic variability remain relatively underexplored.We comprehensively analysed patterns of DNA methylation in a cohort of 381 individuals with schizophrenia from the deeply phenotyped Australian Schizophrenia Research Bank. Epigenetic changes were investigated in association with cognitive status, age of onset, treatment resistance, Global Assessment of Function scores, and common variant polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia. We subsequently explored alterations within genes previously associated with psychiatric illness, phenome-wide epigenetic covariance, and epigenetic scores.EWAS of the five primary traits identified 662 suggestively significant (P < 6.72x10-5) differentially methylated probes, with a further 432 revealed after controlling for schizophrenia polygenic risk on the remaining four traits. Interestingly, we uncovered many probes neighbouring genes associated with a variety of psychiatric conditions, as well as significant epigenetic covariance with phenotypes and exposures including acute myocardial infarction, C-reactive protein, and lung cancer. Epigenetic scores for treatment-resistant schizophrenia strikingly exhibited association with clozapine administration, while epigenetic proxies of plasma protein expression, such as CCL17, MMP10, and PRG2, were associated with several features of schizophrenia.Our findings collectively provide novel evidence suggesting several features of schizophrenia are associated with alteration of DNA methylation, which may contribute to inter-individual phenotypic variation in affected individuals.Copyright © 2023.

Previous in-vitro analyses revealed efficacy of decitabine (DCT), a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor established in the treatment of leukemia, in a yet undefined subgroup of meningiomas.Effects of DCT on proliferation and viability was analyzed in primary meningioma cells by immunofluorescence and MTT assays, and cases were classified as drug responders and non-responders. Molecular preconditions for efficacy were analyzed using immunofluorescence for Ki67, DNMT1, and five oncogenes (TRIM58, FAM84B, ELOVL2, MAL2, LMO3) previously found to be differentially methylated after DCT exposition, as well as by genome-wide DNA methylation analyses.Efficacy of DCT (10µM) was found in eight (62%) of 13 meningioma cell lines 48 h after drug exposition (p < .05). DCT significantly reduced DNMT1 expression in all but two cell lines, and median ΔDNMT1 reduction 48 h after drug exposition was lower in DCT-resistant (-11.1%) than in DCT-sensitive (-50.5%, p = .030) cells. Rates of cell lines responsive to DCT exposition distinctly decreased to 25% after 72 h. No significant correlation of the patients´ age, sex, histological subtype, location of the paternal tumor, expression of Ki67, DNMT1 or the analyzed oncogenes with treatment response was found (p > .05, each). DCT efficacy was further independent of the methylation class and global DNA methylation of the paternal tumor.Early effects of DCT in meningiomas are strongly related with DNMT1 expression, while clinical, histological, and molecular predictors for efficacy are sparse. Kinetics of drug efficacy might indicate necessity of repeated exposition and encourage further analyses.© 2023.

Herein, we found that starvation activated autophagy to remodel the DNA methylation profile by inhibiting DNMT3a expression.Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip and dot blot assay were performed to quantify the global DNA methylation level. Protein-RNA interactions were validated through RNA immunoprecipitation and RNA pull-down assay. In vitro and in vivo experiments were carried out to testify the effect of DNMT3a on chemoresistance.Autophagy is impaired in chemoresistance which was associated with differential DNA methylation and could be reversed by DNMT3a inhibition. Autophagy activation decreases the expression of DNMT3a mRNA, accompanied with the downregulation of chemoresistance-related Linc00942. Knockdown of Linc00942 reduces DNMT3a expression and genome-wide DNA methylation while Linc00942 overexpression increased DNMT3a expression and correlated hypermethylation in cancer cells and primary tumour tissues. Mechanistically, Linc00942 recruits RNA methyltransferase METTL3 to stimulate N6-methyladenosine (m6A) deposit on DNMT3a transcripts, triggering IGF2BP3/HuR to recognize modified mRNA for reinforced stability. SQSTM1/p62 recruits Linc00942 for autophagic degradation which can be abrogated after autophagy inhibition by p62 knockdown or chloroquine treatment.Inhibition of autophagy increases Linc00942 expression to promote chemoresistance and autophagy activation or hypomethylating agent decitabine restores chemosensitivity by reducing global DNA methylation. Overall, this study identifies a novel methylation cascade linking impaired RNautophagy to global hypermethylation in chemoresistance, and provides a rationale for repurposing decitabine to overcome chemoresistance in cancer treatment.© 2023 The Authors.

We profiled hepatic gene expression by RNA-Sequencing and locus-specific 5-methylcytosine level, using Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS).We identified >1000 differentially methylated regions in NASH versus control group, indicating that NASH diet could modulate the liver methylome. Furthermore, integrated analysis of methylome and transcriptome identified certain key methylated genes and pathways, which may be involved in steroid metabolism and inflammation response. The liver methylation levels of key genes especially Tgfb, Msn, Iqgap1, Cyba, Fcgr1 decreased, and their consequent increased expression may lead to NASH development.We found that HFHC diet-induced NASH could induces genome-wide differential DNA methylation changes. Thus, we proposed that DNA methylation profiles of genomes may be a useful signature of gene transcription and may play an important role in the development of NASH. We also screened and validated the changes of key genes, which may provide new perspectives for the mechanistic study of NASH in future.Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier Inc."

Créole bean is the only tetraploid species in the genus Vigna, and it has been shown to derive from the hybridization of Vigna hirtella and Vigna trinervia. In this study, we combined the long-read PacBio technology with the chromatin contact mapping (Hi-C) technique to obtain a chromosome-level assembly of V. reflexo-pilosa. The final assembly contained 998,724,903 bases with an N50 length of 42,545,650 bases. Our gene prediction recovered 99.4% of the highly conserved orthologs based on the BUSCO analysis. To investigate homoeolog expression bias and expression level dominance in the tetraploid, we also sequenced and assembled the genomes of its progenitors. Overall, the majority of the homoeolog pairs (72.9%) displayed no expression bias, and among those that exhibited biased expression, 16.3% showed unbalanced homoeolog expression bias toward the V. trinervia subgenome. Moreover, 41.2% and 36.2% of the expressed gene pairs exhibited transgressive expression and expression level dominance, respectively. Interestingly, the genome-wide expression level dominance in the tetraploid was biased toward the V. trinervia subgenome. The analysis of methylation patterns also revealed that the average methylation levels in coding regions were higher in the V. hirtella subgenome than those in the V. trinervia subgenome. The genomic/transcriptomic resources for these three species are useful not only for the development of elite cultivars in Vigna breeding programs but also to researchers studying comparative genomics and investigating genomic/epigenomic changes following polyploid events.© The Author(s) 2023.

"37470040","Impact of Plasmodium falciparum infection on DNA methylation of circulating immune cells.","Front Genet","The regulation of immune cell responses to infection is a complex process that involves various molecular mechanisms, including epigenetic regulation. DNA methylation has been shown to play central roles in regulating gene expression and modulating cell response during infection. However, the nature and extent to which DNA methylation is involved in the host immune response in human malaria remains largely unknown. Here, we present a longitudinal study investigating the temporal dynamics of genome-widein vivoDNA methylation profiles using 189 MethylationEPIC 850 K profiles from 66 children in Burkina Faso, West Africa, sampled three times: before infection, during symptomatic parasitemia, and after malaria treatment. The results revealed major changes in the DNA methylation profiles of children in response to bothPlasmodium falciparuminfection and malaria treatment, with widespread hypomethylation of CpGs upon infection (82% of 6.8 K differentially methylated regions). We document a remarkable reversal of CpG methylation profiles upon treatment to pre-infection states. These changes implicate divergence in core immune processes, including the regulation of lymphocyte, neutrophil, and myeloid leukocyte function. Integrative DNA methylation-mRNA analysis of a top differentially methylated region overlapping the pro-inflammatory gene TNF implicates DNA methylation of TNFcisregulatory elements in the molecular mechanisms of TNF regulation in human malaria. Our results highlight a central role of epigenetic regulation in mounting the host immune response toP. falciparuminfection and in response to malaria treatment.Copyright © 2023 Almojil, Diawara, Soulama, Dieng, Manikandan, Sermé, Sombié, Diarra, Barry, Coulibaly, Sirima and Idaghdour."
"37469193","DNA methylation at birth and lateral ventricular volume in childhood: a neuroimaging epigenetics study.","J Child Psychol Psychiatry","Lateral ventricular volume (LVV) enlargement has been repeatedly linked to schizophrenia; yet, what biological factors shape LVV during early development remain unclear. DNA methylation (DNAm), an essential process for neurodevelopment that is altered in schizophrenia, is a key molecular system of interest.In this study, we conducted the first epigenome-wide association study of neonatal DNAm in cord blood with LVV in childhood (measured using T1-weighted brain scans at 10 years), based on data from a large population-based birth cohort, the Generation R Study (N = 840). Employing both probe-level and methylation profile score (MPS) approaches, we further examined whether epigenetic modifications identified at birth in cord blood are: (a) also observed cross-sectionally in childhood using peripheral blood DNAm at age of 10 years (Generation R, N = 370) and (b) prospectively associated with LVV measured in young adulthood in an all-male sample from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC, N = 114).At birth, DNAm levels at four CpGs (annotated to potassium channel tetramerization domain containing 3, KCTD3; SHH signaling and ciliogenesis regulator, SDCCAG8; glutaredoxin, GLRX) prospectively associated with childhood LVV after genome-wide correction; these genes have been implicated in brain development and psychiatric traits including schizophrenia. An MPS capturing a broader epigenetic profile of LVV - but not individual top hits - showed significant cross-sectional associations with LVV in childhood in Generation R and prospectively associated with LVV in early adulthood within ALSPAC.This study finds suggestive evidence that DNAm at birth prospectively associates with LVV at different life stages, albeit with small effect sizes. The prediction of MPS on LVV in a childhood sample and an independent male adult sample further underscores the stability and reproducibility of DNAm as a potential marker for LVV. Future studies with larger samples and comparable time points across development are needed to further elucidate how DNAm associates with this clinically relevant brain structure and risk for neuropsychiatric disorders, and what factors explain the identified DNAm profile of LVV at birth.© 2023 The Authors.

Hyperhomocysteinemia can change the methylation status of global DNA and specific genes. In the present study, we aim to examine the comprehensive influence of Hcy levels on DNA methylation status in patients with hypertension.Epigenome-wide methylation profiles of the peripheral leukocyte DNA of 218 patients with hypertension were analyzed using the Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip. Differentially methylated positions (DMPs) associated with serum Hcy levels were identified by mixed linear regression with the adjustment of potential confounders. Gene Ontology analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis were conducted to determine the potential functions of the identified DMPs. The association between the methylation level of DMPs and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (Cf-PWV) was also analyzed.Five DMPs at cg13169662, cg03179312, cg21976560, cg25262698, and cg09433843 showed significant association with serum Hcy levels (false discovery rate-corrected P < 0.05). An additional six CpG sites met the threshold for suggestive significance (P < 1 × 10-6), among which three DMPs (cg25781123, cg26463106, and cg06679221) were annotated to THUMPD3. Furthermore, the methylation levels of cg13169662 and cg25262698 (RPRD1A) were significantly associated with Cf-PWV.Our results suggest that Hcy could induce DNA methylation alteration in patients with hypertension.

"37466235","Do not be scared of the genome's 5th base-Explaining phenotypic variability and evolutionary dynamics through DNA methylation analysis.","Mol Ecol Resour","Epigenetic processes have taken center stage for the investigation of many biological processes, and epigenetic modifications have shown to influence phenotype, morphology and behavioural traits such as stress resistance by affecting gene regulation and expression without altering the underlying genomic sequence. The multiple molecular layers of epigenetics synergistically construct the cell type-specific gene regulatory networks, characterized by a high degree of plasticity and redundancy to create cell-type-specific morphology and function. DNA methylation occurring on the 5' carbon of cytosines in different genomic sequence contexts is the most studied epigenetic modification. DNA methylation has been shown to provide a molecular record of the exposure to a large variety of environmental factors, which might be persistent through the entire lifetime of an organism and even be passed onto the offspring. Animals might display altered phenotypes mediated by epigenetic modifications depending on the developmental stage or the environmental conditions as well as during evolution. Therefore, the analysis of DNA methylation patterns might allow deciphering previous exposures, explaining ecologically relevant phenotypic diversity and predicting evolutionary trajectories enabling accelerated adaption to changing environmental conditions. Despite the explanatory potential of DNA methylation integrating genetic and environmental factors to shape phenotypic variation and contribute significantly to evolutionary dynamics, studies of DNA methylation are still scarce in the field of ecology. This might be at least partly due to the complexity of DNA methylation analysis and the interpretation of the acquired data. In the current issue of Molecular Ecology Resources, Laine and colleagues (Molecular Ecology Resources, 2022) provide a detailed summary of guidelines and valuable recommendations for researchers in the field of ecology to avoid common pitfalls and perform interpretable genome-wide DNA methylation analyses.© 2023 The Author.

DNA methylation levels were compared by periodontal disease severity and edentulism through discovery analyses and subsequent testing of individual CpGs.Our discovery analysis replicated findings from a previous study reporting a region in gene ZFP57 (6p22.1) that was significantly hypomethylated in severe periodontal disease compared with no/mild periodontal disease in European American participants. Higher methylation levels in a separate region in an unknown gene (located in Chr10: 743,992-744,958) was associated with significantly higher odds of edentulism compared with no/mild periodontal disease in African American participants. In subsequent CpG testing, four CpGs in a region previously associated with periodontitis located within HOXA4 were significantly hypermethylated in severe periodontal disease compared with no/mild periodontal disease in African American participants (odds ratio per 1 SD increase in methylation level: cg11015251: 1.28 (1.02, 1.61); cg14359292: 1.24 (1.01, 1.54); cg07317062: 1.30 (1.05, 1.61); cg08657492: 1.25 (1.01, 1.55)).Our study highlights epigenetic variations in ZPF57 and HOXA4 that are significantly and reproducibly associated with periodontitis.

"37463128","PREDICTION OF PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS IN PATIENTS WITH PSORIASIS USING DNA METHYLATION PROFILES.","Arthritis Rheumatol","Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is an immune-mediated inflammatory arthritis, associated with psoriasis, that significantly increases morbidity and mortality risk. We currently lack the means of predicting which psoriasis patients will develop PsA, and a large number of patients remain undiagnosed. Regulation of gene expression through DNA methylation can potentially trigger and maintain PsA pathophysiological processes. We aimed to identify DNA methylation markers that can predict which psoriasis patients will develop PsA prior to the onset of musculoskeletal symptoms.Genome-wide DNA methylation was assessed in blood samples from psoriasis patients that went on to develop arthritis (converters) and psoriasis patients that did not (biologic naive, matched for age, sex, psoriasis duration and duration of follow up). Methylation differences between converters and non-converters were identified by a multi-variate linear regression model including clinical covariates (age, sex, BMI, smoking). Predictive performance of methylation markers was assessed by developing support vector machine classification models with and without the addition of clinical variables.We identified a set of 36 highly relevant methylation markers (FDR-adjusted p-values lower than 0.05 and a minimum change in methylation of 0.05) across 15 genes and several intergenic regions. A classification model relying on these markers identified converters and non-converters with an area under the ROC curve of 0.9644.This study shows that DNA methylation patterns at an early stage of psoriatic disease can distinguish between patients that will develop PsA from those that will not during the same follow-up.

"37461726","Critical evaluation of the reliability of DNA methylation probes on the Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip microarrays for dementia research.","Res Sq","Background DNA methylation (DNAm) has been implicated in many diseases including dementia. Array-based technologies offer a cost-effective and comprehensive approach for measuring DNAm on a genome-wide scale. However, the accuracy of DNAm measurements obtained using Illumina arrays can vary across different probes. Previous research has focused primarily on assessing the reliability of DNAm in younger subjects, and have compared duplicate samples between the 450k-450k or 450k-EPIC platforms, with limited investigations on EPIC-EPIC comparisons. Methods We conducted a comprehensive assessment of probe reliability on the Illumina EPIC arrays using 138 duplicated blood DNAm samples from subjects older than 65 years in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. To assess the reliability of each probe, we computed intraclass correlations (ICCs) for each probe. Both the magnitude and patterns of reliability in the EPIC-EPIC comparison were assessed. Furthermore, we also investigated the impact of probe reliability on the analyses of epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS). Results Our findings revealed the reliability of probes on the EPIC arrays is higher than those of previous studies involving duplicate measurements on 450k-EPIC or 450k-450k arrays. Consistent with earlier research, we observed increased reliability in probes with substantial between-subject variances or average methylation beta values ranging from 0.2 to 0.8. Lower reliability was observed in type I probes or probes located within the promoter and CpG island regions. In addition, we found some probes can yield high ICC values despite significant disagreement in duplicate measurements, primarily due to their relatively high between-subject variance. To account for such discrepancies explicitly, we introduced a novel statistical measure called the modified ICC, which penalizes the ICC based on the half-width of the 95% confidence limits of agreement. Importantly, we found probe reliability has significant implications in various downstream analyses of EWAS, such as meta-analysis, differentially methylated regions analysis, and integrative analyses within the cross-tissue or multi-omics contexts. Conclusion We developed a valuable resource for dementia research, providing crucial reliability information for probes on the EPIC array. This resource can be utilized to identify and prioritize high-quality probes, thereby minimizing the potential for false discoveries and maximizing the potential of EWAS."
"37461718","Histone deacetylation and cytosine methylation compartmentalize heterochromatic regions in the genome organization of Neurospora crassa.","bioRxiv","Chromosomes must correctly fold in eukaryotic nuclei for proper genome function. Eukaryotic organisms hierarchically organize their genomes: in the fungusNeurospora crassa, chromatin fiber loops compact into Topologically Associated Domain (TAD)-like structures that are anchored by the aggregation of silent heterochromatic regions. However, insufficient information exists on how histone post-translational modifications, including acetylation, impact genome organization. In Neurospora, the HCHC complex (comprised of the proteins HDA-1, CDP-2, HP1, and CHAP) deacetylates heterochromatic regions, including centromeres: loss of individual HCHC members increases centromeric acetylation and alters cytosine methylation. Here, we evaluate the role of the HCHC complex on genome organization using chromosome conformation capture with high-throughput sequencing (Hi-C) in strains deleted of thecdp-2orchapgenes. CDP-2 loss increases interactions between intra- and inter-chromosomal heterochromatic regions, while loss of CHAP decreases heterochromatic region compaction. Individual HCHC mutants exhibit different patterns of histone post-translational modifications genome-wide: without CDP-2, heterochromatic H4K16 acetylation is increased, yet some heterochromatic regions lose H3K9 trimethylation, which increases interactions between heterochromatic regions; CHAP loss produces minimal acetylation changes but increases heterochromatic H3K9me3 enrichment. Interestingly, loss of both CDP-2 and the DIM-2 DNA methyltransferase causes extensive genome disorder, as heterochromatic-euchromatic contacts increase despite additional levels of H3K9me3. Our results highlight how the increased cytosine methylation in HCHC mutants ensures heterochromatic compartmentalization when silenced regions become hyperacetylated with loss of HDAC activity.The mechanisms driving chromosome organization in eukaryotic nuclei, including in the filamentous fungusNeurospora crassa, are currently unknown, but histone post-translational modifications may be involved. Histone proteins can be acetylated to form active euchromatin while histone deacetylases (HDACs) remove acetyl marks to form silent heterochromatin; heterochromatic regions cluster and strongly interact in Neurospora genome organization. Here, we show that mutants lacking components of a heterochromatin-specific HDAC (HCHC) causes histone acetylation gains in heterochromatin genome-wide and contact increases between distant heterochromatic loci. HCHC loss also impacts cytosine methylation, and in strains lacking both the HCHC and cytosine methylation, heterochromatic regions interact more with euchromatin. Our results suggest cytosine methylation normally functions to segregate silent and active loci when heterochromatic acetylation increases."
"37461679","The application of epiphenotyping approaches to DNA methylation array studies of the human placenta.","Res Sq","Background: Genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAme) profiling of the placenta with Illumina Infinium Methylation bead arrays is often used to explore the connections betweenin uteroexposures, placental pathology, and fetal development. However, many technical and biological factors can lead to signals of DNAme variation between samples and between cohorts, and understanding and accounting for these factors is essential to ensure meaningful and replicable data analysis. Recently, ""epiphenotyping"" approaches have been developed whereby DNAme data can be used to impute information about phenotypic variables such as gestational age, sex, cell composition, and ancestry. These epiphenotypes offer avenues to compare phenotypic data across cohorts, and to understand how phenotypic variables relate to DNAme variability. However, the relationships between placental epiphenotyping variables and other technical and biological variables, and their application to downstream epigenome analyses, have not been well studied.Results: Using DNAme data from 204 placentas across three cohorts, we applied the PlaNET R package to estimate epiphenotypes gestational age, ancestry, and cell composition in these samples. PlaNET ancestry estimates were highly correlated with independent polymorphic ancestry informative markers, and epigenetic gestational age, on average, was estimated within 4 days of reported gestational age, underscoring the accuracy of these tools. Cell composition estimates varied both within and between cohorts, but reassuringly were robust to placental processing time. Interestingly, the ratio of cytotrophoblast to syncytiotrophoblast proportion decreased with increasing gestational age, and differed slightly by both maternal ethnicity (lower in white vs. non-white) and genetic ancestry (lower in higher probability European ancestry). The cohort of origin and cytotrophoblast proportion were the largest drivers of DNAme variation in this dataset, based on their associations with the first principal component.Conclusions: This work confirms that cohort, array (technical) batch, cell type proportion, self-reported ethnicity, genetic ancestry, and biological sex are important variables to consider in any analyses of Illumina DNAme data. Further, we demonstrate that estimating epiphenotype variables from the DNAme data itself, when possible, provides both an independent check of clinically-obtained data and can provide a robust approach to compare variables across different datasets."

We conducted a genome-wide DNA methylation analysis to detect DNA methylation (DNAm) variants potentially related to FPG in Chinese monozygotic twins.Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling in whole blood of twins was performed using Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS), yielding 551,447 raw CpGs. Association between DNAm of single CpG and FPG was tested using a generalized estimation equation. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified using comb-P approach. ICE FALCON method was utilized to perform the causal inference. Candidate CpGs were quantified and validated using Sequenom MassARRAY platform in a community population. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was conducted using gene expression data from twins.The mean age of 52 twin pairs was 52 years (SD: 7). The relationship between DNAm of 142 CpGs and FPG reached the genome-wide significance level. Thirty-two DMRs within 24 genes were identified, including TLCD1, MRPS31P5, CASZ1, and CXADRP3. The causal relationship of top CpGs mapped to TLCD1, MZF1, PTPRN2, SLC6A18, ASTN2, IQCA1, GRIN1, and PDE2A genes with FPG were further identified using ICE FALCON method. Pathways potentially related to FPG were also identified, such as phospholipid-hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase activity and mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 binding. Three CpGs mapped to SLC6A18 gene were validated in a community population, with a hypermethylated direction in diabetic patients. The expression levels of 18 genes (including SLC6A18 and TLCD1) were positively correlated with FPG levels.We detect many DNAm variants that may be associated with FPG in whole blood, particularly the loci within SLC6A18 gene. Our findings provide important reference for the epigenetic regulation of elevated FPG levels and diabetes.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Understanding how the archetypic epigenetic modification determines systemic contributions of immune cell types is the key to further clinical benefits.In this study, we characterized the differential DNA methylome landscapes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 76 canines using methylated CpG-binding domain sequencing (MBD-seq). Through gene set enrichment analysis, we discovered that genes involved in the growth and differentiation of T- and B-cells are highly methylated in tumor PBMCs. We also revealed the increased methylation at single CpG resolution and reversed expression in representative marker genes regulating immune cell proliferation (BACH2, SH2D1A, TXK, UHRF1). Furthermore, we utilized the PBMC methylome to effectively differentiate between benign and malignant tumors and the presence of mammary gland tumors through a machine-learning approach.This research contributes to a better knowledge of the comprehensive epigenetic regulation of circulating immune cells responding to tumors and suggests a new framework for identifying benign and malignant cancers using genome-wide methylome.© 2023.

Yet there is a lack of systematic identification of chromatin crosstalk mechanisms, limiting our understanding of the dynamic transition between chromatin states during development and disease. Here we perform co-dependency mapping of genes using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated fitness screens in pan-cancer cell lines to quantify gene-gene functional relationships. We identify 145 co-dependency modules and further define the molecular context underlying the essentiality of these modules by incorporating mutational, epigenome, gene expression and drug sensitivity profiles of cell lines. These analyses assign new protein complex composition and function, and predict new functional interactions, including an unexpected co-dependency between two transcriptionally counteracting chromatin complexes - polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and MLL-MEN1 complex. We show that PRC2-mediated H3K27 tri-methylation regulates the genome-wide distribution of MLL1 and MEN1. In lymphoma cells with EZH2 gain-of-function mutations, the re-localization of MLL-MEN1 complex drives oncogenic gene expression and results in a hypersensitivity to pharmacologic inhibition of MEN1. Together, our findings provide a resource for discovery of trans-regulatory interactions as mechanisms of chromatin regulation and potential targets of synthetic lethality.© 2023. The Author(s)."

To investigated whether alterations in DNA methylation is involved in this process, the level of genome-wide DNA methylation in Takifugu rubripes gonads was quantitatively analyzed during the E2-induced feminization and AI-induced masculinization processes in this study. The methylation levels of the total cytosine (C) in control-XX(C-XX), control-XY (C-XY), E2-treated-XY (E-XY) and AI-treated-XX (AI-XX) were 9.11%, 9.19%, 8.63% and 9.23%, respectively. In the C-XX vs C-XY comparison, 4,196 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) overlapped with the gene body of 2,497 genes and 608 DMRs overlapped with the promoter of 575 genes. In the E-XY vs C-XY comparison, 6,539 DMRs overlapped with the gene body of 3,416 genes and 856 DMRs overlapped with the promoter of 776 genes. In the AI-XX vs C-XX comparison, 2,843 DMRs overlapped with the gene body of 1,831 genes and 461 DMRs overlapped with the promoter of 421 genes. Gonadal genomic methylation mainly occurred at CG sites and the genes that overlapped with DMRs on CG context were most enriched in the signaling pathways related to gonad differentiation, such as the Wnt, TGF-β, MAPK, CAM and GnRH pathways. The DNA methylation levels of steroid synthesis genes and estrogen receptor genes promoter or gene body were negative correlated with their expression. After bisulfite sequencing verification, the DNA methylation level of the amhr2 promoter in XY was increased after E2treatment, which consistent with the data from the genome-wide DNA methylation sequencing. In C-XY group, the expression of amhr2 was significantly higher than that in E-XY (p < 0.05). Additionally, dnmt1, which is responsible for methylation maintenance, expressed at similar level in four groups (p > 0.05). dnmt3, tet2, and setd1b, which were responsible for methylation modification, expressed at significantly higher levels in E-XY compared to the C-XY (p < 0.05). Dnmt3 and tet2 were expressed at significantly higher levels in AI-XX than that in C-XX (p < 0.05). These results indicated that E2and AI treatment lead to the aberrant genome-wide DNA methylation level and expression level of dnmt3, tet2, and setd1b in T. rubripes gonad.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this study is to comprehensively map the landscape of the mRNA m6A modification pattern in Barrett's esophagus (BE) in order to find key genes and potential therapy for BE and even esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC).Methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq) and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) were performed to compare the difference in mRNA m6A methylation and differentially expressed mRNAs between BE and normal control (NC) tissues. Bioinformatics analysis was used to describe the m6A modification pattern and specific genes in BE and NC tissues.Through MeRIP-seq, we obtained m6A methylation profiling in BE and NC tissues. In total, 11,026 unique peaks were detected in the BE groups, whereas 8564 unique peaks were detected in the NC groups. Peaks were primarily enriched within CDS with GGACU motifs and most of the peaks were within 1000 bp in width. Moreover, functional enrichment analysis demonstrated that hypermethylated and hypomethylated genes were significantly enriched in coronavirus disease pathway, calcium signaling pathway and MAPK signaling pathways. Furthermore, PPI network was conducted and 18 hub genes were identified via STRING database and Cystoscope. Among them, ACTA1, CDC20, CKM, KIF20a, MYH11, TPM2, MYL9, DES, TNNT3 were overexpressed in EAC in the GEPIA gene bank and TPM1, KIF20a impaired patients' survival in the Kaplan-Meier plotter database. Finally, functional enrichment analysis demonstrated that co-expressed genes of TPM1 were significantly enriched in calcium signaling pathway, cGMP-PKG signaling pathway and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway.Our study is the first to perform comprehensive and transcriptome-wide maps to identify the potential roles played by m6A methylation in BE, which widely involved in oxidative stress. This foresees a guiding role in revealing the molecular mechanism of m6A-mediated genes that govern the pathogenesis and progression of BE and EAC.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

We conducted our study on a European population with 159,208 neuroticism and 289,142 birth weight samples. In this study, we aimed to identify new neuroticism single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and pleiotropic SNPs associated with neuroticism and BW and to provide more theoretical basis for the pathogenesis of the disease.We estimated the pleiotropic enrichment between neuroticism and BW in two independent Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) when the statistical thresholds were Conditional False Discovery Rate (cFDR) < 0.01 and Conjunctional Conditional False Discovery Rate (ccFDR) < 0.05. We performed gene annotation and gene functional analysis on the selected significant SNPs to determine the biological role of gene function and pathogenesis. Two-sample Mendelian Randomization (TSMR) analysis was performed to explore the causal relationship between the neuroticism and BW.The conditional quantile-quantile plots (Q-Q plot) indicated that neuroticism and BW have strong genetic pleiotropy enrichment trends. With the threshold of cFDR < 0.001, we identified 126 SNPs related to neuroticism and 172 SNPs related to BW. With the threshold of ccFDR < 0.05, we identified 62 SNPs related to both neuroticism and BW. Among these SNPs, rs8039305 and rs35755513 have eQTL (expressed quantitative trait loci) and meQTL (methylation quantitative trait loci) effects simultaneously. Through GO enrichment analysis we also found that the two pathways of positive regulation of ""mesenchymal cell proliferation"" and ""DNA-binding transcription factor activity"" were significantly enriched in neuroticism and BW.

We adapted a recently developed method for inferring somatic mutations from bulk RNA-seq data and applied it to a large collection of Arabidopsis thaliana accessions. The wide range of genomic data types available for A. thaliana enabled us to investigate the relationships of multiple genomic features with the variation in the somatic mutation rate across the genome of this model plant. We observed that late replicated regions showed evidence of an elevated rate of somatic mutation compared to genomic regions that are replicated early. We identified transcriptional strand asymmetries, consistent with the effects of transcription-coupled damage and/or repair. We also observed a negative relationship between the inferred somatic mutation count and the H3K36me3 histone mark which is well-documented in the literature of human systems. In addition, we were able to support previous reports of an inverse relationship between inferred somatic mutation count and GC content as well as a positive relationship between inferred somatic mutation count and DNA methylation for both cytosine and non-cytosine mutations.© The Author(s) 2023.

We conducted two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses respectively on smoking behaviors (age of smoking initiation, smoking initiation, smoking cessation, and lifetime smoking index [LSI]) and smoking-related DNA methylation to investigate their effect on 15 site-specific cancers, based on a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 1.2 million European individuals and an epigenome-WAS (EWAS) of 5907 blood samples of Europeans for smoking and 15 GWASs of European ancestry for multiple site-specific cancers. Significantly identified CpG sites were further used for colocalization analysis, and those with cross-cancer effect were validated by overlapping with tissue-specific eQTLs. In the genomic MR, smoking measurements of smoking initiation, smoking cessation and LSI were suggested to be casually associated with risk of seven types of site-specific cancers, among which cancers at lung, cervix and colorectum were provided with strong evidence. In the epigenetic MR, methylation at 75 CpG sites were reported to be significantly associated with increased risks of multiple cancers. Eight out of 75 CpG sites were observed with cross-cancer effect, among which cg06639488 (EFNA1), cg12101586 (CYP1A1) and cg14142171 (HLA-L) were validated by eQTLs at specific cancer sites, and cg07932199 (ATXN2) had strong evidence to be associated with cancers of lung (coefficient, 0.65, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31-1.00), colorectum (0.90 [0.61, 1.18]), breast (0.31 [0.20, 0.43]) and endometrium (0.98 [0.68, 1.27]).

It shows a highly malignant behavior and devastating outcomes. To date, there is still no targeted therapy available; thus, patients' median survival is limited to 12-15 months. Epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an interesting targetable candidate in advanced precision medicine for brain tumor patients. In this study, we performed integrated epigenome-wide DNA-methylation profiling of 866,895 methylation specific sites in 50 glioblastoma IDH wildtype samples, comparingEGFRamplified and non-amplified glioblastomas. We found 9849 significantly differentially methylated CpGs (DMCGs) with Δβ ≥ 0.1 andp-value < 0.05 inEGFRamplified, compared toEGFRnon-amplified glioblastomas. Of these DMCGs, 2380 were annotated with tiling (2090), promoter (117), gene (69) and CpG islands (104); 7460 are located at other loci. Interestingly, the list of differentially methylated genes allocated eleven functionally relevant RNAs: five miRNAs (miR1180, miR1255B1, miR126, miR128-2, miR3125), two long non-coding RNAs (LINC00474, LINC01091), and four antisense RNAs (EPN2-AS1, MNX1-AS2, NKX2-2-AS1, WWTR1-AS1). Gene ontology (GO) analysis showed enrichment of ""DNA replication-dependent nucleosome assembly"", ""chromatin silencing at rDNA"", ""regulation of gene silencing by miRNA"", ""DNA packaging"", ""posttranscriptional gene silencing"", ""gene silencing by RNA"", ""negative regulation of gene expression, epigenetic"", ""regulation of gene silencing"", ""protein-DNA complex subunit organization"", and ""DNA replication-independent nucleosome organization"" pathways being hypomethylated inEGFRamplified glioblastomas. In summary, dissecting the methylomes ofEGFRamplified and non-amplified glioblastomas revealed altered DNA replication, DNA packaging, chromatin silencing and gene silencing pathways, opening potential novel targets for future precision medicine."

We investigated the mechanism through which rs17514846 modulatesFURINexpression. An analysis of isogenic monocytic cell lines showed that the cells of the rs17514846 A/A genotype expressed higher levels ofFURINthan cells of the C/C genotype. Pyrosequencing showed that the cytosine (in a CpG motif) at the rs17514846 position on the C allele was methylated. Treatment with the DNA methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine increasedFURINexpression. An electrophoretic mobility super-shift assay with a probe corresponding to the DNA sequence at and around the rs17514846 position of the C allele detected DNA-protein complex bands that were altered by an anti-MeCP2 antibody. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay with the anti-MeCP2 antibody showed an enrichment of the DNA sequence containing the rs17514846 site. siRNA-mediated knockdown of MeCP2 caused an increase in FURIN expression. Furthermore, MeCP2 knockdown increased monocyte migration and proliferation, and this effect was diminished by a FURIN inhibitor. The results of our study suggest that DNA methylation inhibitsFURINexpression and that the coronary artery disease-predisposing variant rs17514846 modulatesFURINexpression and monocyte migration via an allele-specific effect on DNA methylation."
"37443311","Methyl-CpG binding domain 2 (Mbd2) is an epigenetic regulator of autism-risk genes and cognition.","Transl Psychiatry","The Methyl-CpG-Binding Domain Protein family has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. The Methyl-CpG-binding domain 2 (Mbd2) binds methylated DNA and was shown to play an important role in cancer and immunity. Some evidence linked this protein to neurodevelopment. However, its exact role in neurodevelopment and brain function is mostly unknown. Here we show that Mbd2-deficiency in mice (Mbd2-/-) results in deficits in cognitive, social and emotional functions. Mbd2 binds regulatory DNA regions of neuronal genes in the hippocampus and loss of Mbd2 alters the expression of hundreds of genes with a robust down-regulation of neuronal gene pathways. Further, a genome-wide DNA methylation analysis found an altered DNA methylation pattern in regulatory DNA regions of neuronal genes in Mbd2-/- mice. Differentially expressed genes significantly overlap with gene-expression changes observed in brains of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) individuals. Notably, downregulated genes are significantly enriched for human ortholog ASD risk genes. Observed hippocampal morphological abnormalities were similar to those found in individuals with ASD and ASD rodent models. Hippocampal Mbd2 knockdown partially recapitulates the behavioral phenotypes observed in Mbd2-/- mice. These findings suggest that Mbd2 is a novel epigenetic regulator of genes that are associated with ASD in humans. Mbd2 loss causes behavioral alterations that resemble those found in ASD individuals.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37441927","The association of epigenetic age acceleration and depressive and anxiety symptom severity among children recently exposed to substantiated maltreatment.","J Psychiatr Res","Child maltreatment is a major risk factor for both depressive and anxiety disorders. However, many children exposed to maltreatment never meet diagnostic threshold for either disorder while experiencing only transitory symptoms post-exposure. Recent research suggests DNA methylation adds predictive value in explaining variation in the onset and course of multiple psychiatric disorders following exposure to child maltreatment. Epigenetic age acceleration (EAA), the biological aging of cells not attributable to chronological aging, is a stress-sensitive biomarker capturing genome-wide variation in DNA methylation with the potential to identify children who have been maltreated at greatest risk for depressive and anxiety disorders. The current study examined two EAA clocks appropriate for the pediatric population, the Horvath and Pediatric Buccal Epigenetic (PedBE) clocks, and their associations with depressive and anxiety symptom severity following child maltreatment. Children (N = 71) 8-15 years of age, all of whom were exposed to substantiated child maltreatment in the 12 months prior to study entry, were enrolled. Risk modeling adjusting for several confounders revealed that EAA estimated via the Horvath clock was significantly associated with more severe depressive and anxiety symptoms. The PedBE clock was not associated with either depressive or anxiety symptom severity. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that EAA via the Horvath clock robustly predicted depressive and anxiety symptom severity across multiple modeling scenarios. Our findings advance existing research suggesting EAA, as estimated with the Horvath clock, may be a promising biomarker for identifying children at greatest risk for more severe depressive and anxiety symptoms following maltreatment.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

"37440923","One-carbon metabolism is required for epigenetic stability in the mouse placenta.","Front Cell Dev Biol","One-carbon metabolism, including the folate cycle, has a crucial role in fetal development though its molecular function is complex and unclear. The hypomorphicMtrrgtallele is known to disrupt one-carbon metabolism, and thus methyl group availability, leading to several developmental phenotypes (e.g., neural tube closure defects, fetal growth anomalies). Remarkably, previous studies showed that some of the phenotypes were transgenerationally inherited. Here, we explored the genome-wide epigenetic impact of one-carbon metabolism in placentas associated with fetal growth phenotypes and determined whether specific DNA methylation changes were inherited. Firstly, methylome analysis ofMtrrgt/gthomozygous placentas revealed genome-wide epigenetic instability. Several differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified including at theCxcl1gene promoter and at theEn2gene locus, which may have phenotypic implications. Importantly, we discovered hypomethylation and ectopic expression of a subset of ERV elements throughout the genome ofMtrrgt/gtplacentas with broad implications for genomic stability. Next, we determined that known spermatozoan DMRs inMtrrgt/gtmales were reprogrammed in the placenta with little evidence of direct or transgenerational germline DMR inheritance. However, some spermatozoan DMRs were associated with placental gene misexpression despite normalisation of DNA methylation, suggesting the inheritance of an alternative epigenetic mechanism. Integration of published wildtype histone ChIP-seq datasets withMtrrgt/gtspermatozoan methylome and placental transcriptome datasets point towards H3K4me3 deposition at key loci. These data suggest that histone modifications might play a role in epigenetic inheritance in this context. Overall, this study sheds light on the mechanistic complexities of one-carbon metabolism in development and epigenetic inheritance.Copyright © 2023 Senner, Dong, Prater, Branco and Watson."

Based on the mechanisms related to translation regulation and the association with PD-L1 of methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3), the novel small-molecule inhibitor STM2457 is assumed to be useful for the treatment of NSCLC. We evaluated the efficacy of STM2457 in vivo and in vitro and confirmed the effects of its inhibition on disease progression. Next, we explored the effect of STM2457 on METTL3 and revealed its effects on the inhibition of catalytic activity and upregulation of METTL3 protein expression. Importantly, we described the genome-wide characteristics of multiple omics data acquired from RNA sequencing, ribosome profiling, and methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing data under STM2457 treatment or METTL3 knockout. We also constructed a model for the regulation of the translation of METTL3 and PD-L1. Finally, we found PD-L1 upregulation by STM2457 in vivo and in vitro. In conclusion, STM2457 is a potential novel suppressor based on its inhibitory effect on tumor progression and may be able to overcome the heterogeneity based on its impact on the translatome. Furthermore, it can improve the immunotherapy outcomes based on PD-L1 upregulation in NSCLC.© 2023 The Author(s)."
"37440635","Control of histone demethylation by nuclear-localized Î±-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase.","Science","Methylations on nucleosomal histones play fundamental roles in regulating eukaryotic transcription. Jumonji C domain-containing histone demethylases (JMJs) dynamically control the level of histone methylations. However, how JMJ activity is generally regulated is unknown. We found that the tricarboxylic acid cycle-associated enzyme α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) dehydrogenase (KGDH) entered the nucleus, where it interacted with various JMJs to regulate α-KG-dependent histone demethylations by JMJs, and thus controlled genome-wide gene expression in plants. We show that nuclear targeting is regulated by environmental signals and that KGDH is enriched at thousands of loci inArabidopsis thaliana. Chromatin-bound KGDH catalyzes α-KG decarboxylation and thus may limit its local availability to KGDH-coupled JMJs, inhibiting histone demethylation. Thus, our results uncover a regulatory mechanism for histone demethylations by JMJs."

We have previously shown that the ectopic induction of the Yamanaka factors OCT4, SOX2, and KLF4 (OSK) in mammals can restore youthful DNA methylation patterns, transcript profiles, and tissue function, without erasing cellular identity, a process that requires active DNA demethylation. To screen for molecules that reverse cellular aging and rejuvenate human cells without altering the genome, we developed high-throughput cell-based assays that distinguish young from old and senescent cells, including transcription-based aging clocks and a real-time nucleocytoplasmic compartmentalization (NCC) assay. We identify six chemical cocktails, which, in less than a week and without compromising cellular identity, restore a youthful genome-wide transcript profile and reverse transcriptomic age. Thus, rejuvenation by age reversal can be achieved, not only by genetic, but also chemical means."

It requires a low sequencing depth to be cost effective, which may increase the error at the genotype assigment. Third generation nanopore sequencing technology offers low cost sequencing and the possibility to detect genome methylation, which provides added value to genotype-by-sequencing. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of genotype-by-low pass nanopore sequencing for estimating the direct genomic value in dairy cattle, and the possibility to obtain methylation marks simultaneously.Latest nanopore chemistry (LSK14 and Q20) achieved a modal base calling accuracy of 99.55%, whereas previous kit (LSK109) achieved slightly lower accuracy (99.1%). The direct genomic value accuracy from genotype-by-low pass sequencing ranged between 0.79 and 0.99, depending on the trait (milk, fat or protein yield), with a sequencing depth as low as 2 × and using the latest chemistry (LSK114). Lower sequencing depth led to biased estimates, yet with high rank correlations. The LSK109 and Q20 achieved lower accuracies (0.57-0.93). More than one million high reliable methylated sites were obtained, even at low sequencing depth, located mainly in distal intergenic (87%) and promoter (5%) regions.This study showed that the latest nanopore technology in useful in a LowPass sequencing framework to estimate direct genomic values with high reliability. It may provide advantages in populations with no available SNP chip, or when a large density of markers with a wide range of allele frequencies is needed. In addition, low pass sequencing provided nucleotide methylation status of > 1 million nucleotides at ≥ 10 × , which is an added value for epigenetic studies.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37434245","DNA methylation, combined with RNA sequencing, provide novel insight into molecular classification of chordomas and their microenvironment.","Acta Neuropathol Commun","Chordomas are rare tumors of notochord remnants, occurring mainly in the sacrum and skull base. Despite of their unusually slow growth, chordomas are highly invasive and the involvement of adjacent critical structures causes treatment challenges. Due to the low incidence, the molecular pathogenesis of this entity remains largely unknown. This study aimed to investigate DNA methylation abnormalities and their impact on gene expression profiles in skull base chordomas. 32 tumor and 4 normal nucleus pulposus samples were subjected to DNA methylation and gene expression profiling with methylation microarrays and RNA sequencing. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis revealed two distinct clusters for chordoma (termed subtypes C and I) with different patterns of aberrant DNA methylation. C Chordomas were characterized by general hypomethylation with hypermethylation of CpG islands, while I chordomas were generally hypermethylated. These differences were reflected by distinct distribution of differentially methylated probes (DMPs). Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified, indicating aberrant methylation in known tumor-related genes in booth chordoma subtypes and regions encoding small RNAs in subtype C chordomas. Correlation between methylation and expression was observed in a minority of genes. Upregulation of TBXT in chordomas appeared to be related to lower methylation of tumor-specific DMR in gene promoter. Gene expression-based clusters of tumor samples did not overlap with DNA methylation-based subtypes. Nevertheless, they differ in transcriptomic profile that shows immune infiltration in I chordomas and up-regulation of cell cycle in C chordomas. Immune enrichment in chordomas I was confirmed with 3 independent deconvolution methods and immunohistochemistry. Copy number analysis showed higher chromosomal instability in C chordomas. Nine out of eight had deletion of CDKN2A/B loci and downregulation of genes encoded in related chromosomal band. No significant difference in patients' survival was observed between tumor subtypes, however, shorter survival was observed in patients with higher number of copy number alterations.© 2023.

The objective of this study was to modify the read alignment algorithm associated with the whole-genome bisulfite sequencing methylation analysis pipeline (wg-blimp) to shorten the time required to complete this phase while retaining overall read alignment accuracy. Here, we report an update to the recently published pipeline wg-blimp achieved by replacing the use of the bwa-meth aligner with the faster gemBS aligner. This improvement to the wg-blimp pipeline has led to a more than ×7 acceleration in the processing speed of samples when scaled to larger publicly available FASTQ datasets containing 80-160 million reads while maintaining nearly identical accuracy of properly mapped reads when compared with data from the previous pipeline. The modifications to the wg-blimp pipeline reported here merge the speed and accuracy of the gemBS aligner with the comprehensive analysis and data visualization assets of the wg-blimp pipeline to provide a significantly accelerated workflow that can produce high-quality data much more rapidly without compromising read accuracy at the expense of increasing RAM requirements up to 48 GB.© The Author(s) 2023.

Basic Protocol 1 focuses on characterizing murine iNKT subsets ex vivo by flow cytometry by evaluating the expression of lineage-specifying transcription factors such as PLZF and RORγt. The Alternate Protocol describes a detailed approach to define subsets based on expression of surface markers. This approach can be very useful for maintaining the subsets alive, without fixing them, in order to isolate them for downstream molecular assays such as DNA/RNA isolation, genome-wide analysis to assess gene expression (such as RNA-seq), assessment of chromatin accessibility (for instance, by ATAC-seq), and assessment of DNA methylation by whole-genome bisulfite sequencing. Basic Protocol 2 describes the functional characterization of iNKT cells, which are activated in vitro with PMA and ionomycin for a short period of time and subsequently stained and characterized for production of cytokines, such as IFNγ and IL-4, by flow cytometry. Basic Protocol 3 describes the process of activating iNKT cells in vivo using α-galactosyl-ceramide, a lipid that can be recognized specifically by iNKT cells, allowing assessment of their functionality in vivo.

"37425067","Hedgehog pathway orchestrates the interplay of histone modifications and tailors combination epigenetic therapies in breast cancer.","Acta Pharm Sin B","Epigenetic therapies that cause genome-wide epigenetic alterations, could trigger local interplay between different histone marks, leading to a switch of transcriptional outcome and therapeutic responses of epigenetic treatment. However, in human cancers with diverse oncogenic activation, how oncogenic pathways cooperate with epigenetic modifiers to regulate the histone mark interplay is poorly understood. We herein discover that the hedgehog (Hh) pathway reprograms the histone methylation landscape in breast cancer, especially in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). This facilitates the histone acetylation caused by histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors and gives rise to new therapeutic vulnerability of combination therapies. Specifically, overexpression of zinc finger protein of the cerebellum 1 (ZIC1) in breast cancer promotes Hh activation, facilitating the switch of H3K27 methylation (H3K27me) to acetylation (H3K27ac). The mutually exclusive relationship of H3K27me and H3K27ac allows their functional interplay at oncogenic gene locus and switches therapeutic outcomes. Using multiplein vivobreast cancer models including patient-derived TNBC xenograft, we show that Hh signaling-orchestrated H3K27me and H3K27ac interplay tailors combination epigenetic drugs in treating breast cancer. Together, this study reveals the new role of Hh signaling-regulated histone modifications interplay in responding to HDAC inhibitors and suggests new epigenetically-targeted therapeutic solutions for treating TNBC.© 2023 Chinese Pharmaceutical Association and Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

"37420295","Genome-wide DNA methylation and transcriptome analyses reveal the key gene for wool type variation in sheep.","J Anim Sci Biotechnol","Wool fibers are valuable materials for textile industry. Typical wool fibers are divided into medullated and non-medullated types, with the former generated from primary wool follicles and the latter by either primary or secondary wool follicles. The medullated wool is a common wool type in the ancestors of fine wool sheep before breeding. The fine wool sheep have a non-medullated coat. However, the critical period determining the type of wool follicles is the embryonic stage, which limits the phenotypic observation and variant contrast, making both selection and studies of wool type variation fairly difficult.During the breeding of a modern fine (MF) wool sheep population with multiple-ovulation and embryo transfer technique, we serendipitously discovered lambs with ancestral-like coarse (ALC) wool. Whole-genome resequencing confirmed ALC wool lambs as a variant type from the MF wool population. We mapped the significantly associated methylation locus on chromosome 4 by using whole genome bisulfite sequencing signals, and in turn identified the SOSTDC1 gene as exons hypermethylated in ALC wool lambs compare to their half/full sibling MF wool lambs. Transcriptome sequencing found that SOSTDC1 was expressed dozens of times more in ALC wool lamb skin than that of MF and was at the top of all differentially expressed genes. An analogy with the transcriptome of coarse/fine wool breeds revealed that differentially expressed genes and enriched pathways at postnatal lamb stage in ALC/MF were highly similar to those at the embryonic stage in the former. Further experiments validated that the SOSTDC1 gene was specifically highly expressed in the nucleus of the dermal papilla of primary wool follicles.In this study, we conducted genome-wide differential methylation site association analysis on differential wool type trait, and located the only CpG locus that strongly associated with primary wool follicle development. Combined with transcriptome analysis, SOSTDC1 was identified as the only gene at this locus that was specifically overexpressed in the primary wool follicle stem cells of ALC wool lamb skin. The discovery of this key gene and its epigenetic regulation contributes to understanding the domestication and breeding of fine wool sheep.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37420260","Phenotypic variability to medication management: an update on fragile X syndrome.","Hum Genomics","This review discusses the discovery, epidemiology, pathophysiology, genetic etiology, molecular diagnosis, and medication-based management of fragile X syndrome (FXS). It also highlights the syndrome's variable expressivity and common comorbid and overlapping conditions. FXS is an X-linked dominant disorder associated with a wide spectrum of clinical features, including but not limited to intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, language deficits, macroorchidism, seizures, and anxiety. Its prevalence in the general population is approximately 1 in 5000-7000 men and 1 in 4000-6000 women worldwide. FXS is associated with the fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1) gene located at locus Xq27.3 and encodes the fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein (FMRP). Most individuals with FXS have an FMR1 allele with > 200 CGG repeats (full mutation) and hypermethylation of the CpG island proximal to the repeats, which silences the gene's promoter. Some individuals have mosaicism in the size of the CGG repeats or in hypermethylation of the CpG island, both produce some FMRP and give rise to milder cognitive and behavioral deficits than in non-mosaic individuals with FXS. As in several monogenic disorders, modifier genes influence the penetrance of FMR1 mutations and FXS's variable expressivity by regulating the pathophysiological mechanisms related to the syndrome's behavioral features. Although there is no cure for FXS, prenatal molecular diagnostic testing is recommended to facilitate early diagnosis. Pharmacologic agents can reduce some behavioral features of FXS, and researchers are investigating whether gene editing can be used to demethylate the FMR1 promoter region to improve patient outcomes. Moreover, clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 and developed nuclease defective Cas9 (dCas9) strategies have promised options of genome editing in gain-of-function mutations to rewrite new genetic information into a specified DNA site, are also being studied.© 2023.

"37417299","Integrated analysis of DNA methylome and transcriptome reveals SFRP1 and LIPG as potential drivers of ovarian cancer metastasis.","J Gynecol Oncol","More than 75% of ovarian cancer patients are diagnosed at advanced stages and die of tumor cell metastasis. This study aimed to identify new epigenetic and transcriptomic alterations associated with ovarian cancer metastasis.Two cell sublines with low- and high-metastasis potentials were derived from the ovarian cancer cell line A2780. Genome-wide DNA methylome and transcriptome profiling were carried out in these two sublines by Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing and RNA-seq technologies. Cell-based assays were conducted to support the clinical findings.There are distinct DNA methylation and gene expression patterns between the two cell sublines with low- and high-metastasis potentials. Integrated analysis identified 33 methylation-induced genes potentially involved in ovarian cancer metastasis. The DNA methylation patterns of two of them (i.e., SFRP1 and LIPG) were further validated in human specimens, indicating that they were hypermethylated and downregulated in peritoneal metastatic ovarian carcinoma compared to primary ovarian carcinoma. Patients with lower SFRP1 and LIPG expression tend to have a worse prognosis. Functionally, knockdown of SFRP1 and LIPG promoted cell growth and migration, whereas their overexpression resulted in the opposite effects. In particular, knockdown of SFRP1 could phosphorylate GSK3β and increase β-catenin expression, leading to deregulated activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling.Many systemic and important epigenetic and transcriptomic alterations occur in the progression of ovarian cancer. In particular, epigenetic silencing of SFRP1 and LIPG is a potential driver event in ovarian cancer metastasis. They can be used as prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for ovarian cancer patients.© 2023.

"37415875","Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Type 2 Diabetes: Mendelian Randomization Analysis.","J Endocr Soc","The causality and pathways of the associations between physical activity and inactivity and the risk of type 2 diabetes remain inconclusive.We conducted an updated mendelian randomization (MR) study to explore the associations of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and leisure screen time (LST) with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).Genetic variants strongly associated with MVPA or LST with low linkage disequilibrium were selected as instrumental variables from a genome-wide meta-analysis including more than 600 000 individuals. Summary-level data on T2DM were obtained from the DIAbetes Genetics Replication And Meta-analysis consortium including 898 130 individuals. Data on possible intermediates (adiposity indicators, lean mass, glycemic traits, and inflammatory biomarkers) were extracted from large-scale genome-wide association studies (n = 21 758-681 275). Univariable and multivariable MR analyses were performed to estimate the total and direct effects of MVPA and LST on T2DM. Methylation MR analysis was performed for MVPA in relation to diabetes.The odds ratio of T2DM was 0.70 (95% CI, 0.55-0.88;P= .002) per unit increase in the log-odds ratio of having MVPA and 1.45 (95% CI, 1.30-1.62;P= 7.62 × 10-11) per SD increase in genetically predicted LST. These associations attenuated in multivariable MR analyses adjusted for genetically predicted waist-to-hip ratio, body mass index, lean mass, and circulating C-reactive protein. The association between genetically predicted MVPA and T2DM attenuated after adjusting for genetically predicted fasting insulin levels. Two physical activity-related methylation biomarkers (cg17332422 inADAMTS2and cg09531019) were associated with the risk of T2DM (P< .05).The study suggests causal associations of MVPA and LST with T2DM that appear to be mediated by obesity, lean mass, and chronic low-grade inflammation.© The Author(s) 2023.

"37415601","Identifying potential risk genes and pathways for neuropsychiatric and substance use disorders using intermediate molecular mediator information.","Front Genet","Neuropsychiatric and substance use disorders (NPSUDs) have a complex etiology that includes environmental and polygenic risk factors with significant cross-trait genetic correlations. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of NPSUDs yield numerous association signals. However, for most of these regions, we do not yet have a firm understanding of either the specific risk variants or the effects of these variants. Post-GWAS methods allow researchers to use GWAS summary statistics and molecular mediators (transcript, protein, and methylation abundances) infer the effect of these mediators on risk for disorders. One group of post-GWAS approaches is commonly referred to as transcriptome/proteome/methylome-wide association studies, which are abbreviated as T/P/MWAS (or collectively as XWAS). Since these approaches use biological mediators, the multiple testing burden is reduced to the number of genes (∼20,000) instead of millions of GWAS SNPs, which leads to increased signal detection. In this work, our aim is to uncover likely risk genes for NPSUDs by performing XWAS analyses in two tissues-blood and brain. First, to identify putative causal risk genes, we performed an XWAS using the Summary-data-based Mendelian randomization, which uses GWAS summary statistics, reference xQTL data, and a reference LD panel. Second, given the large comorbidities among NPSUDs and the shared cis-xQTLs between blood and the brain, we improved XWAS signal detection for underpowered analyses by performing joint concordance analyses between XWAS results i) across the two tissues and ii) across NPSUDs. All XWAS signals i) were adjusted for heterogeneity in dependent instruments (HEIDI) (non-causality)p-values and ii) used to test for pathway enrichment. The results suggest that there were widely shared gene/protein signals within the major histocompatibility complex region on chromosome 6 (BTN3A2andC4A) and elsewhere in the genome (FURIN, NEK4, RERE,andZDHHC5). The identification of putative molecular genes and pathways underlying risk may offer new targets for therapeutic development. Our study revealed an enrichment of XWAS signals in vitamin D and omega-3 gene sets. So, including vitamin D and omega-3 in treatment plans may have a modest but beneficial effect on patients with bipolar disorder.Copyright © 2023 Gedik, Nguyen, Peterson, Chatzinakos, Vladimirov, Riley and Bacanu."

Therefore, we performed the first epigenome-wide study to profile methylation of all three tissue types combined and to identify discriminatory biomarkers.Public methylation array data (Illumina EPIC and 450K) were collected from a total of 1 892 colorectal samples. Pairwise differential methylation analyses between tissue types were performed for both array types to ""double evidence"" differentially methylated probes (DE DMPs). Subsequently, the identified DMPs were filtered on methylation level and used to build a binary logistic regression prediction model. Focusing on the clinically most interesting group (adenoma vs carcinoma), we identified 13 DE DMPs that could effectively discriminate between them (AUC = 0.996). We validated this model in an in-house experimental methylation dataset of 13 adenomas and 9 carcinomas. It reached a sensitivity and specificity of 96% and 95%, respectively, with an overall accuracy of 96%. Our findings raise the possibility that the 13 DE DMPs identified in this study can be used as molecular biomarkers in the clinic.Our analyses show that methylation biomarkers have the potential to discriminate between normal, precursor and carcinoma tissues of the colorectum. More importantly, we highlight the power of the methylome as a source of markers for discriminating between colorectal adenomas and carcinomas, which currently remains an unmet clinical need.© 2023.

"37415231","Epigenetic marks associated with gestational diabetes mellitus across two time points during pregnancy.","Clin Epigenetics","An adverse intrauterine or periconceptional environment, such as hyperglycemia during pregnancy, can affect the DNA methylation pattern both in mothers and their offspring. In this study, we explored the epigenetic profile in maternal peripheral blood samples through pregnancy to find potential epigenetic biomarkers for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), as well as candidate genes involved in GDM development. We performed an epigenome-wide association study in maternal peripheral blood samples in 32 pregnant women (16 with GDM and 16 non-GDM) at pregnancy week 24-28 and 36-38. Biochemical, anthropometric, and obstetrical variables were collected from all the participants. The main results were validated in an independent cohort with different ethnic origin (European = 307; South Asians = 165). Two hundred and seventy-two CpGs sites remained significantly different between GDM and non-GDM pregnant women across two time points during pregnancy. The significant CpG sites were related to pathways associated with type I diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance and secretion. Cg01459453 (SELP gene) was the most differentiated in the GDM group versus non-GDM (73.6 vs. 60.9, p = 1.06E-11; FDR = 7.87E-06). Three CpG sites (cg01459453, cg15329406, and cg04095097) were able to discriminate between GDM cases and controls (AUC = 1; p = 1.26E-09). Three differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were replicated in an independent cohort. To conclude, epigenetic marks during pregnancy differed between GDM cases and controls suggesting a role for these genes in GDM development. Three CpGs were able to discriminate GDM and non-GDM groups with high specificity and sensitivity, which may be biomarker candidates for diagnosis or prediction of GDM.© 2023. The Author(s)."

DNA methylation may play an important role in the development of TD.DNA methylation analyses in schizophrenia with TD.We conducted a genome-wide DNA methylation analysis in schizophrenia with TD using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation coupled with next-generation sequencing (MeDIP-Seq) in a Chinese sample including five schizophrenia patients with TD and five without TD (NTD), and five healthy controls. The results were expressed as the log2FC, fold change of normalized tags between two groups within the differentially methylated region (DMR). For validation, the pyrosequencing was used to quantify DNA methylation levels of several methylated genes in an independent sample (n = 30).Through genome-wide MeDIP-Seq analysis, we identified 116 genes that were significantly differentially methylated in promotor regions in comparison of TD group with NTD group including 66 hypermethylated genes (top 4 genes are GABRR1, VANGL2, ZNF534, and ZNF746) and 50 hypomethylated genes (top 4 genes are DERL3, GSTA4, KNCN, and LRRK1). Part of these genes (such as DERL3, DLGAP2, GABRR1, KLRG2, LRRK1, VANGL2, and ZP3) were previously reported to be associated with methylation in schizophrenia. Gene Ontology enrichment and KEGG pathway analyses identified several pathways. So far, we have confirmed the methylation of 3 genes (ARMC6, WDR75, and ZP3) in schizophrenia with TD using pyrosequencing.This study identified number of methylated genes and pathways for TD and will provide potential biomarkers for TD and serve as a resource for replication in other populations.© 2023.

"37414416","Methylome response to proteasome inhibition by the Pseudomonas syringae virulence factor Syringolin A.","Mol Plant Microbe Interact","DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mark required for proper gene expression and silencing of transposable elements. DNA methylation patterns can be modified by environmental factors such as pathogen infection, where modification of DNA methylation can be associated with plant resistance. To counter the plant defense pathways, pathogens produce effector molecules, several of which act as proteasome inhibitors. Here we investigated the effect of proteasome inhibition by the bacterial virulence factor Syringolin A on genome-wide DNA methylation. We show that Syringolin A treatment results in an increase of DNA methylation at centromeric and pericentromeric regions of Arabidopsis chromosomes. We identify several CHH DMRs that are enriched in the proximity of transcriptional start sites. Syringolin A treatment does not result in significant changes in small RNA composition. However, significant changes in genome transcriptional activity can be observed, including a strong upregulation of resistance genes that are located on chromosomal arms. We hypothesize that DNA methylation changes could be linked to the upregulation of some atypical members of the de novo DNA methylation pathway: AGO3, AGO9 and DRM1. Our data suggests that modification of genome-wide DNA methylation resulting from an inhibition of the proteasome by bacterial effectors could be part of an epi-genomic arms race against pathogens."
"37410739","Blood-based epigenome-wide analyses of 19 common disease states: A longitudinal, population-based linked cohort study of 18,413 Scottish individuals.","PLoS Med","DNA methylation is a dynamic epigenetic mechanism that occurs at cytosine-phosphate-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) sites. Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) investigate the strength of association between methylation at individual CpG sites and health outcomes. Although blood methylation may act as a peripheral marker of common disease states, previous EWAS have typically focused only on individual conditions and have had limited power to discover disease-associated loci. This study examined the association of blood DNA methylation with the prevalence of 14 disease states and the incidence of 19 disease states in a single population of over 18,000 Scottish individuals.DNA methylation was assayed at 752,722 CpG sites in whole-blood samples from 18,413 volunteers in the family-structured, population-based cohort study Generation Scotland (age range 18 to 99 years). EWAS tested for cross-sectional associations between baseline CpG methylation and 14 prevalent disease states, and for longitudinal associations between baseline CpG methylation and 19 incident disease states. Prevalent cases were self-reported on health questionnaires at the baseline. Incident cases were identified using linkage to Scottish primary (Read 2) and secondary (ICD-10) care records, and the censoring date was set to October 2020. The mean time-to-diagnosis ranged from 5.0 years (for chronic pain) to 11.7 years (for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) hospitalisation). The 19 disease states considered in this study were selected if they were present on the World Health Organisation's 10 leading causes of death and disease burden or included in baseline self-report questionnaires. EWAS models were adjusted for age at methylation typing, sex, estimated white blood cell composition, population structure, and 5 common lifestyle risk factors. A structured literature review was also conducted to identify existing EWAS for all 19 disease states tested. The MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and preprint servers were searched to retrieve relevant articles indexed as of March 27, 2023. Fifty-four of approximately 2,000 indexed articles met our inclusion criteria: assayed blood-based DNA methylation, had >20 individuals in each comparison group, and examined one of the 19 conditions considered. First, we assessed whether the associations identified in our study were reported in previous studies. We identified 69 associations between CpGs and the prevalence of 4 conditions, of which 58 were newly described. The conditions were breast cancer, chronic kidney disease, ischemic heart disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. We also uncovered 64 CpGs that associated with the incidence of 2 disease states (COPD and type 2 diabetes), of which 56 were not reported in the surveyed literature. Second, we assessed replication across existing studies, which was defined as the reporting of at least 1 common site in >2 studies that examined the same condition. Only 6/19 disease states had evidence of such replication. The limitations of this study include the nonconsideration of medication data and a potential lack of generalizability to individuals that are not of Scottish and European ancestry.We discovered over 100 associations between blood methylation sites and common disease states, independently of major confounding risk factors, and a need for greater standardisation among EWAS on human disease.Copyright: © 2023 Hillary et al.

Identifying genes for desirable traits, such as drought tolerance and disease resistance, is critical for improving the plant. Grass pea currently lacks known R-genes, including the nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) gene family, which plays a key role in protecting the plant from biotic and abiotic stresses. In our study, we used the recently published grass pea genome and available transcriptomic data to identify 274 NBS-LRR genes. The evolutionary relationships between the classified genes on the reported plants and LsNBS revealed that 124 genes have TNL domains, while 150 genes have CNL domains. All genes contained exons, ranging from 1 to 7. Ten conserved motifs with lengths ranging from 16 to 30 amino acids were identified. We found TIR-domain-containing genes in 132 LsNBSs, with 63 TIR-1 and 69 TIR-2, and RX-CCLike in 84 LsNBSs. We also identified several popular motifs, including P-loop, Uup, kinase-GTPase, ABC, ChvD, CDC6, Rnase_H, Smc, CDC48, and SpoVK. According to the gene enrichment analysis, the identified genes undergo several biological processes such as plant defense, innate immunity, hydrolase activity, and DNA binding. In the upstream regions, 103 transcription factors were identified that govern the transcription of nearby genes affecting the plant excretion of salicylic acid, methyl jasmonate, ethylene, and abscisic acid. According to RNA-Seq expression analysis, 85% of the encoded genes have high expression levels. Nine LsNBS genes were selected for qPCR under salt stress conditions. The majority of the genes showed upregulation at 50 and 200 μM NaCl. However,LsNBS-D18,LsNBS-D204, andLsNBS-D180showed reduced or drastic downregulation compared to their respective expression levels, providing further insights into the potential functions of LsNBSs under salt stress conditions. They provide valuable insights into the potential functions of LsNBSs under salt stress conditions. Our findings also shed light on the evolution and classification of NBS-LRR genes in legumes, highlighting the potential of grass pea. Further research could focus on the functional analysis of these genes, and their potential use in breeding programs to improve the salinity, drought, and disease resistance of this important crop.Copyright © 2023 Alsamman, Mousa, Nassar, Faheem, Radwan, Adly, Hussein, Istanbuli, Mokhtar, Elakkad, Kehel, Hamwieh, Abdelsattar and El Allali."

"37528416","A role for SETD2 loss in tumorigenesis through DNA methylation dysregulation.","BMC Cancer","SETD2-dependent H3 Lysine-36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) has been recently linked to the deposition of de-novo DNA methylation. SETD2 is frequently mutated in cancer, however, the functional impact of SETD2 loss and depletion on DNA methylation across cancer types and tumorigenesis is currently unknown. Here, we perform a pan-cancer analysis and show that both SETD2 mutation and reduced expression are associated with DNA methylation dysregulation across 21 out of the 24 cancer types tested. In renal cancer, these DNA methylation changes are associated with altered gene expression of oncogenes, tumour suppressors, and genes involved in neoplasm invasiveness, including TP53, FOXO1, and CDK4. This suggests a new role for SETD2 loss in tumorigenesis and cancer aggressiveness through DNA methylation dysregulation. Moreover, using a robust machine learning methodology, we develop and validate a 3-CpG methylation signature which is sufficient to predict SETD2 mutation status with high accuracy and correlates with patient prognosis.© 2023.

Identifying differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs) in cancer samples is a crucial step toward understanding these changes. In this paper, we propose a trans-dimensional Markov chain Monte Carlo (TMCMC) approach that uses hidden Markov models (HMMs) with binomial emission, and bisulfite sequencing (BS-Seq) data, called DMCTHM , to identify DMCs in cancer epigenetic studies. We introduce the Expander-Collider penalty to tackle under and overestimation in TMCMC-HMMs. We address all known challenges inherent in BS-Seq data by introducing novel approaches for capturing functional patterns and autocorrelation structure of the data, as well as for handling missing values, multiple covariates, multiple comparisons, and family-wise errors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DMCTHM through comprehensive simulation studies. The results show that our proposed method outperforms other competing methods in identifying DMCs. Notably, with DMCTHM , we uncovered new DMCs and genes in Colorectal cancer that were significantly enriched in the Tp53 pathway."

Single locus methylomic analysis and co-methylation analysis showed a higher number of OUD-associated genes and gene networks for 5hmC compared to 5mC; these were enriched for GPCR, Wnt, neurogenesis, and opioid signaling. 5hmC marks also showed a higher correlation with gene expression patterns and enriched for GWAS of psychiatric traits. Drug interaction analysis revealed interactions with opioid-related drugs, some used as OUD treatments.

The proportions of immune cell types were observed from routine blood tests or estimated from DNA methylation profiles. For both observed and estimated immune cell proportions, we tested their associations with risk factors of ACS by multivariable linear regression models. In addition, the association of each immune cell proportion with incident ACS was assessed by the Cox regression model and conditional logistic regression model, respectively, adjusting for the risk factors of ACS.The proportions of lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils showed strong associations with sex, followed by diabetes. Moreover, sex and current smoking were the two factors with strongest association with the proportions of lymphocyte subtypes. The hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of incident ACS per standard deviation (SD) increase in proportions of lymphocytes and neutrophils were 0.91 (0.85-0.96) and 1.10 (1.03-1.16), respectively. Furthermore, the OR (95% CI) of incident ACS per SD increase in proportions of NK cells, CD4+T cells, and B cells were 0.88 (0.78-0.99), 1.15 (1.03-1.30), and 1.13 (1.00-1.26), respectively.The proportions of immune cells were associated with several risk factors of ACS, including sex, diabetes, and current smoking. In addition, proportion of neutrophils had a risk effect, while proportion of lymphocytes had a protective effect on the incidence of ACS. The protective effect of lymphocytes was probably driven by NK cells.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Disturbance of imprinting has been implicated in a range of diseases, ranging from debilitating syndromes to cancers to fetal deficiencies. Despite this, studies done on the prevalence and relevance of imprinting on genes have been limited in scope, tissue types available, and focus, by both availability and resources. This has left a gap in comparative studies. To address this, we assembled a collection of imprinted genes available in current literature covering five species. Here we sought to identify trends and motifs in the imprinted gene set (IGS) in three distinct arenas: evolutionary conservation, across-tissue expression, and health phenomics. Overall, we found that imprinted genes displayed less conservation and higher proportions of non-coding RNA while maintaining synteny. Maternally expressed genes (MEGs) and paternally expressed genes (PEGs) occupied distinct roles in tissue expression and biological pathway use, while imprinted genes collectively showed a broader tissue range, notable preference for tissue specific expression and limited gene pathways than comparable sex differentiation genes. Both human and murine imprinted genes showed the same clear phenotypic trends, that were distinct from those displayed by sex differentiation genes which were less involved in mental and nervous system disease. While both sets had representation across the genome, the IGS showed clearer clustering as expected, with PEGs significantly more represented than MEGs.© The author(s)."

Elevated levels of PM in polluted air have been correlated with the onset and development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This systematic review was conducted to evaluate biomarkers that could reflect the effects of PM exposure in patients with COPD.We performed a systematic review of studies published on biomarkers associated with PM exposure in patients with COPD between January 01, 2012 and June 30, 2022 in PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases. Studies that included data on biomarkers with COPD exposed PM were eligible for inclusion. Biomarkers were classified into 4 groups according to their mechanisms.Of the 105 studies identified, 22 were included in this study. Nearly 50 biomarkers have been proposed in the studies included in this review, and the most studied in relation to PM are several interleukins. Various mechanisms have been reported by which PM induces and aggravates COPD. Six studies related to oxidative stress, one related to direct effect of innate and adaptive immune systems, 16 associated with genetic regulation of inflammation, and two related to epigenetic regulation of physiology and susceptibility were found. Biomarkers related to these mechanisms were detected in serum, sputum, urine, exhaled breath concentration (EBC), and showed various correlations with PM in COPD.Various biomarkers have shown potential in predicting the extent of PM exposure in COPD patients. Future studies are needed to establish recommendations for regulation to reduce airborne PM, which could be used to develop strategies for prevention and management of environmental respiratory diseases.2023 Journal of Thoracic Disease.

Blood immune cell numbers oscillate throughout the day, in health and asthma. Peripheral blood mononucleocytes from asthma patients show significantly enhanced responses to immune stimulation and steroid suppression at 16:00 h, compared to at 04:00 h. Serum ceramides show complex changes in asthma: some losing and others gaining rhythmicity.This is the first report showing that asthma is associated with a gain in peripheral blood molecular clock rhythmicity. Whether the blood clock is responding to rhythmic signals received from the lung or driving rhythmic pathology within the lung itself is not clear. Dynamic changes occur in serum ceramides in asthma, probably reflecting systemic inflammatory action. The enhanced responses of asthma blood immune cells to glucocorticoid at 16:00 h may explain why steroid administration is more effective at this time.Copyright ©The authors 2023."
"37452103","Culture expansion of CAR T cells results in aberrant DNA methylation that is associated with adverse clinical outcome.","Leukemia","Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells provide new perspectives for treatment of hematological malignancies. Manufacturing of these cellular products includes culture expansion procedures, which may affect cellular integrity and therapeutic outcome. In this study, we investigated culture-associated epigenetic changes in CAR T cells and found continuous gain of DNAm, particularly within genes that are relevant for T cell function. Hypermethylation in many genes, such as TCF7, RUNX1, and TOX, was reflected by transcriptional downregulation. 332 CG dinucleotides (CpGs) showed an almost linear gain in methylation with cell culture time, albeit neighboring CpGs were not coherently regulated on the same DNA strands. An epigenetic signature based on 14 of these culture-associated CpGs predicted cell culture time across various culture conditions. Notably, even in CAR T cell products of similar culture time higher DNAm levels at these CpGs were associated with significantly reduced long-term survival post transfusion. Our data demonstrate that cell culture expansion of CAR T cells evokes DNA hypermethylation at specific sites in the genome and the signature may also reflect loss of potential in CAR T cell products. Hence, reduced cultivation periods are beneficial to avoid dysfunctional methylation programs that seem to be associated with worse therapeutic outcome.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37420130","Genetic associations vary across the spectrum of fasting serum insulin: results from the European IDEFICS/I.Family children's cohort.","Diabetologia","There is increasing evidence for the existence of shared genetic predictors of metabolic traits and neurodegenerative disease. We previously observed a U-shaped association between fasting insulin in middle-aged women and dementia up to 34 years later. In the present study, we performed genome-wide association (GWA) analyses for fasting serum insulin in European children with a focus on variants associated with the tails of the insulin distribution.Genotyping was successful in 2825 children aged 2-14 years at the time of insulin measurement. Because insulin levels vary during childhood, GWA analyses were based on age- and sex-specific z scores. Five percentile ranks of z-insulin were selected and modelled using logistic regression, i.e. the 15th, 25th, 50th, 75th and 85th percentile ranks (P15-P85). Additive genetic models were adjusted for age, sex, BMI, survey year, survey country and principal components derived from genetic data to account for ethnic heterogeneity. Quantile regression was used to determine whether associations with variants identified by GWA analyses differed across quantiles of log-insulin.A variant in the SLC28A1 gene (rs2122859) was associated with the 85th percentile rank of the insulin z score (P85, p value=3×10-8). Two variants associated with low z-insulin (P15, p value <5×10-6) were located on the RBFOX1 and SH3RF3 genes. These genes have previously been associated with both metabolic traits and dementia phenotypes. While variants associated with P50 showed stable associations across the insulin spectrum, we found that associations with variants identified through GWA analyses of P15 and P85 varied across quantiles of log-insulin.The above results support the notion of a shared genetic architecture for dementia and metabolic traits. Our approach identified genetic variants that were associated with the tails of the insulin spectrum only. Because traditional heritability estimates assume that genetic effects are constant throughout the phenotype distribution, the new findings may have implications for understanding the discrepancy in heritability estimates from GWA and family studies and for the study of U-shaped biomarker-disease associations.© 2023.

This was a case-control study nested in the Spanish HIV/AIDS Cohort (CoRIS). Cases with myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden death, or diabetes after starting antiretroviral therapy were included with the available samples and controls matched for sex, age, tobacco use, pre-ART CD4 cell count, viral load, and sample time-point. TL (T/S ratio) was analysed by quantitative PCR and EAA with DNA methylation changes by next-generation sequencing using the Weidner formula. Conditional logistic regression was used to explore the association with cardiometabolic events. In total, 180 participants (94 cases (22 myocardial infarction/sudden death, 12 strokes, and 60 DM) and 94 controls) were included. Of these, 84% were male, median (IQR) age 46 years (40-56), 53% were current smokers, and 22% had CD4 count ≤ 200 cells/mm3and a median (IQR) log viral load of 4.52 (3.77-5.09). TL and EAA were similar in the cases and controls. There were no significant associations between TL, EAA, and monocyte cytokines with cardiometabolic events. TL and EAA were mildly negatively correlated with sCD14 (rho = -0.23;p= 0.01) and CCL2/MCP-1 (rho = -0.17;p= 0.02). We found no associations between TL, EAA, and monocyte cytokines with cardiovascular events or diabetes.

In addition to major genetic contributors of FTLD such as mutations inMAPT,GRN, andC9orf72, recent work has identified several epigenetic modifications including significant differential DNA methylation inDLX1, andOTUD4loci. As aging remains one of the major risk factors for FTLD, we investigated the presence of accelerated epigenetic aging in FTLD compared to controls. We calculated epigenetic age in both peripheral blood and brain tissues of multiple FTLD subtypes using several DNA methylation clocks, i.e., DNAmClockMulti, DNAmClockHannum, DNAmClockCortical, GrimAge, and PhenoAge, and determined age acceleration and its association with different cellular proportions and clinical traits. Significant epigenetic age acceleration was observed in the peripheral blood of both frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) patients compared to controls with DNAmClockHannum, even after accounting for confounding factors. A similar trend was observed with both DNAmClockMultiand DNAmClockCorticalin post-mortem frontal cortex tissue of PSP patients and in FTLD cases harboringGRNmutations. Our findings support that increased epigenetic age acceleration in the peripheral blood could be an indicator for PSP and to a smaller extent, FTD."
"37501048","Systemic inflammation and biological aging in the Health and Retirement Study.","Geroscience","Chronic, low-level systemic inflammation associated with aging, or inflammaging, is a risk factor for several chronic diseases and mortality. Using data from the Health and Retirement Study, we generated a continuous latent variable for systemic inflammation from seven measured indicators of inflammation and examined associations with another biomarker of biological aging, DNA methylation age acceleration measured by epigenetic clocks, and 4-year mortality (N = 3,113). We found that greater systemic inflammation was positively associated with DNA methylation age acceleration for 10 of the 13 epigenetic clocks, after adjustment for sociodemographics and chronic disease risk factors. The latent variable for systemic inflammation was associated with 4-year mortality independent of DNA methylation age acceleration and was a better predictor of 4-year mortality than any of the epigenetic clocks examined, as well as mortality risk factors, including obesity and multimorbidity. Inflammaging and DNA methylation age acceleration may represent different biological processes contributing to mortality risk. Leveraging multiple measured inflammation markers to capture inflammaging is important for biology of aging research.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37484911","The influence of early environment and micronutrient availability on developmental epigenetic programming: lessons from the placenta.","Front Cell Dev Biol","DNA methylation is the most commonly studied epigenetic mark in humans, as it is well recognised as a stable, heritable mark that can affect genome function and influence gene expression. Somatic DNA methylation patterns that can persist throughout life are established shortly after fertilisation when the majority of epigenetic marks, including DNA methylation, are erased from the pre-implantation embryo. Therefore, the period around conception is potentially critical for influencing DNA methylation, including methylation at imprinted alleles and metastable epialleles (MEs), loci where methylation varies between individuals but is correlated across tissues. Exposures before and during conception can affect pregnancy outcomes and health throughout life. Retrospective studies of the survivors of famines, such as those exposed to the Dutch Hunger Winter of 1944-45, have linked exposures around conception to later disease outcomes, some of which correlate with DNA methylation changes at certain genes. Animal models have shown more directly that DNA methylation can be affected by dietary supplements that act as cofactors in one-carbon metabolism, and in humans, methylation at birth has been associated with peri-conceptional micronutrient supplementation. However, directly showing a role of micronutrients in shaping the epigenome has proven difficult. Recently, the placenta, a tissue with a unique hypomethylated methylome, has been shown to possess great inter-individual variability, which we highlight as a promising target tissue for studying MEs and mixed environmental exposures. The placenta has a critical role shaping the health of the fetus. Placenta-associated pregnancy complications, such as preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction, are all associated with aberrant patterns of DNA methylation and expression which are only now being linked to disease risk later in life.Copyright © 2023 Sainty, Silver, Prentice and Monk."
"37439885","Measuring healthy ageing: current and future tools.","Biogerontology","Human ageing is a complex, multifactorial process characterised by physiological damage, increased risk of age-related diseases and inevitable functional deterioration. As the population of the world grows older, placing significant strain on social and healthcare resources, there is a growing need to identify reliable and easy-to-employ markers of healthy ageing for early detection of ageing trajectories and disease risk. Such markers would allow for the targeted implementation of strategies or treatments that can lessen suffering, disability, and dependence in old age. In this review, we summarise the healthy ageing scores reported in the literature, with a focus on the past 5 years, and compare and contrast the variables employed. The use of approaches to determine biological age, molecular biomarkers, ageing trajectories, and multi-omics ageing scores are reviewed. We conclude that the ideal healthy ageing score is multisystemic and able to encompass all of the potential alterations associated with ageing. It should also be longitudinal and able to accurately predict ageing complications at an early stage in order to maximize the chances of successful early intervention.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37433036","Cumulative stress, PTSD, and emotion dysregulation during pregnancy and epigenetic age acceleration in Hispanic mothers and their newborn infants.","Epigenetics","Pregnancy can exacerbate or prompt the onset of stress-related disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is associated with heightened stress responsivity and emotional dysregulation, as well as increased risk of chronic disorders and mortality. Further, maternal PTSD is associated with gestational epigenetic age acceleration in newborns, implicating the prenatal period as a developmental time period for the transmission of effects across generations. Here, we evaluated the associations between PTSD symptoms, maternal epigenetic age acceleration, and infant gestational epigenetic age acceleration in 89 maternal-neonatal dyads. Trauma-related experiences and PTSD symptoms in mothers were assessed during the third trimester of pregnancy. The MethylationEPIC array was used to generate DNA methylation data from maternal and neonatal saliva samples collected within 24 h of infant birth. Maternal epigenetic age acceleration was calculated using Horvath's multi-tissue clock, PhenoAge and GrimAge. Gestational epigenetic age was estimated using the Haftorn clock. Maternal cumulative past-year stress (GrimAge:p = 3.23e-04, PhenoAge:p = 9.92e-03), PTSD symptoms (GrimAge:p = 0.019), and difficulties in emotion regulation (GrimAge:p = 0.028) were associated with accelerated epigenetic age in mothers. Maternal PTSD symptoms were associated with lower gestational epigenetic age acceleration in neonates (p = 0.032). Overall, our results suggest that maternal cumulative past-year stress exposure and trauma-related symptoms may increase the risk for age-related problems in mothers and developmental problems in their newborns."
"37425825","Multi-omics characterization of partial chemical reprogramming reveals evidence of cell rejuvenation.","bioRxiv","Partial reprogramming by cyclic short-term expression of Yamanaka factors holds promise for shifting cells to younger states and consequently delaying the onset of many diseases of aging. However, the delivery of transgenes and potential risk of teratoma formation present challenges forin vivoapplications. Recent advances include the use of cocktails of compounds to reprogram somatic cells, but the characteristics and mechanisms of partial cellular reprogramming by chemicals remain unclear. Here, we report a multi-omics characterization of partial chemical reprogramming in fibroblasts from young and aged mice. We measured the effects of partial chemical reprogramming on the epigenome, transcriptome, proteome, phosphoproteome, and metabolome. At the transcriptome, proteome, and phosphoproteome levels, we saw widescale changes induced by this treatment, with the most notable signature being an upregulation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, at the metabolome level, we observed a reduction in the accumulation of aging-related metabolites. Using both transcriptomic and epigenetic clock-based analyses, we show that partial chemical reprogramming reduces the biological age of mouse fibroblasts. We demonstrate that these changes have functional impacts, as evidenced by changes in cellular respiration and mitochondrial membrane potential. Taken together, these results illuminate the potential for chemical reprogramming reagents to rejuvenate aged biological systems, and warrant further investigation into adapting these approaches forin vivoage reversal."
"37420032","GWAS of biological aging to find longevity genes in schizophrenia.","Eur Arch Psychiatry Clin Neurosci","Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a severe psychotic disorder associated with premature mortality and aging. Moreover, the symptoms and progression of psychiatric disorders in general are associated with decreased lifespan, biological aging, and poorer medical outcomes. In this study, we investigated the relationship between several epigenetic clocks and scanned the entire genome for association in a cohort of SCZ individuals (n = 107). Biological age was computed from blood DNA methylation (DNAm) and tested for association against  common  variants across the genome using general linear models. Genes affecting epigenetic age acceleration in our cohort were found mainly when using the telomeric length clock rather than the other biological clocks. These findings pair with existing evidence that there are some genes associated with longevity and suggest further investigations of  putative biological mechanisms for morbidity and premature mortality, not only in patients with SCZ but also in the general population.© 2023.

"37405974","Contributions of neighborhood social environment and air pollution exposure to Black-White disparities in epigenetic aging.","PLoS One","Racial disparities in many aging-related health outcomes are persistent and pervasive among older Americans, reflecting accelerated biological aging for Black Americans compared to White, known as weathering. Environmental determinants that contribute to weathering are poorly understood. Having a higher biological age, measured by DNA methylation (DNAm), than chronological age is robustly associated with worse age-related outcomes and higher social adversity. We hypothesize that individual socioeconomic status (SES), neighborhood social environment, and air pollution exposures contribute to racial disparities in DNAm aging according to GrimAge and Dunedin Pace of Aging methylation (DPoAm). We perform retrospective cross-sectional analyses among 2,960 non-Hispanic participants (82% White, 18% Black) in the Health and Retirement Study whose 2016 DNAm age is linked to survey responses and geographic data. DNAm aging is defined as the residual after regressing DNAm age on chronological age. We observe Black individuals have significantly accelerated DNAm aging on average compared to White individuals according to GrimAge (239%) and DPoAm (238%). We implement multivariable linear regression models and threefold decomposition to identify exposures that contribute to this disparity. Exposure measures include individual-level SES, census-tract-level socioeconomic deprivation and air pollution (fine particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone), and perceived neighborhood social and physical disorder. Race and gender are included as covariates. Regression and decomposition results show that individual-level SES is strongly associated with and accounts for a large portion of the disparity in both GrimAge and DPoAm aging. Higher neighborhood deprivation for Black participants significantly contributes to the disparity in GrimAge aging. Black participants are more vulnerable to fine particulate matter exposure for DPoAm, perhaps due to individual- and neighborhood-level SES, which may contribute to the disparity in DPoAm aging. DNAm aging may play a role in the environment ""getting under the skin"", contributing to age-related health disparities between older Black and White Americans.Copyright: © 2023 Yannatos et al.

We pooled data from three population-based cohorts, the Framingham Heart Study Offspring Cohort, the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, and the InCHIANTI Study, including 1,062 postmenopausal women without hormone therapy and 1,612 men of European descent. Sex-stratified analyses using a linear mixed regression were performed, with a Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) adjustment for multiple testing.

We aimed to clarify the relationship of accelerated biological age, assessed through two established biological age indicators, telomere length and DNA methylation age, and two novel candidate biological age indicators, to child developmental outcomes, including growth and adiposity, cognition, behavior, lung function and the onset of puberty, among European school-age children participating in the HELIX exposome cohort.The study population included up to 1173 children, aged between 5 and 12 years, from study centres in the UK, France, Spain, Norway, Lithuania, and Greece. Telomere length was measured through qPCR, blood DNA methylation, and gene expression was measured using microarray, and proteins and metabolites were measured by a range of targeted assays. DNA methylation age was assessed using Horvath's skin and blood clock, while novel blood transcriptome and 'immunometabolic' (based on plasma proteins and urinary and serum metabolites) clocks were derived and tested in a subset of children assessed six months after the main follow-up visit. Associations between biological age indicators with child developmental measures as well as health risk factors were estimated using linear regression, adjusted for chronological age, sex, ethnicity, and study centre. The clock derived markers were expressed as Δ age (i.e. predicted minus chronological age).Transcriptome and immunometabolic clocks predicted chronological age well in the test set (r=0.93 andr=0.84 respectively). Generally, weak correlations were observed, after adjustment for chronological age, between the biological age indicators.Among associations with health risk factors, higher birthweight was associated with greater immunometabolic Δ age, smoke exposure with greater DNA methylation Δ age, and high family affluence with longer telomere length.Among associations with child developmental measures, all biological age markers were associated with greater BMI and fat mass, and all markers except telomere length were associated with greater height, at least at nominal significance (p<0.05). Immunometabolic Δ age was associated with better working memory (p=4 e-3) and reduced inattentiveness (p=4 e-4), while DNA methylation Δ age was associated with greater inattentiveness (p=0.03) and poorer externalizing behaviors (p=0.01). Shorter telomere length was also associated with poorer externalizing behaviors (p=0.03).In children, as in adults, biological aging appears to be a multi-faceted process and adiposity is an important correlate of accelerated biological aging. Patterns of associations suggested that accelerated immunometabolic age may be beneficial for some aspects of child development while accelerated DNA methylation age and telomere attrition may reflect early detrimental aspects of biological aging, apparent even in children.UK Research and Innovation (MR/S03532X/1); European Commission (grant agreement numbers: 308333; 874583).© 2023, Robinson et al."

The journey from the discovery of DNA methylation (DNAm) as a biological process to its emergence as a diagnostic tool is one of the finest examples of such metamorphosis and has taken nearly a century. Particularly in the last decade, the application of DNA methylation studies in the clinic has been standardized more than ever before, with great potential to diagnose a multitude of diseases that are associated with a burgeoning number of genes with this epigenetic alteration. Fetal DNAm detection is becoming useful for noninvasive prenatal testing, whereas, in very preterm infants, DNAm is also shown to be a potential biological indicator of prenatal risk factors. In the context of cancer, liquid biopsy-based DNA-methylation profiling is offering valuable epigenetic biomarkers for noninvasive early-stage diagnosis. In this review, we focus on the applications of DNA methylation in prenatal diagnosis for delivering timely therapy before or after birth and in detecting early-stage cancers for better clinical outcomes. Furthermore, we also provide an up-to-date commercial landscape of DNAm biomarkers for cancer detection and screening of cancers of unknown origin."
"37446239","Cryopreservation of Ovarian and Testicular Tissue and the Influence on Epigenetic Pattern.","Int J Mol Sci","Ovarian tissue cryopreservation (OTC) or testicular tissue cryopreservation (TTC) are effective and often the only options for fertility preservation in female or male patients due to oncological, medical, or social aspects. While TTC and resumption of spermatogenesis, either in vivo or in vitro, has still be considered an experimental approach in humans, OTC and autotransplantation has been applied increasingly to preserve fertility, with more than 200 live births worldwide. However, the cryopreservation of reproductive cells followed by the resumption of gametogenesis, either in vivo or in vitro, may interfere with sensitive and highly regulated cellular processes. In particular, the epigenetic profile, which includes not just reversible modifications of the DNA itself but also post-translational histone modifications, small non-coding RNAs, gene expression and availability, and storage of related proteins or transcripts, have to be considered in this context. Due to complex reprogramming and maintenance mechanisms of the epigenome in germ cells, growing embryos, and offspring, OTC and TTC are carried out at very critical moments early in the life cycle. Given this background, the safety of OTC and TTC, taking into account the epigenetic profile, has to be clarified. Cryopreservation of mature germ cells (including metaphase II oocytes and mature spermatozoa collected via ejaculation or more invasively after testicular biopsy) or embryos has been used successfully for many years in medically assisted reproduction (MAR). However, tissue freezing followed by in vitro or in vivo gametogenesis has become more attractive in the past, while few human studies have analysed the epigenetic effects, with most data deriving from animal studies. In this review, we highlight the potential influence of the cryopreservation of immature germ cells and subsequent in vivo or in vitro growth and differentiation on the epigenetic profile (including DNA methylation, post-translational histone modifications, and the abundance and availability of relevant transcripts and proteins) in humans and animals."

Results from InCHIANTI follow-up study.","Res Sq","BackgroundNeutrophils and lymphocytes represent the larger percentage of all blood white cells, they vary with age, with a progressive increase of the ratio in the first years of life, and then tend to remain at similar levels in steady state condition during adult age. Neutrophils to lymphocytes-ratio (NL-ratio) was proposed as an effective and low-cost marker to monitor and predict clinical condition evolution. The main objective of the study is to analyze its temporal trend variation, over twenty years' follow-up, according to age, sex, and main clinical diagnosis, in a large representative Italian population.MethodsThe InCHIANTI study enrolled representative samples from the registry list of two towns in Tuscany, Italy. Baseline data were collected in 1998, and last follow-up visits in 2015-18. Out of the 1453 participants enrolled, 1343 were included, and consented to donate a blood sample. All subjects were assessed and followed for life-style, clinical condition, physical performance, and underwent an instrumental diagnostic session.ResultsThe NL-ratio showed a statistically significant interaction between birth-cohort and time of the study (p-value=0.005). A gender dimorphism was recognized in the neutrophils absolute count and in the NL-ratio. Moreover, in female participants only, those who reported CHF had lower neutrophil-count and NL-ratio; whereas an increase in creatinine clearance was directly associated with NL-ratio. In male subjects, an increase of BMI was inversely associated with both NL-ratio and neutrophils-count during the follow-up; a similar association but in the opposite direction was observed in female participants.ConclusionNL-ratio is a more reliable marker of biological age than absolute lymphocytes and/or neutrophils counts. It is associated with the changes induced by disease, lifestyle, and environmental challenges in the immune system. NL-ratio confirms the gender dimorphism in the occurrence of inflammation-driven diseases. Therefore, additional evidence emerged for the necessity for tailored sex-specific measures to prevent and treat such diseases."

Many epigenetic clocks have been developed for adults; however, there are fewer clocks focused on newborns and most are trained using blood from European ancestry populations. In this study, we built an epigenetic clock based on primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells from a racially and ethnically diverse population. Results Using human umbilical vein endothelial cell [HUVEC]-derived DNA, we calculated epigenetic gestational age using 83 CpG sites selected through elastic net regression. In this study with newborns from different racial/ethnic identities, epigenetic gestational age and clinical gestational age were more highly correlated (r = 0.85), than epigenetic clocks built from adult and other pediatric populations. The correlation was also higher than clocks based on blood samples from newborns with European ancestry. We also found that birth weight was positively associated with epigenetic gestational age acceleration (EGAA), while NICU admission was associated with lower EGAA. Newborns self-identified as Hispanic or non-Hispanic Black had lower EGAA than self-identified as non-Hispanic White. Conclusions Epigenetic gestational age can be used to estimate clinical gestational age and may help index neonatal development. Caution should be exercised when using epigenetic clocks built from adults with children, especially newborns. We highlight the importance of cell type-specific epigenetic clocks and general pan tissue epigenetic clocks derived from a large racially and ethnically diverse population."

Here we further investigated DNA methylation alterations in normal gastric mucosa in gastric cancer cases (n = 42) and control subjects (n = 42) withH. pyloriinfection data. We assessed tissue cell type composition, DNA methylation alterations within cell populations, epigenetic aging, and repetitive element methylation.In normal gastric mucosa of both gastric cancer cases and control subjects, we observed increased epigenetic age acceleration associated withH. pyloriinfection. We also observed an increased mitotic tick rate associated withH. pyloriinfection in both gastric cancer cases and controls. Significant differences in immune cell populations associated withH. pyloriinfection in normal tissue from cancer cases and controls were identified using DNA methylation cell type deconvolution.

However, few studies have compared the suitability of different molecular data types to predict age in the same cohort and whether combining them would improve predictions. Here, we explored this at the level of proteins and small RNAs in 103 human blood plasma samples. First, we used a two-step mass spectrometry approach measuring 612 proteins to select and quantify 21 proteins that changed in abundance with age. Notably, proteins increasing with age were enriched for components of the complement system. Next, we used small RNA sequencing to select and quantify a set of 315 small RNAs that changed in abundance with age. Most of these were microRNAs (miRNAs), downregulated with age, and predicted to target genes related to growth, cancer, and senescence. Finally, we used the collected data to build age-predictive models. Among the different types of molecules, proteins yielded the most accurate model (R² = 0.59 ± 0.02), followed by miRNAs as the best-performing class of small RNAs (R² = 0.54 ± 0.02). Interestingly, the use of protein and miRNA data together improved predictions (R2= 0.70 ± 0.01). Future work using larger sample sizes and a validation dataset will be necessary to confirm these results. Nevertheless, our study suggests that combining proteomic and miRNA data yields superior age predictions, possibly by capturing a broader range of age-related physiological changes. It will be interesting to determine if combining different molecular data types works as a general strategy to improve future aging clocks."
"37404460","Hierarchical deconvolution for extensive cell type resolution in the human brain using DNA methylation.","Front Neurosci","The human brain comprises heterogeneous cell types whose composition can be altered with physiological and pathological conditions. New approaches to discern the diversity and distribution of brain cells associated with neurological conditions would significantly advance the study of brain-related pathophysiology and neuroscience. Unlike single-nuclei approaches, DNA methylation-based deconvolution does not require special sample handling or processing, is cost-effective, and easily scales to large study designs. Existing DNA methylation-based methods for brain cell deconvolution are limited in the number of cell types deconvolved.Using DNA methylation profiles of the top cell-type-specific differentially methylated CpGs, we employed a hierarchical modeling approach to deconvolve GABAergic neurons, glutamatergic neurons, astrocytes, microglial cells, oligodendrocytes, endothelial cells, and stromal cells.We demonstrate the utility of our method by applying it to data on normal tissues from various brain regions and in aging and diseased tissues, including Alzheimer's disease, autism, Huntington's disease, epilepsy, and schizophrenia.We expect that the ability to determine the cellular composition in the brain using only DNA from bulk samples will accelerate understanding brain cell type composition and cell-type-specific epigenetic states in normal and diseased brain tissues.Copyright © 2023 Zhang, Wiencke, Kelsey, Koestler, Molinaro, Pike, Karra, Christensen and Salas."
"37510235","Single-Cell Analysis in the Omics Era: Technologies and Applications in Cancer.","Genes (Basel)","Cancer molecular profiling obtained with conventional bulk sequencing describes average alterations obtained from the entire cellular population analyzed. In the era of precision medicine, this approach is unable to track tumor heterogeneity and cannot be exploited to unravel the biological processes behind clonal evolution. In the last few years, functional single-cellomicshas improved our understanding of cancer heterogeneity. This approach requires isolation and identification of single cells starting from an entire population. A cell suspension obtained by tumor tissue dissociation or hematological material can be manipulated using different techniques to separate individual cells, employed for single-cell downstream analysis. Single-cell data can then be used to analyze cell-cell diversity, thus mapping evolving cancer biological processes. Despite its unquestionable advantages, single-cell analysis produces massive amounts of data with several potential biases, stemming from cell manipulation and pre-amplification steps. To overcome these limitations, several bioinformatic approaches have been developed and explored. In this work, we provide an overview of this entire process while discussing the most recent advances in the field of functionalomicsat single-cell resolution."
"37446021","Exploring the Role of Enhancer-Mediated Transcriptional Regulation in Precision Biology.","Int J Mol Sci","The emergence of precision biology has been driven by the development of advanced technologies and techniques in high-resolution biological research systems. Enhancer-mediated transcriptional regulation, a complex network of gene expression and regulation in eukaryotes, has attracted significant attention as a promising avenue for investigating the underlying mechanisms of biological processes and diseases. To address biological problems with precision, large amounts of data, functional information, and research on the mechanisms of action of biological molecules is required to address biological problems with precision. Enhancers, including typical enhancers and super enhancers, play a crucial role in gene expression and regulation within this network. The identification and targeting of disease-associated enhancers hold the potential to advance precision medicine. In this review, we present the concepts, progress, importance, and challenges in precision biology, transcription regulation, and enhancers. Furthermore, we propose a model of transcriptional regulation for multi-enhancers and provide examples of their mechanisms in mammalian cells, thereby enhancing our understanding of how enhancers achieve precise regulation of gene expression in life processes. Precision biology holds promise in providing new tools and platforms for discovering insights into gene expression and disease occurrence, ultimately benefiting individuals and society as a whole."
"37500973","Multi-omic rejuvenation and life span extension on exposure to youthful circulation.","Nat Aging","Heterochronic parabiosis (HPB) is known for its functional rejuvenation effects across several mouse tissues. However, its impact on biological age and long-term health is unknown. Here we performed extended (3-month) HPB, followed by a 2-month detachment period of anastomosed pairs. Old detached mice exhibited improved physiological parameters and lived longer than control isochronic mice. HPB drastically reduced the epigenetic age of blood and liver based on several clock models using two independent platforms. Remarkably, this rejuvenation effect persisted even after 2 months of detachment. Transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles of anastomosed mice showed an intermediate phenotype between old and young, suggesting a global multi-omic rejuvenation effect. In addition, old HPB mice showed gene expression changes opposite to aging but akin to several life span-extending interventions. Altogether, we reveal that long-term HPB results in lasting epigenetic and transcriptome remodeling, culminating in the extension of life span and health span.© 2023.

These structures play crucial roles in regulating gene expression, cell differentiation, and disease progression. Deciphering the principles underlying 3D genome folding and the molecular mechanisms governing cell fate determination remains a challenge. With advancements in high-throughput sequencing and imaging techniques, the hierarchical organization and functional roles of higher-order chromatin structures have been gradually illuminated. This review systematically discussed the structural hierarchy of the 3D genome, the effects and mechanisms of cis-regulatory elements interaction in the 3D genome for regulating spatiotemporally specific gene expression, the roles and mechanisms of dynamic changes in 3D chromatin conformation during embryonic development, and the pathological mechanisms of diseases such as congenital developmental abnormalities and cancer, which are attributed to alterations in 3D genome organization and aberrations in key structural proteins. Finally, prospects were made for the research about 3D genome structure, function, and genetic intervention, and the roles in disease development, prevention, and treatment, which may offer some clues for precise diagnosis and treatment of related diseases.© 2023 The Authors.

"37425846","Joint profiling of multiplex chromatin interactions, gene expression, and RNA-chromatin associations in single cells of the human brain.","bioRxiv","The dynamically organized chromatin complexes often involve multiplex chromatin interactions and sometimes chromatin-associated RNA. Here, we introduce the Mu lti-Nucleic Acid Interaction Mapping in Si ngle C ell (MUSIC) technique to enable simultaneous profiling of multiplex chromatin interactions, gene expression, and RNA-chromatin associations within a single nucleus. We applied MUSIC to profile >9,000 single nuclei in the human frontal cortex. MUSIC-derived single-nucleus transcriptomes provide a comprehensive categorization of cortical cell types, subtypes, and cellular states. The genomic sequences of highly expressed genes frequently co-complex with their flanking genomic regions, forming Gene-Expression-Associated Stripes (GEAS), which exemplify the intricate coordination between transcription and chromatin architecture at the single-cell level. Additionally, we observed significant heterogeneity among female cortical cells in the association between the XIST long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and the X chromosome (XIST-chrX association, quantified as XAL). Cells with high XAL demonstrated a greater difference in spatial organization between the XIST-associated (Xi) and non-associated (Xa) X chromosomes compared to XAL-low cells. Notably, excitatory neurons displayed enrichment in XAL-high cells and exhibited a more pronounced disparity in spatial organization between Xi and Xa compared to other cell types. The MUSIC technique offers a powerful tool for future investigations into chromatin architecture and transcription at a cellular resolution within complex tissues."

Mendelian randomization (MR) is a genetic tool that is widely used to minimize confounding and reverse causation when identifying the causal effects of complex traits. In this study, we conducted an integrated multiple microarray analysis and large-scale plasma proteome MR analysis to identify candidate biomarkers and evaluate the causal effects of prospective therapeutic targets in DN.Five DN gene expression datasets were selected from the Gene Expression Omnibus. The robust rank aggregation (RRA) method was used to integrate differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of glomerular samples between patients with DN and controls, followed by functional enrichment analysis. Protein quantitative trait loci were incorporated from seven different proteomic genome-wide association studies, and genetic association data on DN were obtained from FinnGen (3676 cases and 283,456 controls) for two-sample MR analysis. External validation and clinical correlation were also conducted.A total of 82 DEGs (53 upregulated and 29 downregulated) were identified through RRA integrated analysis. The enriched Gene Ontology annotations and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways of the DEGs were significantly enriched in neutrophil degranulation, neutrophil activation, proteoglycan binding, collagen binding, secretory granule lumen, gluconeogenesis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and pentose phosphate pathways. MR analysis revealed that the genetically predicted levels of MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence B (MICB), granzyme A (GZMA), cathepsin S (CTSS), chloride intracellular channel protein 5, and ficolin-1 (FCN1) were causally associated with DN risk. Expression validation and clinical correlation analysis showed that MICB, GZMA, FCN1, and insulin-like growth factor 1 may participate in the development of DN, and carbonic anhydrase 2 and lipoprotein lipase may play protective roles in patients with DN.Our integrated analysis identified novel biomarkers, including MICB and GZMA, which may help further understand the complicated mechanisms of DN and identify new target pathways for intervention.Copyright © 2023 Fan, Gao and Sun."

Traditional research methods have limitations in replicating its intricacies, necessitating the development of in vitro models that can simulate its structure and function. Three-dimensional in vitro models, including organoids, cerebral organoids, bioprinted brain models, and functionalized brain organoids, offer promising platforms for studying human brain development, physiology, and disease. These models accurately replicate key aspects of human brain anatomy, gene expression, and cellular behavior, enabling drug discovery and toxicology studies while providing insights into human-specific phenomena not easily studied in animal models. The use of human-induced pluripotent stem cells has revolutionized the generation of 3D brain structures, with various techniques developed to generate specific brain regions. These advancements facilitate the study of brain structure development and function, overcoming previous limitations due to the scarcity of human brain samples.

"37364131","Antisense oligonucleotide rescue of CGG expansion-dependent FMR1 mis-splicing in fragile X syndrome restores FMRP.","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","Aberrant alternative splicing of mRNAs results in dysregulated gene expression in multiple neurological disorders. Here, we show that hundreds of mRNAs are incorrectly expressed and spliced in white blood cells and brain tissues of individuals with fragile X syndrome (FXS). Surprisingly, theFMR1 (Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein 1)gene is transcribed in >70% of the FXS tissues. In allFMR1-expressing FXS tissues,FMR1RNA itself is mis-spliced in a CGG expansion-dependent manner to generate the little-knownFMR1-217 RNA isoform, which is comprised ofFMR1exon 1 and a pseudo-exon in intron 1.FMR1-217 is also expressed in FXS premutation carrier-derived skin fibroblasts and brain tissues. We show that in cells aberrantly expressing mis-splicedFMR1, antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) treatment reducesFMR1-217, rescues full-lengthFMR1RNA, and restores FMRP (Fragile X Messenger RibonucleoProtein) to normal levels. Notably,FMR1gene reactivation in transcriptionally silent FXS cells using 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AzadC), which prevents DNA methylation, increasesFMR1-217 RNA levels but not FMRP. ASO treatment of cells prior to 5-AzadC application rescues full-lengthFMR1expression and restores FMRP. These findings indicate that misregulated RNA-processing events in blood could serve as potent biomarkers for FXS and that in those individuals expressingFMR1-217, ASO treatment may offer a therapeutic approach to mitigate the disorder."

However, few to no studies have evaluated patients for CRS using objective testing and workup protocols that fulfill guidelines for CRS diagnostic criteria. Furthermore, no study, to our knowledge, has investigated the risks of CRS in the context of residential exposure through proximity to a commercial pesticide application site.To evaluate associations of residential proximity to a commercial pesticide application site and the prevalence of CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) and without nasal polyps (CRSwoNP).This was a retrospective cohort study of patients who presented to a tertiary care institution for rhinology evaluation between March 1, 2018, and December 31, 2022.The outcome variable was the clinical diagnosis of CRS (CRSwNP, CRSwoNP, or non-CRS control). Patients' residential addresses were utilized to determine pesticide exposure status based on a validated computational geographic information algorithm based on data from the California Pesticide Use Report System. The dichotomous independent variable of exposure status (exposed or non-exposed) was determined by assessing reports of any pesticide applications within 2000 m of each participant's residence in 2017. Multivariable logistic regressions assessing CRS status and CRS subtypes were conducted with pesticide exposure as the primary covariate of interest. The primary study outcome and measurements as well as study hypothesis were all formulated before data collection.Among a total of 310 patients (90 CRSwNP, 90 CRSwoNP, and 130 control), the mean (SD) age was 50 (17) years; 164 (53%) were female. Race and ethnicity information was not considered. Controlling for patient demographic information, smoking history, county of residence, and medical comorbidities, pesticide exposure was associated with an approximately 2.5-fold increase in odds of CRS (adjusted odds ratio, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.49-3.90). Pesticide exposure was associated with similar risks for CRSwNP (adjusted relative risk ratio [aRRR], 2.34; 95% CI, 1.31-4.18) and CRSwoNP (aRRR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.37-4.30).The findings of this retrospective cohort study and analysis revealed that residential exposure to commercial pesticide application within a 2000-m buffer was independently associated with an approximately 2.5-fold increase in odds of being diagnosed with CRS. If validated by additional research, this association would have substantial implications for public health."
"37345795","Social Determinants of Health and Cerebral Small Vessel Disease: Is Epigenetics a Key Mediator?","J Am Heart Assoc","Cerebral small vessel disease is highly prevalent, particularly in marginalized communities, and its incidence is expected to increase given the aging global population. Cerebral small vessel disease contributes to risk for stroke, vascular cognitive impairment and dementia, late-life depression, and gait disorders. A growing body of evidence suggests that adverse outcomes, including cerebral small vessel disease, caused by traditional cardiovascular risk factors are at least partly mediated by epigenetic changes, some of them already beginning during fetal development. Societal and health care access inequities, summarized under the umbrella term social determinants of health, put a higher burden of cardiovascular risk factors on marginalized populations and expose them to an increased risk for adverse outcomes. Social epigenetics has begun to deliver solid evidence that social determinants of health lead to distinct epigenetic signatures that potentially mediate the biological effect of environmental exposures on cardiovascular risk factors. Here, we provide a review of the most recent advances in the epigenetics of cerebral small vessel disease risk factors and social determinants of health and call for research efforts combining insights from both fields to reach a deeper understanding of the causal pathways, ultimately facilitating discovery of new treatment targets for a disease whose burden is magnified by existing health disparities."

Circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) has been proposed as an early diagnostic biomarker. However, as a screening tool, ctDNA has mainly been studied in selected populations at the time of clinical diagnosis. The aim of this study was to detect CRC by known ctDNA markers up to 2 years prior to clinical diagnosis.In this case-control study, methylated ctDNA markers were detected in plasma samples from 106 healthy controls and 106 individuals diagnosed with CRC within 24 months following participation in The Trøndelag Health Study.The most specific single markers were BMP3, FLI1, IKZF1, SFRP1, SFRP2, NPTX2, SLC8A1 and VIM (specificity >70%). When combining these into a panel, the CRC sensitivity was 43% (95% CI 42.7-43.4) and the CRC specificity was 86% (95% CI 85.7-86.2). The findings were reproduced in an independent validation set of samples.Detection of known methylated ctDNA markers of CRC is possible up to 2 years prior to the clinical diagnosis in an unselected population resembling the screening setting. This study supports the hypothesis that some patients could be diagnosed earlier, if ctDNA detection was part of the CRC screening programme.© 2023. The Author(s)."

While the relevance of the syndrome is gaining awareness, much remains unclear about its underlying biology. Further elucidation of the genetic determinants and possible underlying mechanisms may help improve patients' outcomes allowing healthy aging.Genotype, clinical and demographic data of subjects (aged 60-73 years) from UK Biobank were utilized. FP was defined on Fried's criteria. FI was calculated using electronic-health-records. Genome-wide-association-studies (GWAS) were conducted and polygenic-risk-scores (PRS) were calculated for both FP and FI. Functional analysis provided interpretations of underlying biology. Finally, machine-learning (ML) models were trained using clinical, demographic and PRS towards identifying frail from non-frail individuals.Thirty-one loci were significantly associated with FI accounting for 12% heritability. Seventeen of those were known associations for body-mass-index, coronary diseases, cholesterol-levels, and longevity, while the rest were novel. Significant genes CDKN2B and APOE, previously implicated in aging, were reported to be enriched in lipoprotein-particle-remodeling. Linkage-disequilibrium-regression identified specific regulation in limbic-system, associated with long-term memory and cognitive-function. XGboost was established as the best performing ML model with area-under-curve as 85%, sensitivity and specificity as 0.75 and 0.8, respectively.This study provides novel insights into increased vulnerability and risk stratification of frailty syndrome via a multi-modal approach. The findings suggest frailty as a highly polygenic-trait, enriched in cholesterol-remodeling and metabolism and to be genetically associated with cognitive abilities.

We conducted a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) with the new Genotype-Tissue Expression version 8 reference panels, including some tissue and multi-tissue panels that were not used previously. We performed tissue-specific heritability analyses on genome-wide association study data to prioritize the tissue panels for TWAS analysis. TWAS and colocalization (COLOC) analyses were performed with eight tissues from the single-tissue panels and the multi-tissue panels of context-specific genetics (CONTENT) to increase tissue specificity and statistical power. From TWAS, we identified the significant associations of 101 genes in the single-tissue panels and 64 genes in the multi-tissue panels, of which 26 genes were replicated in the COLOC. Functional annotation and network analyses identified that the genes were associated with psoriasis and/or immune responses. We also suggested drug candidates that interact with jointly significant genes through a conditional and joint analysis. Together, our findings may contribute to revealing the underlying genetic mechanisms and provide new insights into treatments for psoriasis."

We generated matched single-cell chromatin profiles and transcriptomes from scalp tissue from healthy controls and patients with alopecia areata, identifying diverse cell types of the hair follicle niche. By interrogating these datasets at multiple levels of cellular resolution, we infer 50-100% more enhancer-gene links than previous approaches and show that aggregate enhancer accessibility for highly regulated genes predicts expression. We use these gene-regulatory maps to prioritize cell types, genes and causal variants implicated in the pathobiology of androgenetic alopecia (AGA), eczema and other complex traits. AGA genome-wide association studies signals are enriched in dermal papilla regulatory regions, supporting the role of these cells as drivers of AGA pathogenesis.

However, our ability to translate these associations into insights on the disease mechanisms has been challenging since the causal genetic variants, their molecular function and their target genes remain largely unknown. In order to address these questions, we established a functional genomics pipeline in combination with induced pluripotent stem cell technology to functionally characterize ~35,000 non-coding genetic variants associated with schizophrenia along with their target genes. This analysis identified a set of 620 (1.7%) single nucleotide polymorphisms as functional on a molecular level in a highly cell type and condition specific fashion. These results provide a high-resolution map of functional variant-gene combinations and offer comprehensive biological insights into the developmental context and stimulation dependent molecular processes modulated by SCZ associated genetic variation."

Here, we present the results of mapping interaction QTLs (iQTLs) for cell type, age, and other phenotypic variables in multi-omic, longitudinal data from blood of individuals of diverse ancestries. By modeling the interaction between genotype and estimated cell type proportions, we demonstrate that cell type iQTLs could be considered as proxies for cell type-specific QTL effects. The interpretation of age iQTLs, however, warrants caution as the moderation effect of age on the genotype and molecular phenotype association may be mediated by changes in cell type composition. Finally, we show that cell type iQTLs contribute to cell type-specific enrichment of diseases that, in combination with additional functional data, may guide future functional studies. Overall, this study highlights iQTLs to gain insights into the context-specificity of regulatory effects."
"37418505","A flexible empirical Bayes approach to multivariate multiple regression, and its improved accuracy in predicting multi-tissue gene expression from genotypes.","PLoS Genet","Predicting phenotypes from genotypes is a fundamental task in quantitative genetics. With technological advances, it is now possible to measure multiple phenotypes in large samples. Multiple phenotypes can share their genetic component; therefore, modeling these phenotypes jointly may improve prediction accuracy by leveraging effects that are shared across phenotypes. However, effects can be shared across phenotypes in a variety of ways, so computationally efficient statistical methods are needed that can accurately and flexibly capture patterns of effect sharing. Here, we describe new Bayesian multivariate, multiple regression methods that, by using flexible priors, are able to model and adapt to different patterns of effect sharing and specificity across phenotypes. Simulation results show that these new methods are fast and improve prediction accuracy compared with existing methods in a wide range of settings where effects are shared. Further, in settings where effects are not shared, our methods still perform competitively with state-of-the-art methods. In real data analyses of expression data in the Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, our methods improve prediction performance on average for all tissues, with the greatest gains in tissues where effects are strongly shared, and in the tissues with smaller sample sizes. While we use gene expression prediction to illustrate our methods, the methods are generally applicable to any multi-phenotype applications, including prediction of polygenic scores and breeding values. Thus, our methods have the potential to provide improvements across fields and organisms.Copyright: © 2023 Morgante et al.

To identify novel genes associated with migraine and interpret the transcriptional products of those genes, we conducted a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS). We performed tissue-specific and multi-tissue TWAS analyses to assess associations between imputed gene expression from 53 tissues and migraine susceptibility using FUSION software. Meta-analyzed GWAS summary statistics from 26,052 migraine cases and 487,214 controls, all of European ancestry and from two cohorts (the Kaiser Permanente GERA and the UK Biobank), were used. We evaluated the associations for genes after conditioning on variant-level effects from GWAS, and we tested for colocalization of GWAS migraine-associated loci and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). Across tissue-specific and multi-tissue analyses, we identified 53 genes for which genetically predicted gene expression was associated with migraine after correcting for multiple testing. Of these 53 genes, 10 (ATF5,CNTNAP1,KTN1-AS1,NEIL1,NEK4,NNT,PNKP,RUFY2,TUBG2, andVAT1) did not overlap known migraine-associated loci identified from GWAS. Tissue-specific analysis identified 45 gene-tissue pairs and cardiovascular tissues represented the highest proportion of the Bonferroni-significant gene-tissue pairs (n = 22 [49%]), followed by brain tissues (n = 6 [13%]), and gastrointestinal tissues (n = 4 [9%]). Colocalization analyses provided evidence of shared genetic variants underlying eQTL and GWAS signals in 18 of the gene-tissue pairs (40%). Our TWAS reports novel genes for migraine and highlights the important contribution of brain, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal tissues in migraine susceptibility.© 2023 The Author(s)."
"37414898","A prognostic risk score for development and spread of chronic pain.","Nat Med","Chronic pain is a complex condition influenced by a combination of biological, psychological and social factors. Using data from the UK Biobank (n = 493,211), we showed that pain spreads from proximal to distal sites and developed a biopsychosocial model that predicted the number of coexisting pain sites. This data-driven model was used to identify a risk score that classified various chronic pain conditions (area under the curve (AUC) 0.70-0.88) and pain-related medical conditions (AUC 0.67-0.86). In longitudinal analyses, the risk score predicted the development of widespread chronic pain, the spreading of chronic pain across body sites and high-impact pain about 9 years later (AUC 0.68-0.78). Key risk factors included sleeplessness, feeling 'fed-up', tiredness, stressful life events and a body mass index >30. A simplified version of this score, named the risk of pain spreading, obtained similar predictive performance based on six simple questions with binarized answers. The risk of pain spreading was then validated in the Northern Finland Birth Cohort (n = 5,525) and the PREVENT-AD cohort (n = 178), obtaining comparable predictive performance. Our findings show that chronic pain conditions can be predicted from a common set of biopsychosocial factors, which can aid in tailoring research protocols, optimizing patient randomization in clinical trials and improving pain management.© 2023.

Height has therefore been commonly used to make observations later generalised to other phenotypes though the appropriateness of such generalisations is not always considered.We aimed to assess height's suitability as a model for other complex phenotypes and review recent advances in height genetics with regard to their implications for complex phenotypes more broadly.We conducted a comprehensive literature search in PubMed and Google Scholar for articles relevant to the genetics of height and its comparatibility to other phenotypes.Height is broadly similar to other phenotypes apart from its high heritability and ease of measurment. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 12,000 independent signals associated with height and saturated height's common single nucleotide polymorphism based heritability of height within a subset of the genome in individuals similar to European reference populations.Given the similarity of height to other complex traits, the saturation of GWAS's ability to discover additional height-associated variants signals potential limitations to the omnigenic model of complex-phenotype inheritance, indicating the likely future power of polygenic scores and risk scores, and highlights the increasing need for large-scale variant-to-gene mapping efforts."

Linkage disequilibrium score regression in specifically expressed genes and multimarker analysis of GenoMic annotation was utilised to explore single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) enrichment at the tissue and cell-type levels. Shared risk SNPs were derived using cross-trait meta-analyses and Heritability Estimation from Summary Statistics. We explored the potential functional genes using summary-data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR). The expression profiles of the risk gene in tissues were further examined.We found a significantly positive genetic correlation between BMI and MS, and the causal association of BMI with MS was supported (β = 0.22, P = 8.03E-05). Cross-trait analysis yielded 39 shared risk SNPs, and the risk gene GGNBP2 was consistently identified in SMR. We observed tissue-specific level SNP heritability enrichment for BMI mainly in brain tissues for MS in immune-related tissues, and cell-type-specific level SNP heritability enrichment in 12 different immune cell types in brain, spleen, lung, and whole blood. The expressions of GGNBP2 were significantly altered in the tissues of patients with obesity or MS compared to those of control subjects.Our study indicates the genetic correlation and shared risk genes between obesity and MS. These findings provide insights into the potential mechanisms behind their comorbidity and the future development of therapeutics.This work was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (82171698, 82170561, 81300279, and 81741067), the Program for High-level Foreign Expert Introduction of China (G2022030047L), the Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars of Guangdong Province (2021B1515020003), Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province (2022A1515012081), the Foreign Distinguished Teacher Program of Guangdong Science and Technology Department (KD0120220129), the Climbing Programme of Introduced Talents and High-level Hospital Construction Project of Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital (DFJH201803, KJ012019099, KJ012021143, and KY012021183), and in part by VA Clinical Merit and ASGE clinical research funds (FWL).Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

Altered methylation of ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 1 (ABCG1) has been implicated in CHD but was mostly studied in Caucasians. Exploring the potential relationship between ABCG1 methylation in blood and CHD among the Chinese population would yield valuable insights.Peripheral blood samples were obtained from a case-control study (287 CHD patients vs. 277 controls) and a prospective nested case-control study (171 CHD patients and 197 matched controls). DNA extraction and bisulfite-specific PCR amplification techniques were employed for sample processing. Quantitative assessment of methylation levels was conducted using mass spectrometry. Statistical analyses involved the utilization of logistic regression and nonparametric tests.We found hypomethylation of ABCG1 in whole blood was associated with the risk of CHD in both studies, which was enhanced in heart failure (HF) patients, female and younger subjects. When combined with baseline characteristics, altered ABCG1 methylation showed improved predictive effect for differentiating CHD cases, ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) cases, younger than 60 years CHD cases, and female CHD cases from healthy controls (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.68, 0.71, 0.74, and 0.73, respectively).We demonstrated a robust link between ABCG1 hypomethylation in whole blood and CHD risk in the Chinese population and provided novel evidence indicating that aberrant ABCG1 methylation in peripheral blood can serve as an early detection biomarker for CHD patients.© 2023.

The uric acid, TG, TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, apolipoprotein A1, free fatty acid, lipoprotein a, homocysteine, CRP, and SAA levels were examined. The levels of METTL14, TNF-α, MCP-1, VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and IL-6 were evaluated by ELISA.Patients with CHD had significantly higher m6A methyltransferase activity. In addition, the incidence of diabetes and hypertension, as well as the concentrations of TC, CRP, and SAA were higher in CHD patients. Patients with coronary lesion branches also had significantly increased TG, LDL-C, CRP, and SAA levels. TNF-α, MCP-1, VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and IL-6 expression was also markedly increased in the CHD group (P < 0.001) as was the expression of METTL14 (P < 0.001). The METTL14 expression levels also differed significantly in relation to the number of branches with lesions (P < 0.01) and were correlated with SAA, VCAM-1, ICAM-1, IL-6, and the Gensini score. ROC curve analyses of METTL14 in CHD indicated an AUC of 0.881 (0.679, 0.894) with a cut-off value of 342.37, a sensitivity of 77%, and a specificity of 84%. MCP-1, VCAM-1, IL-6, SAA, and METTL14 were found to independently predict CHD risk.METTL14 levels were found to be positively associated with inflammatory markers and to be an independent predictor of CHD risk.© 2023 Guo, He, Hu and Li."
"37500827","Trans-ancestry meta-analysis of genome wide association studies of inhibitory control.","Mol Psychiatry","Deficits in effective executive function, including inhibitory control are associated with risk for a number of psychiatric disorders and significantly impact everyday functioning. These complex traits have been proposed to serve as endophenotypes, however, their genetic architecture is not yet well understood. To identify the common genetic variation associated with inhibitory control in the general population we performed the first trans-ancestry genome wide association study (GWAS) combining data across 8 sites and four ancestries (N = 14,877) using cognitive traits derived from the stop-signal task, namely - go reaction time (GoRT), go reaction time variability (GoRT SD) and stop signal reaction time (SSRT). Although we did not identify genome wide significant associations for any of the three traits, GoRT SD and SSRT demonstrated significant and similar SNP heritability of 8.2%, indicative of an influence of genetic factors. Power analyses demonstrated that the number of common causal variants contributing to the heritability of these phenotypes is relatively high and larger sample sizes are necessary to robustly identify associations. In Europeans, the polygenic risk for ADHD was significantly associated with GoRT SD and the polygenic risk for schizophrenia was associated with GoRT, while in East Asians polygenic risk for schizophrenia was associated with SSRT. These results support the potential of executive function measures as endophenotypes of neuropsychiatric disorders. Together these findings provide the first evidence indicating the influence of common genetic variation in the genetic architecture of inhibitory control quantified using objective behavioural traits derived from the stop-signal task.© 2023.

"37448981","Bridging the diversity gap: Analytical and study design considerations for improving the accuracy of trans-ancestry genetic prediction.","HGG Adv","Genetic prediction of common complex disease risk is an essential component of precision medicine. Currently, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are mostly composed of European-ancestry samples and resulting polygenic scores (PGSs) have been shown to poorly transfer to other ancestries partly due to heterogeneity of allelic effects between populations. Fixed-effects (FETA) and random-effects (RETA) trans-ancestry meta-analyses do not model such ancestry-related heterogeneity, while ancestry-specific (AS) scores may suffer from low power due to low sample sizes. In contrast, trans-ancestry meta-regression (TAMR) builds ancestry-aware PGS that account for more complex trans-ancestry architectures. Here, we examine the predictive performance of these four PGSs under multiple genetic architectures and ancestry configurations. We show that the predictive performance of FETA and RETA is strongly affected by cross-ancestry genetic heterogeneity, while AS PGS performance decreases in under-represented target populations. TAMR PGS is also impacted by heterogeneity but maintains good prediction performance in most situations, especially in ancestry-diverse scenarios. In simulations of human complex traits, TAMR scores currently explain 25% more phenotypic variance than AS in triglyceride levels and 33% more phenotypic variance than FETA in type 2 diabetes in most non-European populations. Importantly, a high proportion of non-European-ancestry individuals is needed to reach prediction levels that are comparable in those populations to the one observed in European-ancestry studies. Our results highlight the need to rebalance the ancestral composition of GWAS to enable accurate prediction in non-European-ancestry groups, and demonstrate the relevance of meta-regression approaches for compensating some of the current population biases in GWAS.© 2023 The Author(s)."

We identified 38,270 independent variants associating with one or more traits at experiment-wide (P < 4.6x10-11) significance; fine-mapping 6,318 signals identified from 613 traits to single-variant resolution. Among these, a third (2,069) of the associations were found only among participants genetically similar to non-European reference populations, demonstrating the importance of expanding diversity in genetic studies.

"37419925","Optimal strategies for learning multi-ancestry polygenic scores vary across traits.","Nat Commun","Polygenic scores (PGSs) are individual-level measures that aggregate the genome-wide genetic predisposition to a given trait. As PGS have predominantly been developed using European-ancestry samples, trait prediction using such European ancestry-derived PGS is less accurate in non-European ancestry individuals. Although there has been recent progress in combining multiple PGS trained on distinct populations, the problem of how to maximize performance given a multiple-ancestry cohort is largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the effect of sample size and ancestry composition on PGS performance for fifteen traits in UK Biobank. For some traits, PGS estimated using a relatively small African-ancestry training set outperformed, on an African-ancestry test set, PGS estimated using a much larger European-ancestry only training set. We observe similar, but not identical, results when considering other minority-ancestry groups within UK Biobank. Our results emphasise the importance of targeted data collection from underrepresented groups in order to address existing disparities in PGS performance.© 2023. The Author(s)."

AIS is also known as a complex disease involved in environmental and genetic factors. A relation between AIS and body mass index (BMI) has been epidemiologically and genetically suggested. However, the causal relationship between AIS and BMI remains to be elucidated.Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of AIS (Japanese cohort, 5,327 cases, 73,884 controls; US cohort: 1,468 cases, 20,158 controls) and BMI (Biobank Japan: 173430 individual; meta-analysis of genetic investigation of anthropometric traits and UK Biobank: 806334 individuals; European Children cohort: 39620 individuals; Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology: 49335 individuals). In MR analyses evaluating the effect of BMI on AIS, the association between BMI and AIS summary statistics was evaluated using the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method, weighted median method, and Egger regression (MR-Egger) methods in Japanese.Significant causality of genetically decreased BMI on risk of AIS was estimated: IVW method (Estimate (beta) [SE] = -0.56 [0.16], p = 1.8 × 10-3), weighted median method (beta = -0.56 [0.18], p = 8.5 × 10-3) and MR-Egger method (beta = -1.50 [0.43], p = 4.7 × 10-3), respectively. Consistent results were also observed when using the US AIS summary statistic in three MR methods; however, no significant causality was observed when evaluating the effect of AIS on BMI.Our Mendelian randomization analysis using large studies of AIS and GWAS for BMI summary statistics revealed that genetic variants contributing to low BMI have a causal effect on the onset of AIS. This result was consistent with those of epidemiological studies and would contribute to the early detection of AIS.Copyright © 2023 Otomo, Khanshour, Koido, Takeda, Momozawa, Kubo, Kamatani, Herring, Ogura, Takahashi, Minami, Uno, Kawakami, Ito, Sato, Watanabe, Kaito, Yanagida, Taneichi, Harimaya, Taniguchi, Shigematsu, Iida, Demura, Sugawara, Fujita, Yagi, Okada, Hosogane, Kono, Nakamura, Chiba, Kotani, Sakuma, Akazawa, Suzuki, Nishida, Kakutani, Tsuji, Sudo, Iwata, Inami, Wise, Kochi, Matsumoto, Ikegawa, Watanabe and Terao."
"37524978","The medial preoptic area mediates depressive-like behaviors induced by ovarian hormone withdrawal through distinct GABAergic projections.","Nat Neurosci","Fluctuations in reproductive hormone levels are associated with mood disruptions in women, such as in postpartum and perimenopausal depression. However, the neural circuit mechanisms remain unclear. Here we report that medial preoptic area (MPOA) GABAergic neurons mediate multifaceted depressive-like behaviors in female mice after ovarian hormone withdrawal (HW), which can be attributed to downregulation of activity in Esr1 (estrogen receptor-1)-expressing GABAergic neurons. Enhancing activity of these neurons ameliorates depressive-like behaviors in HW-treated mice, whereas reducing their activity results in expression of these behaviors. Two separate subpopulations mediate different symptoms: a subpopulation projecting to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) mediates anhedonia and another projecting to the periaqueductal gray mediates immobility. These projections enhance activity of dopaminergic neurons in the VTA and serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe, respectively, with increased release of dopamine and serotonin, possibly through disinhibition mechanisms. Thus, the MPOA is a hub that mediates depressive-like behaviors resulting from transitions in reproductive hormone levels.© 2023.

The dataset contained 27 predictor variables and one dependent variable which referred to the status of employees (normal or at the risk of depression). The prediction accuracy of three machine learning models using sparse logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest was compared with the accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC. Additionally, the important factors identifiedviasparse logistic regression and random forest.All machine learning models demonstrated similar results, with the lowest accuracy obtained from sparse logistic regression and support vector machine (86.8%) and the highest accuracy from random forest (88.7%). The important factors identified in this study were gender, physical health, job, psychosocial protective factors, and psychosocial risk and protective factors in the workplace.The results of this study indicated the potential of machine learning models to accurately predict the risk of depression among employees. The identified factors that influence the risk of depression can contribute to the development of intelligent mental healthcare systems that can detect early signs of depressive symptoms in the workplace.Copyright © 2023 Kim, Gil and Min."

In this study, the effect of cumulative ACEs experienced on human maternal DNA methylation (DNAm) was estimated while accounting for interaction with domains of ACEs in prenatal peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from the Maternal and Developmental Risks from Environmental Stressors (MADRES) pregnancy cohort. The intergenerational transmission of ACE-associated DNAm was also explored used paired maternal and neonatal cord blood samples. Replication in buccal samples was explored in the Children's Health Study (CHS). We used a four-level categorical indicator variable for ACEs exposure: none (0 ACEs), low (1-3 ACEs), moderate (4-6 ACEs), and high (> 6 ACEs). Effects of ACEs on maternal DNAm (N = 240) were estimated using linear models. To evaluate evidence for intergenerational transmission, mediation analysis was used. Analysis of maternal samples displayed some shared but mostly distinct effects of ACEs on DNAm across low, moderate, and high ACEs categories.CLCN7andPTPRN2was associated with maternal DNAm in the low ACE group and this association replicated in the CHS. ACE-associated methylation was observed in maternal and neonatal profiles in theCOMTpromoter region, with some evidence of mediation by maternalCOMTmethylation. Specific genomic loci exhibited mutually exclusive maternal ACE effects on DNAm in either maternal or neonatal population. There is some evidence for an intergenerational effect of ACEs, supported by shared DNAm signatures in theCOMTgene across maternal-neonatal paired samples."

From these we present here, pan-primate epigenetic clocks which are highly accurate for all primates including humans (age correlation R = 0.98). We also carried out in-depth analysis of baboon DNA methylation profiles and generated five epigenetic clocks for baboons (Olive-yellow baboon hybrid), one of which, the pan-tissue epigenetic clock, was trained on seven tissue types (fetal cerebral cortex, adult cerebral cortex, cerebellum, adipose, heart, liver, and skeletal muscle) with ages ranging from late fetal life to 22.8 years of age. Using the primate data, we characterize the effect of age and sex on individual cytosines in highly conserved regions. We identify 11 sex-related CpGs on autosomes near genes (POU3F2, CDYL, MYCL, FBXL4, ZC3H10, ZXDC, RRAS, FAM217A, RBM39, GRIA2, UHRF2). Low overlap can be observed between age- and sex-related CpGs.

Poor health and fertility are of great economical and animal welfare concern. Circulating miRNAs have been linked to several livestock traits, including resistance to infection, fertility, and muscle development. This study aimed to identify circulating miRNAs associated with early life performance traits and aging in dairy cattle. Plasma samples from female calves (n = 12) identified retrospectively as differing in health, growth, and fertility outcomes prior to first calving were analyzed using PCR arrays detecting 378 miRNAs. Levels of 6 miRNAs differed significantly in calves with poor growth/fertility relative to controls (t-test: P<0.05). Additionally, general(ized) (non)linear mixed models identified 1 miRNA associated with average daily gain until weaning, 22 with live bodyweight at one year of age, 47 with age at first service, and 19 with number of infections before first calving. Out of 85 distinct miRNAs that were associated with at least one animal trait, 9 miRNAs were validated by RT-qPCR in a larger cohort (n = 91 animals), which included longitudinal plasma samples (calf, heifer, first lactation cow). Significant associations (P<0.05) involving individual miRNAs or ratios between miRNAs and early-life performance traits were identified, but did not retain significance after multiple testing adjustment. However, levels of 8 plasma miRNAs (miR-126-3p, miR-127, miR-142-5p, miR-154b, miR-27b, miR-30c-5p, miR-34a, miR-363) changed significantly with age, most prominently during the calf-to-heifer transition. Comparative RT-qPCR analyses of these miRNAs across 19 calf tissues showed that most were ubiquitously expressed. Online database mining identified several pathways involved in metabolism and cell signaling as putative biological targets of these miRNAs. These results suggest that miR-126-3p, miR-127, miR-142-5p, miR-154b, miR-27b, miR-30c-5p, miR-34a, miR-363 are involved in regulating growth and development from birth to first lactation (~2 years old) and could provide useful biomarkers of aging in cattle.Copyright: © 2023 MacLeay et al.

In contrast, the other virgin males display aggressive behaviors towards conspecific pups. However, little is known about the molecular underpinnings of this behavioral dichotomy, such as gene expression changes and their regulatory mechanisms. To address this, we profiled the transcriptome and DNA methylome of hippocampal dentate gyrus of four prairie vole groups, namely attacker virgin males, parental virgin males, fathers, and mothers. While we found a concordant gene expression pattern between parental virgin males and fathers, the attacker virgin males have a more deviated transcriptome. Moreover, numerous DNA methylation changes were found in pair-wise comparisons among the four groups. We found some DNA methylation changes overlapping with transcription differences, across gene-bodies and promoter regions. Furthermore, the gene expression changes and methylome alterations are selectively enriched in certain biological pathways, such as Wnt signaling, which suggest a canonical transcription regulatory role of DNA methylation in paternal behavior. Therefore, our study presents an integrated view of prairie vole dentate gyrus transcriptome and epigenome that provides a DNA epigenetic based molecular insight of paternal behavior.© 2023.

Analyses of epigenomic and transcriptomic modifications may help to dissect the biological factors underlying the gene-environment interplay in PTSD. To date, most human PTSD epigenetics studies have used peripheral tissue, and these findings have complex and poorly understood relationships to brain alterations. Studies examining brain tissue may help characterize the brain-specific transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles of PTSD. In this review, we compiled and integrated brain-specific molecular findings of PTSD from humans and animals.A systematic literature search according to the PRISMA criteria was performed to identify transcriptomic and epigenomic studies of PTSD, focusing on brain tissue from human postmortem samples or animal-stress paradigms.Gene- and pathway-level convergence analyses revealed PTSD-dysregulated genes and biological pathways across brain regions and species. A total of 243 genes converged across species, with 17 of them significantly enriched for PTSD. Chemical synaptic transmission and signaling by G-protein-coupled receptors were consistently enriched across omics and species.Our findings point out dysregulated genes highly replicated across PTSD studies in humans and animal models and suggest a potential role for the corticotropin-releasing hormone/orexin pathway in PTSD's pathophysiology.

Current approaches for calculating genetic risk to specific psychiatric conditions consist of aggregating genome-wide association studies-derived estimates into polygenic risk scores, which broadly represent the number of inherited risk alleles for an individual. While the traditional approach for polygenic risk score calculation aggregates estimates of gene-disease associations, novel alternative approaches have started to consider functional molecular phenotypes that are closer to genetic variation and are less penalized by the multiple testing required in genome-wide association studies. Moving the focus from genotype-disease to genotype-gene regulation frameworks, these novel approaches incorporate prior knowledge regarding biological processes involved in disease and aggregate estimates for the association of genotypes and phenotypes using multi-omics data modalities. In this review, we discuss and list different functional genomics tools that can be used and integrated to inform researchers and clinicians for a better understanding and diagnosis of psychopathology. We suggest that these novel approaches can help generate biologically driven hypotheses for polygenic signals that can ultimately serve the clinical community as potential biomarkers of psychiatric disease susceptibility.© 2022 The Authors."
"37461510","Naturally segregating genetic variants contribute to thermal tolerance in a D. melanogaste r model system.","bioRxiv","Thermal tolerance is a fundamental physiological complex trait for survival in many species. For example, everyday tasks such as foraging, finding a mate, and avoiding predation, are highly dependent on how well an organism can tolerate extreme temperatures. Understanding the general architecture of the natural variants of the genes that control this trait is of high importance if we want to better comprehend how this trait evolves in natural populations. Here, we take a multipronged approach to further dissect the genetic architecture that controls thermal tolerance in natural populations using the Drosophila Synthetic Population Resource (DSPR) as a model system. First, we used quantitative genetics and Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) mapping to identify major effect regions within the genome that influences thermal tolerance, then integrated RNA-sequencing to identify differences in gene expression, and lastly, we used the RNAi system to 1) alter tissue-specific gene expression and 2) functionally validate our findings. This powerful integration of approaches not only allows for the identification of the genetic basis of thermal tolerance but also the physiology of thermal tolerance in a natural population, which ultimately elucidates thermal tolerance through a fitness-associated lens."
"37461506","Spontaneous single-nucleotide substitutions and microsatellite mutations have distinct distributions of fitness effects.","bioRxiv","The fitness effects of new mutations determine key properties of evolutionary processes. Beneficial mutations drive evolution, yet selection is also shaped by the frequency of small-effect deleterious mutations, whose combined effect can burden otherwise adaptive lineages and alter evolutionary trajectories and outcomes in clonally evolving organisms such as viruses, microbes, and tumors. The small effect sizes of these important mutations have made accurate measurements of their rates difficult. In microbes, assessing the effect of mutations on growth can be especially instructive, as this complex phenotype is closely linked to fitness in clonally evolving organisms. Here, we perform high-throughput time-lapse microscopy on cells from mutation-accumulation strains to precisely infer the distribution of mutational effects on growth rate in the budding yeast,Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that mutational effects on growth rate are overwhelmingly negative, highly skewed towards very small effect sizes, and frequent enough to suggest that deleterious hitchhikers may impose a significant burden on evolving lineages. By using lines that accumulated mutations in either wild-type or slippage repair-defective backgrounds, we further disentangle the effects of two common types of mutations, single-nucleotide substitutions and simple sequence repeat indels, and show that they have distinct effects on yeast growth rate. Although the average effect of a simple sequence repeat mutation is very small (~0.3%), many do alter growth rate, implying that this class of frequent mutations has an important evolutionary impact."
"37456666","COVID-19 severity: does the genetic landscape of rare variants matter?","Front Genet","Rare variants affecting host defense against pathogens may be involved in COVID-19 severity, but most rare variants are not expected to have a major impact on the course of COVID-19. We hypothesized that the accumulation of weak effects of many rare functional variants throughout the exome may contribute to the overall risk in patients with severe disease. This assumption is consistent with the omnigenic model of the relationship between genetic and phenotypic variation in complex traits, according to which association signals tend to spread across most of the genome through gene regulatory networks from genes outside the major pathways to disease-related genes. We performed whole-exome sequencing and compared the burden of rare variants in 57 patients with severe and 29 patients with mild/moderate COVID-19. At the whole-exome level, we observed an excess of rare, predominantly high-impact (HI) variants in the group with severe COVID-19. Restriction to genes intolerant to HI or damaging missense variants increased enrichment for these classes of variants. Among various sets of genes, an increased signal of rare HI variants was demonstrated predominantly for primary immunodeficiency genes and the entire set of genes associated with immune diseases, as well as for genes associated with respiratory diseases. We advocate taking the ideas of the omnigenic model into account in COVID-19 studies.Copyright © 2023 Khadzhieva, Gracheva, Belopolskaya, Kolobkov, Kashatnikova, Redkin, Kuzovlev, Grechko and Salnikova."

The extant literature of the neurobiological underpinnings of physical symptoms is largely inconsistent and primarily comprises of (clinical) case-control studies with small sample sizes. In this cross-sectional study, we studied the association between dimensionally measured physical symptoms and brain morphology in pre-adolescents from two population-based cohorts; the Generation R Study (n = 2649, 10.1 ± 0.6 years old) and ABCD Study (n = 9637, 9.9 ± 0.6 years old). Physical symptoms were evaluated using continuous scores from the somatic complaints syndrome scale from the parent-reported Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). High-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was collected using 3-Tesla MRI systems. Linear regression models were fitted for global brain metrics (cortical and subcortical grey matter and total white matter volume) and surface-based vertex-wise measures (surface area and cortical thickness). Results were meta-analysed. Symptoms of anxiety/depression were studied as a contrasting comorbidity. In the meta-analyses across cohorts, we found negative associations between physical symptoms and surface area in the (i) left hemisphere; in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex and pars triangularis and (ii) right hemisphere; in the pars triangularis, the pars orbitalis, insula, middle temporal gyrus and caudal anterior cingulate cortex. However, only a subset of regions (left lateral orbitofrontal cortex and right pars triangularis) were specifically associated with physical symptoms, while others were also related to symptoms of anxiety/depression. No significant associations were observed for cortical thickness. This study in preadolescents, the most representative and well-powered to date, showed that more physical symptoms are modestly related to less surface area of the prefrontal cortex mostly.

"37425751","Novel mouse model of Weaver syndrome displays overgrowth and excess osteogenesis reversible with KDM6A/6B inhibition.","bioRxiv","Weaver syndrome is a Mendelian disorder of the epigenetic machinery (MDEM) caused by germline pathogenic variants inEZH2, which encodes the predominant H3K27 methyltransferase and key enzymatic component of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). Weaver syndrome is characterized by striking overgrowth and advanced bone age, intellectual disability, and distinctive facies. We generated a mouse model for the most common Weaver syndrome missense variant,EZH2p.R684C.Ezh2R684C/R684Cmouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) showed global depletion of H3K27me3.Ezh2R684C/+mice had abnormal bone parameters indicative of skeletal overgrowth, andEzh2R684C/+osteoblasts showed increased osteogenic activity. RNA-seq comparing osteoblasts differentiated fromEzh2R684C/+andEzh2+/+bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) indicated collective dysregulation of the BMP pathway and osteoblast differentiation. Inhibition of the opposing H3K27 demethylases Kdm6a/6b substantially reversed the excessive osteogenesis inEzh2R684C/+cells both at the transcriptional and phenotypic levels. This supports both the ideas that writers and erasers of histone marks exist in a fine balance to maintain epigenome state, and that epigenetic modulating agents have therapeutic potential for the treatment of MDEMs."
"37398186","Reassessing the modularity of gene co-expression networks using the Stochastic Block Model.","bioRxiv","Finding communities in gene co-expression networks is a common first step toward extracting biological insight from such complex datasets. Most community detection algorithms expect genes to be organized into assortative modules, that is, groups of genes that are more associated with each other than with genes in other groups. While it is reasonable to expect that these modules exist, using methods that assume they exist a priori is risky, as it guarantees that alternative organizations of gene interactions will be ignored. Here, we ask: can we find meaningful communities without imposing a modular organization on gene co-expression networks, and how modular are these communities? For this, we use a recently developed community detection method, the weighted degree corrected stochastic block model (SBM), that does not assume that assortative modules exist. Instead, the SBM attempts to efficiently use all information contained in the co-expression network to separate the genes into hierarchically organized blocks of genes. Using RNA-seq gene expression data measured in two tissues derived from an outbred population ofDrosophila melanogaster, we show that (a) the SBM is able to find ten times as many groups as competing methods, that (b) several of those gene groups are not modular, and that (c) the functional enrichment for non-modular groups is as strong as for modular communities. These results show that the transcriptome is structured in more complex ways than traditionally thought and that we should revisit the long-standing assumption that modularity is the main driver of the structuring of gene co-expression networks."
"37392472","Trans-Acting Genotypes Associated with mRNA Expression Affect Metabolic and Thermal Tolerance Traits.","Genome Biol Evol","Evolutionary processes driving physiological trait variation depend on the underlying genomic mechanisms. Evolution of these mechanisms depends on the genetic complexity (involving many genes) and how gene expression impacting the traits is converted to phenotype. Yet, genomic mechanisms that impact physiological traits are diverse and context dependent (e.g., vary by environment and tissues), making them difficult to discern. We examine the relationships between genotype, mRNA expression, and physiological traits to discern the genetic complexity and whether the gene expression affecting the physiological traits is primarily cis- or trans-acting. We use low-coverage whole genome sequencing and heart- or brain-specific mRNA expression to identify polymorphisms directly associated with physiological traits and expressed quantitative trait loci (eQTL) indirectly associated with variation in six temperature specific physiological traits (standard metabolic rate, thermal tolerance, and four substrate specific cardiac metabolic rates). Focusing on a select set of mRNAs belonging to co-expression modules that explain up to 82% of temperature specific traits, we identified hundreds of significant eQTL for mRNA whose expression affects physiological traits. Surprisingly, most eQTL (97.4% for heart and 96.7% for brain) were trans-acting. This could be due to higher effect size of trans- versus cis-acting eQTL for mRNAs that are central to co-expression modules. That is, we may have enhanced the identification of trans-acting factors by looking for single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with mRNAs in co-expression modules that broadly influence gene expression patterns. Overall, these data indicate that the genomic mechanism driving physiological variation across environments is driven by trans-acting heart- or brain-specific mRNA expression.© The Author(s) 2023.

"37333213","Jaw size variation is associated with a novel craniofacial function for galanin receptor 2 in an adaptive radiation of pupfishes.","bioRxiv","Understanding the genetic basis of novel adaptations in new species is a fundamental question in biology that also provides an opportunity to uncover new genes and regulatory networks with potential clinical relevance. Here we demonstrate a new role forgalr2in vertebrate craniofacial development using an adaptive radiation of trophic specialist pupfishes endemic to San Salvador Island in the Bahamas. We confirmed the loss of a putativeSrytranscription factor binding site in the upstream region ofgalr2in scale-eating pupfish and found significant spatial differences ingalr2expression among pupfish species in Meckel's cartilage and premaxilla using in situ hybridization chain reaction (HCR). We then experimentally demonstrated a novel function for Galr2 in craniofacial development and jaw elongation by exposing embryos to drugs that inhibit Galr2 activity. Galr2-inhibition reduced Meckel's cartilage length and increased chondrocyte density in both trophic specialists but not in the generalist genetic background. We propose a mechanism for jaw elongation in scale-eaters based on the reduced expression ofgalr2due to the loss of a putativeSrybinding site. Fewer Galr2 receptors in the scale-eater Meckel's cartilage may result in their enlarged jaw lengths as adults by limiting opportunities for a postulated Galr2 agonist to bind to these receptors during development. Our findings illustrate the growing utility of linking candidate adaptive SNPs in non-model systems with highly divergent phenotypes to novel vertebrate gene functions."

Here, by integrated analyses using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), spatial transcriptomics, and single-cell assay for transposase accessible chromatin sequencing (scATAC-seq) techniques, we uncovered the spatially resolved expression landscape and gene-regulatory network of human gastric corpus epithelium. Specifically, we identified a stem/progenitor cell population in the isthmus of human gastric corpus, where EGF and WNT signaling pathways were activated. Meanwhile, LGR4, but not LGR5, was responsible for the activation of WNT signaling pathway. Importantly, FABP5 and NME1 were identified and validated as crucial for both normal gastric stem/progenitor cells and gastric cancer cells. Finally, we explored the epigenetic regulation of critical genes for gastric corpus epithelium at chromatin state level, and identified several important cell-type-specific transcription factors. In summary, our work provides novel insights to systematically understand the cellular diversity and homeostasis of human gastric corpus epithelium in vivo.© The Author(s) 2022.

Although brain organoids mimic the human brain's cell-to-cell network interactions, they generally fail to faithfully recapitulate cell-to-matrix interactions. Here, an engineered framework, called an engineered extracellular matrix (EECM), was developed to provide support and cell-to-matrix interactions to developing brain organoids.We generated brain organoids using EECMs comprised of human fibrillar fibronectin supported by a highly porous polymer scaffold. The resultant brain organoids were characterized by immunofluorescence microscopy, transcriptomics, and proteomics of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compartment.The interstitial matrix-mimicking EECM enhanced neurogenesis, glial maturation, and neuronal diversity from human embryonic stem cells versus conventional protein matrix (Matrigel). Additionally, EECMs supported long-term culture, which promoted large-volume organoids containing over 250 μL of CSF. Proteomics analysis of the CSF found it superseded previous brain organoids in protein diversity, as indicated by 280 proteins spanning 500 gene ontology pathways shared with adult CSF.Engineered EECM matrices represent a major advancement in neural engineering as they have the potential to significantly enhance the structural, cellular, and functional diversity that can be achieved in advanced brain models.© 2023 The Authors.

Differential miRNA expression, which is widely shown to be associated with the pathogenesis of various diseases, can be influenced by lifestyle factors, including smoking. This study aimed to investigate the plasma miRNA signature of smoking habits, the potential effect of smoking cessation on miRNA levels, and relate the findings with lung cancer incidence.A targeted RNA-sequencing approach measured plasma miRNA levels in 2686 participants from the population-based Rotterdam study cohort. The association between cigarette smoking (current versus never) and 591 well-expressed miRNAs was assessed via adjusted linear regression models, identifying 41 smoking-associated miRNAs that passed the Bonferroni-corrected threshold (P < 0.05/591 = 8.46 × 10-5). Moreover, we found 42 miRNAs with a significant association (P < 8.46 × 10-5) between current (reference group) and former smokers. Then, we used adjusted linear regression models to explore the effect of smoking cessation time on miRNA expression levels. The expression levels of two miRNAs were significantly different within 5 years of cessation (P < 0.05/41 = 1.22 × 10-3) from current smokers, while for cessation time between 5 and 15 years we found 19 miRNAs to be significantly different from current smokers, and finally, 38 miRNAs were significantly different after more than 15 years of cessation time (P < 1.22 × 10-3). These results imply the reversibility of the smoking effect on plasma levels of at least 38 out of the 41 smoking-miRNAs following smoking cessation. Next, we found 8 out of the 41 smoking-related miRNAs to be nominally associated (P < 0.05) with the incidence of lung cancer.This study demonstrates smoking-related dysregulation of plasma miRNAs, which might have a potential for reversibility when comparing different smoking cessation groups. The identified miRNAs are involved in several cancer-related pathways and include 8 miRNAs associated with lung cancer incidence. Our results may lay the groundwork for further investigation of miRNAs as potential mechanism linking smoking, gene expression and cancer.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37318677","Integrated clinical genomic analysis reveals xenobiotic metabolic genes are downregulated in meningiomas of current smokers.","J Neurooncol","Meningiomas are the most common primary intracranial tumor. Recently, various genetic classification systems for meningioma have been described. We sought to identify clinical drivers of different molecular changes in meningioma. As such, clinical and genomic consequences of smoking in patients with meningiomas remain unexplored.88 tumor samples were analyzed in this study. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was used to assess somatic mutation burden. RNA sequencing data was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEG) and genes sets (GSEA).Fifty-seven patients had no history of smoking, twenty-two were past smokers, and nine were current smokers. The clinical data showed no major differences in natural history across smoking status. WES revealed absence of AKT1 mutation rate in current or past smokers compared to non-smokers (p = 0.046). Current smokers had increased mutation rate in NOTCH2 compared to past and never smokers (p < 0.05). Mutational signature from current and past smokers showed disrupted DNA mismatch repair (cosine-similarity = 0.759 and 0.783). DEG analysis revealed the xenobiotic metabolic genes UGT2A1 and UGT2A2 were both significantly downregulated in current smokers compared to past (Log2FC = - 3.97, padj = 0.0347 and Log2FC = - 4.18, padj = 0.0304) and never smokers (Log2FC = - 3.86, padj = 0.0235 and Log2FC = - 4.20, padj = 0.0149). GSEA analysis of current smokers showed downregulation of xenobiotic metabolism and enrichment for G2M checkpoint, E2F targets, and mitotic spindle compared to past and never smokers (FDR < 25% each).In this study, we conducted a comparative analysis of meningioma patients based on their smoking history, examining both their clinical trajectories and molecular changes. Meningiomas from current smokers were more likely to harbor NOTCH2 mutations, and AKT1 mutations were absent in current or past smokers. Moreover, both current and past smokers exhibited a mutational signature associated with DNA mismatch repair. Meningiomas from current smokers demonstrate downregulation of xenobiotic metabolic enzymes UGT2A1 and UGT2A2, which are downregulated in other smoking related cancers. Furthermore, current smokers exhibited downregulation xenobiotic metabolic gene sets, as well as enrichment in gene sets related to mitotic spindle, E2F targets, and G2M checkpoint, which are hallmark pathways involved in cell division and DNA replication control. In aggregate, our results demonstrate novel alterations in meningioma molecular biology in response to systemic carcinogens.© 2023.

"37522089","Mitochondrial epigenetics in aging and cardiovascular diseases.","Front Cardiovasc Med","Mitochondria are cellular organelles which generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules for the maintenance of cellular energy through the oxidative phosphorylation. They also regulate a variety of cellular processes including apoptosis and metabolism. Of interest, the inner part of mitochondria-the mitochondrial matrix-contains a circular molecule of DNA (mtDNA) characterised by its own transcriptional machinery. As with genomic DNA, mtDNA may also undergo nucleotide mutations that have been shown to be responsible for mitochondrial dysfunction. During physiological aging, the mitochondrial membrane potential declines and associates with enhanced mitophagy to avoid the accumulation of damaged organelles. Moreover, if the dysfunctional mitochondria are not properly cleared, this could lead to cellular dysfunction and subsequent development of several comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), diabetes, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases as well as inflammatory disorders and psychiatric diseases. As reported for genomic DNA, mtDNA is also amenable to chemical modifications, namely DNA methylation. Changes in mtDNA methylation have shown to be associated with altered transcriptional programs and mitochondrial dysfunction during aging. In addition, other epigenetic signals have been observed in mitochondria, in particular the interaction between mtDNA methylation and non-coding RNAs. Mitoepigenetic modifications are also involved in the pathogenesis of CVDs where oxygen chain disruption, mitochondrial fission, and ROS formation alter cardiac energy metabolism leading to hypertrophy, hypertension, heart failure and ischemia/reperfusion injury. In the present review, we summarize current evidence on the growing importance of epigenetic changes as modulator of mitochondrial function in aging. A better understanding of the mitochondrial epigenetic landscape may pave the way for personalized therapies to prevent age-related diseases.© 2023 Mongelli, Mengozzi, Geiger, Gorica, Mohammed, Paneni, Ruschitzka and Costantino."
"37456851","Tet2 regulates Sin3a recruitment at active enhancers in embryonic stem cells.","iScience","Tet2 is a member of the Ten-eleven translocation (Tet1/2/3) family of enzymes and is expressed in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). It demethylates DNA (catalytic functions) and partners with chromatin modifiers (noncatalytic functions) to regulate genes. However, the significance of these functions in ESCs is less defined. Using Tet2 catalytic mutant (Tet2m/m) and knockout (Tet2-/-) ESCs, we identified Tet2 target genes regulated by its catalytic dependent versus independent roles. Tet2 was enriched at their active enhancers and promoters to demethylate them. We also identified the histone deacetylase component Sin3a as a Tet2 partner, co-localizing at promoters and active enhancers. Tet2 deficiency diminished Sin3a at these regions. Tet2 and Sin3a co-occupancy overlapped with Tet1. Combined loss of Tet1/2, but not of their catalytic activities, reduced Sin3a at active enhancers. These findings establish Tet2 catalytic and noncatalytic functions as regulators of DNA demethylation and Sin3a recruitment at active enhancers in ESCs.© 2023 The Author(s)."

Their malfunction is linked to numerous diseases, and the ability to modulate their activity with synthetic ligands has yielded 16% of all FDA-approved drugs. NRs regulate distinct gene networks, however they often function from genomic sites that lack known binding motifs. Here, to annotate genomic binding sites of known and unexamined NRs more accurately, we use high-throughput SELEX to comprehensively map DNA binding site preferences of all full-length human NRs, in complex with their ligands. Furthermore, to identify non-obvious binding sites buried in DNA-protein interactomes, we develop MinSeq Find, a search algorithm based on the MinTerm concept from electrical engineering and digital systems design. The resulting MinTerm sequence set (MinSeqs) reveal a constellation of binding sites that more effectively annotate NR-binding profiles in cells. MinSeqs also unmask binding sites created or disrupted by 52,106 single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with human diseases. By implicating druggable NRs as hidden drivers of multiple human diseases, our results not only reveal new biological roles of NRs, but they also provide a resource for drug-repurposing and precision medicine.© 2023.

"37414790","TET2 and TET3 loss disrupts small intestine differentiation and homeostasis.","Nat Commun","TET2/3 play a well-known role in epigenetic regulation and mouse development. However, their function in cellular differentiation and tissue homeostasis remains poorly understood. Here we show that ablation of TET2/3 in intestinal epithelial cells results in a murine phenotype characterized by a severe homeostasis imbalance in the small intestine. Tet2/3-deleted mice show a pronounced loss of mature Paneth cells as well as fewer Tuft and more Enteroendocrine cells. Further results show major changes in DNA methylation at putative enhancers, which are associated with cell fate-determining transcription factors and functional effector genes. Notably, pharmacological inhibition of DNA methylation partially rescues the methylation and cellular defects. TET2/3 loss also alters the microbiome, predisposing the intestine to inflammation under homeostatic conditions and acute inflammation-induced death. Together, our results uncover previously unrecognized critical roles for DNA demethylation, possibly occurring subsequently to chromatin opening during intestinal development, culminating in the establishment of normal intestinal crypts.© 2023.

We analyzed array-based DNAm profiles of 160 human retinas with co-measured RNA-seq and > 8 million genetic variants, uncovering sites of genetic regulation incis(37,453 mQTLs and 12,505 eQTLs) and 13,747 eQTMs (DNAm loci affecting gene expression), with over one-third specific to the retina. mQTLs and eQTMs show non-random distribution and enrichment of biological processes related to synapse, mitochondria, and catabolism. Summary data-based Mendelian randomization and colocalization analyses identify 87 target genes where methylation and gene-expression changes likely mediate the genotype effect on age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Integrated pathway analysis reveals epigenetic regulation of immune response and metabolism including the glutathione pathway and glycolysis. Our study thus defines key roles of genetic variations driving methylation changes, prioritizes epigenetic control of gene expression, and suggests frameworks for regulation of AMD pathology by genotype-environment interaction in retina."
"37293015","DNA methylation-environment interactions in the human genome.","bioRxiv","Previously we showed that a massively parallel reporter assay, mSTARR-seq, could be used to simultaneously test for both enhancer-like activity and DNA methylation-dependent enhancer activity for millions of loci in a single experiment (Leaet al., 2018). Here we apply mSTARR-seq to query nearly the entire human genome, including almost all CpG sites profiled either on the commonly used Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC array or via reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. We show that fragments containing these sites are enriched for regulatory capacity, and that methylation-dependent regulatory activity is in turn sensitive to the cellular environment. In particular, regulatory responses to interferon alpha (IFNA) stimulation are strongly attenuated by methyl marks, indicating widespread DNA methylation-environment interactions. In agreement, methylation-dependent responses to IFNA identified via mSTARR-seq predict methylation-dependent transcriptional responses to challenge with influenza virus in human macrophages. Our observations support the idea that pre-existing DNA methylation patterns can influence the response to subsequent environmental exposures-one of the tenets of biological embedding. However, we also find that, on average, sites previously associated with early life adversity are not more likely to functionally influence gene regulation than expected by chance."

Patients with SLE disease activity 2000 (SLEDAI-2 K) > 9 and ≤ 9 were defined as severely active and mildly active, respectively. Clinical parameters and renal pathological data were collected from medical records. The correlations between NLR and clinicopathological features were analyzed.The NLR of SLE group was significantly higher than that of the sex-age matched control groups. Patients with nephritis had higher NLR levels than those without nephritis (P = 0.044). Increased NLR was observed in severely active group compared to mildly active group (P = 0.020). NLR was significantly positively related with SLEDAI score, Renal SLEDAI score, C-reactive protein (CRP), 24-h urine protein, renal activity index (AI), cellular crescents and tubular atrophy, and negatively correlated with serum albumin. NLR was significantly decreased after treatment. Based on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the best NLR cut-off value to predict severe activity of SLE and cellular crescents in renal pathology was 2.19 and 3.16, respectively.NLR may be a non-invasive and potential inflammatory marker in evaluating clinical and renal pathological activity in LN patients.© 2023.

Patients with active tuberculosis (TB), previously treated TB, active immunosuppressant therapy or human immunodeficiency virus infection were excluded. LTBI status was determined by QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-tube (QFT-GIT).After the exclusion of indeterminate results of QFT-GIT, 517 participants were enrolled and 97 (18.8%) were identified as having LTBI. Participants with LTBI were older (55.1 ± 11.4 vs. 48.5 ± 14.6 years, p < 0.001) and had a significantly higher proportion receiving HD than those without LTBI (70.1% vs. 56.7%, p = 0.001). The percentage with BCG scars was higher in the non-LTBI group than in the LTBI group (94.8% vs. 81.4%, p < 0.001), whereas the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (≥ 2.68) was significantly higher in the LTBI group (62.8% vs. 45.5%, p = 0.02).

"37404756","Metabolo-epigenetic interplay provides targeted nutritional interventions in chronic diseases and ageing.","Front Oncol","Epigenetic modifications are chemical modifications that affect gene expression without altering DNA sequences. In particular, epigenetic chemical modifications can occur on histone proteins -mainly acetylation, methylation-, and on DNA and RNA molecules -mainly methylation-. Additional mechanisms, such as RNA-mediated regulation of gene expression and determinants of the genomic architecture can also affect gene expression. Importantly, depending on the cellular context and environment, epigenetic processes can drive developmental programs as well as functional plasticity. However, misbalanced epigenetic regulation can result in disease, particularly in the context of metabolic diseases, cancer, and ageing. Non-communicable chronic diseases (NCCD) and ageing share common features including altered metabolism, systemic meta-inflammation, dysfunctional immune system responses, and oxidative stress, among others. In this scenario, unbalanced diets, such as high sugar and high saturated fatty acids consumption, together with sedentary habits, are risk factors implicated in the development of NCCD and premature ageing. The nutritional and metabolic status of individuals interact with epigenetics at different levels. Thus, it is crucial to understand how we can modulate epigenetic marks through both lifestyle habits and targeted clinical interventions -including fasting mimicking diets, nutraceuticals, and bioactive compounds- which will contribute to restore the metabolic homeostasis in NCCD. Here, we first describe key metabolites from cellular metabolic pathways used as substrates to ""write"" the epigenetic marks; and cofactors that modulate the activity of the epigenetic enzymes; then, we briefly show how metabolic and epigenetic imbalances may result in disease; and, finally, we show several examples of nutritional interventions - diet based interventions, bioactive compounds, and nutraceuticals- and exercise to counteract epigenetic alterations.Copyright © 2023 Gómez de Cedrón, Moreno Palomares and Ramírez de Molina."

Here, we performed targeted profiling of 154 epitranscriptomic reader, writer, and eraser (RWE) proteins using a scheduled liquid chromatography-parallel-reaction monitoring (LC-PRM) method coupled with the use of stable isotope-labeled (SIL) peptides as internal standards to investigate how H3K36me3 modulates the chromatin occupancies of epitranscriptomic RWE proteins. Our results showed consistent changes in chromatin occupancies of RWE proteins upon losses of H3K36me3 and H4K16ac and a role of H3K36me3 in recruiting METTL3 to chromatin following induction of DNA double-strand breaks. In addition, protein-protein interaction network and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses revealed the importance of METTL14 and TRMT11 in kidney cancer.

Rats fed HFD for 4 wk developed fatty liver, and those fed HFD for 8 wk further progressed to steatohepatitis. We observed an increase in the proportion of inflammatory macrophages, consistent with the pathological progression. Utilizing machine learning, we divided global gene regulation into modules, wherein transcription factors within a module could regulate genes within the same module, reaffirming known regulatory relationships between transcription factors and biological processes. We identified core genes-central to co-expression and protein-protein interaction-for the biological processes discovered. Notably, a large part of the core genes overlapped with genes previously implicated in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Single-nucleus ATAC-seq, combined with data-driven statistical analysis, offers insight into in vivo global gene regulation as a combination of modules and assists in identifying core genes of relevant biological processes.© 2023 Takeuchi et al."
"37443060","Stability selection enhances feature selection and enables accurate prediction of gestational age using only five DNA methylation sites.","Clin Epigenetics","DNA methylation (DNAm) is robustly associated with chronological age in children and adults, and gestational age (GA) in newborns. This property has enabled the development of several epigenetic clocks that can accurately predict chronological age and GA. However, the lack of overlap in predictive CpGs across different epigenetic clocks remains elusive. Our main aim was therefore to identify and characterize CpGs that are stably predictive of GA.We applied a statistical approach called 'stability selection' to DNAm data from 2138 newborns in the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort study. Stability selection combines subsampling with variable selection to restrict the number of false discoveries in the set of selected variables. Twenty-four CpGs were identified as being stably predictive of GA. Intriguingly, only up to 10% of the CpGs in previous GA clocks were found to be stably selected. Based on these results, we used generalized additive model regression to develop a new GA clock consisting of only five CpGs, which showed a similar predictive performance as previous GA clocks (R2 = 0.674, median absolute deviation = 4.4 days). These CpGs were in or near genes and regulatory regions involved in immune responses, metabolism, and developmental processes. Furthermore, accounting for nonlinear associations improved prediction performance in preterm newborns.We present a methodological framework for feature selection that is broadly applicable to any trait that can be predicted from DNAm data.

"37520545",NA,NA,"Epigenetic dynamics has been indicated to play a role in allergy development. The environmental stimuli have been shown to influence the methylation processes. This study investigated the differences in CpGs methylation rate of immune-attached genes between healthy and allergic infants. The research was aimed at finding evidence for the impact of environmental factors on methylation-based regulation of immunological processes in early childhood.The analysis of methylation level of CpGs in theIL4,IL5,IL10,IFNGandFOXP3genes was performed using high resolution melt real time PCR technology. DNA was isolated from whole blood of Polish healthy and allergic infants, with food allergy and/or atopic dermatitis, aged under six months.The significantly lower methylation level ofFOXP3among allergic infants compared to healthy ones was reported. Additional differences in methylation rates were found, when combining with environmental factors. In different studied groups, negative correlations between age and theIL10andFOXP3methylation were detected, and positive - in the case ofIL4. Among infants with different allergy symptoms, the decrease in methylation level ofIFNG,IL10,IL4andFOXP3associated with passive smoke exposure was observed. Complications during pregnancy were linked to different pattern of theIFNG,IL5,IL4andIL10methylation depending on allergy status. TheIFNGandIL5methylation rates were higher among exclusively breastfed infants with atopic dermatitis compared to the non-breastfed. A decrease in theIFNGmethylation was noted among allergic patients fed exclusively with milk formula. In different study groups, a negative correlation betweenIFNG,IL5methylation and maternal BMI orIL5methylation and weight was noted. Some positive correlations between methylation rate ofIL10and child's weight were found. A higher methylation ofIL4was positively correlated with the number of family members with allergy.TheFOXP3methylation in allergic infants was lower than in the healthy ones. The methylation profile ofIL4,IL5,IL10,IFNGandFOXP3associated with environmental exposures differed between the studied groups. The results offer insights into epigenetic regulation of immunological response in early childhood.Copyright © 2023 Gorzkiewicz, Łoś-Rycharska, Gawryjołek, Gołębiewski, Krogulska and Grzybowski."
"37447167","Association of the DNA Methylation of Obesity-Related Genes with the Dietary Nutrient Intake in Children.","Nutrients","The occurrence of obesity stems from both genetic and external influences. Despite thorough research and attempts to address it through various means such as dietary changes, physical activity, education, and medications, a lasting solution to this widespread problem remains elusive. Nutrients play a crucial role in various cellular processes, including the regulation of gene expression. One of the mechanisms by which nutrients can affect gene expression is through DNA methylation. This modification can alter the accessibility of DNA to transcription factors and other regulatory proteins, thereby influencing gene expression. Nutrients such as folate and vitamin B12 are involved in the one-carbon metabolism pathway, which provides the methyl groups necessary for DNA methylation. Studies have shown that the inadequate intake of these nutrients can lead to alterations in DNA methylation patterns. For this study, we aim to understand the differences in the association of the dietary intake between normal weight and overweight/obese children and between European American and African American children with the DNA methylation of the three genesNRF1,FTO, andLEPR. The research discovered a significant association between the nutritional intake of 6-10-years-old children, particularly the methyl donors present in their diet, and the methylation of theNRF1,FTO, andLEPRgenes. Additionally, the study emphasizes the significance of considering health inequalities, particularly family income and maternal education, when investigating the epigenetic impact of methyl donors in diet and gene methylation."
"37454237","Regional genetic correlations highlight relationships between neurodegenerative disease loci and the immune system.","Commun Biol","Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, are devastating complex diseases resulting in physical and psychological burdens on patients and their families. There have been important efforts to understand their genetic basis leading to the identification of disease risk-associated loci involved in several molecular mechanisms, including immune-related pathways. Regional, in contrast to genome-wide, genetic correlations between pairs of immune and neurodegenerative traits have not been comprehensively explored, but could uncover additional immune-mediated risk-associated loci. Here, we systematically assess the role of the immune system in five neurodegenerative diseases by estimating regional genetic correlations between these diseases and immune-cell-derived single-cell expression quantitative trait loci (sc-eQTLs). We also investigate correlations between diseases and protein levels. We observe significant (FDR < 0.01) correlations between sc-eQTLs and neurodegenerative diseases across 151 unique genes, spanning both the innate and adaptive immune systems, across most diseases tested. With Parkinson's, for instance, RAB7L1 in CD4+ naïve T cells is positively correlated and KANSL1-AS1 is negatively correlated across all adaptive immune cell types. Follow-up colocalization highlight candidate causal risk genes. The outcomes of this study will improve our understanding of the immune component of neurodegeneration, which can warrant repurposing of existing immunotherapies to slow disease progression.© 2023.

Many prenatal factors are well-known and increase the risk of developing diseases' after birth. Few studies indicated the link between the prenatal period and the prevalence of migraine in childhood and adolescence so far. We decided to broaden current knowledge and investigate whether the prenatal factors influence the prevalence of migraine in adulthood. The objective of this study is to provide evidence of relationship betweenin uteroenvironment and risk of migraine.In total 266 females (136 in the migraine group, 130 in the control group) and 80 males (35 in the migraine group, 45 in the control group), aged 18-65 participated in the study. The quality of prenatal environment was characterized on the basis of mother's and father's education, tobacco smoke exposure, alcohol consumption, and traumatic event during pregnancy, which are considered as prenatal factors and affect on fetal development.Migraine occurrence in adulthood was significantly associated with maternal tobacco smoking during pregnancy (OR 3.42, 95% CI 1.54-7.61,p = 0.036) and traumatic event during pregnancy (OR 2.27, 95% CI 1.24-4.13,p = 0.020).Our study suggests that the fetal programming effect of tobacco smoking exposure and maternal trauma is not limited to prenatal life and is suggested as having a role in adulthood.

To evaluate the prevalence of EBV in GC patients from the Chilean population, we studied 54 GC samples using the gold standard detection method of EBV-encoded small RNA (EBER). The EBV-positive samples were subjected to amplification and sequencing of the Epstein-Barr virus nuclear protein 3A (EBNA3A) gene to evaluate the genetic diversity of EBV strains circulating in southern Chile. In total, 22.2% of the GC samples were EBV-positive and significantly associated with diffuse-type histology (p= 0.003). Phylogenetic analyses identified EBV-1 and EBV-2 in the GC samples, showing genetic diversity among Chilean isolates.

Sex differences in cancer are evident in death rates and treatment responses in several cancers. Asian patients have unique cancer epidemiology influenced by their genetic ancestry and sociocultural factors in the region. In this review, we show molecular associations that potentially mediate sex disparities observed in cancer in Asian populations. Differences in sex characteristics are evident at the cytogenetic, genetic, and epigenetic levels mediating processes that include cell cycle, oncogenesis, and metastasis. Larger clinical andin vitrostudies that explore mechanisms can confirm the associations of these molecular markers.

"37345823","Birth Weight Is Associated With Clonal Hematopoiesis of Indeterminate Potential and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Adulthood.","J Am Heart Assoc","Background High and low birth weight are independently associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk in adulthood. Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), the age-related clonal expansion of hematopoietic cells with preleukemic somatic mutations, predicts incident cardiovascular disease independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Whether birth weight predicts development of CHIP later in life is unknown. Methods and Results A total of 221 047 adults enrolled in the UK Biobank with whole exome sequences and self-reported birth weight were analyzed. Of those, 22 030 (11.5%) had low (<2.5 kg) and 29 292 (14.7%) high birth weight (>4.0 kg). CHIP prevalence was higher among participants with low (6.0%,P=0.049) and high (6.3%,P<0.001) versus normal birth weight (5.7%, ref.). Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression analyses demonstrated that each 1-kg increase in birth weight was associated with a 3% increased risk of CHIP (odds ratio, 1.03 [95% CI, 1.00-1.06];P=0.04), driven by a stronger association observed between birth weight andDNMT3ACHIP (odds ratio, 1.04 per 1-kg increase [95% CI, 1.01-1.08];P=0.02). Mendelian randomization analyses supported a causal relationship of longer gestational age at delivery withDNMT3ACHIP. Multivariable Cox regression demonstrated that CHIP was independently and additively associated with incident cardiovascular disease or death across birth weight groups, with highest absolute risks in those with CHIP plus high or low birth weight. Conclusions Higher birth weight is associated with increased risk of developing CHIP in midlife, especiallyDNMT3ACHIP. These findings identify a novel risk factor for CHIP and provide insights into the relationships among early-life environment, CHIP, cancer, and cardiovascular disease."
"37425013","Moving CNS axon growth and regeneration research into human model systems.","Front Neurosci","Axon regeneration is limited in the adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS) due to both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Rodent studies have shown that developmental age can drive differences in intrinsic axon growth ability, such that embryonic rodent CNS neurons extend long axons while postnatal and adult CNS neurons do not. In recent decades, scientists have identified several intrinsic developmental regulators in rodents that modulate growth. However, whether this developmentally programmed decline in CNS axon growth is conserved in humans is not yet known. Until recently, there have been limited human neuronal model systems, and even fewer age-specific human models. Humanin vitromodels range from pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons to directly reprogrammed (transdifferentiated) neurons derived from human somatic cells. In this review, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each system, and how studying axon growth in human neurons can provide species-specific knowledge in the field of CNS axon regeneration with the goal of bridging basic science studies to clinical trials. Additionally, with the increased availability and quality of 'omics datasets of human cortical tissue across development and lifespan, scientists can mine these datasets for developmentally regulated pathways and genes. As there has been little research performed in human neurons to study modulators of axon growth, here we provide a summary of approaches to begin to shift the field of CNS axon growth and regeneration into human model systems to uncover novel drivers of axon growth.Copyright © 2023 Lear and Moore."
"37485054","Low birthweight is associated with epigenetic age acceleration in the first 3 years of life.","Evol Med Public Health","The Developmental Origins of Health and Disease hypothesis posits that early life adversity is associated with poor adult health outcomes. Epidemiological evidence has supported this framework by linking low birthweight with adult health and mortality, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Accelerated epigenetic aging may be a pathway to connect early life experiences with adult health outcomes, based on associations of accelerated epigenetic aging with increased morbidity and mortality.Sixty-seven mother-infant dyads were recruited in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Birthweight data were collected at birth, and blood samples were collected at birth and follow-up visits up to age 3. DNA methylation data were generated with the Illumina MethylationEPIC array and used to estimate epigenetic age. A multilevel model was used to test for associations between birthweight and epigenetic age acceleration.Chronological age was highly correlated with epigenetic age from birth to age 3 (r= 0.95,p< 2.2 × 10-16). Variation in epigenetic age acceleration increased over time. Birthweight, dichotomized around 2500 g, predicted epigenetic age acceleration over the first 3 years of life (b= -0.39,p= 0.005).Our longitudinal analysis provides the first evidence for accelerated epigenetic aging that emerges between birth and age 3 and associates with low birthweight. These results suggest that early life experiences, such as low birthweight, may shape the trajectory of epigenetic aging in early childhood. Furthermore, accelerated epigenetic aging may be a pathway that links low birthweight and poor adult health outcomes.© The Author(s) 2023.

"37495687","Evolutionary histories of breast cancer and related clones.","Nature","Recent studies have documented frequent evolution of clones carrying common cancer mutations in apparently normal tissues, which are implicated in cancer development1-3. However, our knowledge is still missing with regard to what additional driver events take place in what order, before one or more of these clones in normal tissues ultimately evolve to cancer. Here, using phylogenetic analyses of multiple microdissected samples from both cancer and non-cancer lesions, we show unique evolutionary histories of breast cancers harbouring der(1;16), a common driver alteration found in roughly 20% of breast cancers. The approximate timing of early evolutionary events was estimated from the mutation rate measured in normal epithelial cells. In der(1;16)(+) cancers, the derivative chromosome was acquired from early puberty to late adolescence, followed by the emergence of a common ancestor by the patient's early 30s, from which both cancer and non-cancer clones evolved. Replacing the pre-existing mammary epithelium in the following years, these clones occupied a large area within the premenopausal breast tissues by the time of cancer diagnosis. Evolution of multiple independent cancer founders from the non-cancer ancestors was common, contributing to intratumour heterogeneity. The number of driver events did not correlate with histology, suggesting the role of local microenvironments and/or epigenetic driver events. A similar evolutionary pattern was also observed in another case evolving from an AKT1-mutated founder. Taken together, our findings provide new insight into how breast cancer evolves.© 2023.

However, the macro-alterations that characterise liver metastasis in breast cancer(BC) are poorly understood. Here, we conducted a whole-genome sequencing analysis of liver metastases to explore the status and the time frame model of these macro-alterations in pre-treatment patients with metastatic breast cancer.Whole-genome sequencing was conducted in 11 paired primary tumours, lymph node metastasis, and liver metastasis fresh samples from four patients with late-stage breast cancer. We also chose five postoperative frozen specimens from patients with early-stage breast cancer before any treatment as control. Surprisingly, all four liver metastasis samples were classified as WGD + . However, the previous study reported that WGD happened in 30% of cancers and 2/5 in our early-stage samples. WGD was not observed in the two separate primary tumours and one lymph node metastasis of one patient with metastatic BC, but her liver metastasis showed an early burst of bi-allelic copy number gain. The phylogenetic tree proves her 4 tumour samples were the polyclonal origin and only one WGD + clone metastasis to the liver. Another 3 metastatic BC patients' primary tumour and lymph node metastasis experienced WGD as well as liver metastasis, and they all showed similar molecular time-frame of copy number(CN) gain across locations within the same patient. These patients' tumours were of monoclonal origin, and WGD happened in a founding clone before metastasis, explaining that all samples share the CN-gain time frame. After WGD, the genomes usually face instability to evolve other macro-alterations. For example, a greater quantity and variety of complex structural variations (SVs) were detected in WGD + samples. The breakpoints were enriched in the chr17: 39 Mb-40 Mb tile, which contained the HER2 gene, resulting in the formation of tyfonas, breakage-fusion-bridge cycles, and double minutes. These complex SVs may be involved in the evolutionary mechanisms of the dramatic increase of HER2 copy number.Our work revealed that the WGD + clone might be a critical evolution step for liver metastasis and favoured following complex SV of breast cancer.© 2023.

However, the genomic and evolutionary characteristics of metastatic GC have not been widely evaluated.Whole-exome sequencing data were analyzed for 99 primary and paired metastatic gastric cancers from 15 patients who underwent gastrectomy and metastasectomy.Hematogenous metastatic tumors were associated with increased chromosomal instability and de novo gain/amplification in cancer driver genes, whereas peritoneal/ovarian metastasis was linked to sustained chromosomal stability and de novo somatic mutations in driver genes. The genomic distance of the hematogenous and peritoneal metastatic tumors was found to be closer to the primary tumors than lymph node (LN) metastasis, while ovarian metastasis was closer to LN and peritoneal metastasis than the primary tumor. Two migration patterns for metastatic GCs were identified; branched and diaspora. Both molecular subtypes of the metastatic tumors, rather than the primary tumor, and their migration patterns were related to patient survival.Genomic characteristics of metastatic gastric cancer is distinctive by routes and associated with patients' prognosis along with genomic evolution pattenrs, indicating that both primary and metastatic gastric cancers require genomic evaluation.© 2023.

"37398383","""Evolution of the mutation spectrum across a mammalian phylogeny"".","bioRxiv","Little is known about how the spectrum and etiology of germline mutagenesis might vary among mammalian species. To shed light on this mystery, we quantify variation in mutational sequence context biases using polymorphism data from thirteen species of mice, apes, bears, wolves, and cetaceans. After normalizing the mutation spectrum for reference genome accessibility andk-mer content, we use the Mantel test to deduce that mutation spectrum divergence is highly correlated with genetic divergence between species, whereas life history traits like reproductive age are weaker predictors of mutation spectrum divergence. Potential bioinformatic confounders are only weakly related to a small set of mutation spectrum features. We find that clocklike mutational signatures previously inferred from human cancers cannot explain the phylogenetic signal exhibited by the mammalian mutation spectrum, despite the ability of these clocklike signatures to fit each species' 3-mer spectrum with high cosine similarity. In contrast, parental aging signatures inferred from human de novo mutation data appear to explain much of the mutation spectrum's phylogenetic signal when fit to non-context-dependent mutation spectrum data in combination with a novel mutational signature. We posit that future models purporting to explain the etiology of mammalian mutagenesis need to capture the fact that more closely related species have more similar mutation spectra; a model that fits each marginal spectrum with high cosine similarity is not guaranteed to capture this hierarchy of mutation spectrum variation among species."
"37466633","Integrating analog and digital modes of gene expression at Arabidopsis FLC.","Elife","Quantitative gene regulation at the cell population level can be achieved by two fundamentally different modes of regulation at individual gene copies. A 'digital' mode involves binary ON/OFF expression states, with population-level variation arising from the proportion of gene copies in each state, while an 'analog' mode involves graded expression levels at each gene copy. At theArabidopsisfloral repressorFLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC),'digital' Polycomb silencing is known to facilitate quantitative epigenetic memory in response to cold. However, whetherFLCregulation before cold involves analog or digital modes is unknown. Using quantitative fluorescent imaging ofFLCmRNA and protein, together with mathematical modeling, we find thatFLCexpression before cold is regulated by both analog and digital modes. We observe a temporal separation between the two modes, with analog preceding digital. The analog mode can maintain intermediate expression levels at individualFLCgene copies, before subsequent digital silencing, consistent with the copies switching OFF stochastically and heritably without cold. This switch leads to a slow reduction inFLCexpression at the cell population level. These data present a new paradigm for gradual repression, elucidating how analog transcriptional and digital epigenetic memory pathways can be integrated.© 2023, Antoniou-Kourounioti, Meschichi, Reeck et al."
"37398290","Tuning methylation-dependent silencing dynamics by synthetic modulation of CpG density.","bioRxiv","Methylation of cytosines in CG dinucleotides (CpGs) within promoters has been shown to lead to gene silencing in mammals in natural contexts. Recently, engineered recruitment of methyltransferases (DNMTs) at specific loci was shown to be sufficient to silence synthetic and endogenous gene expression through this mechanism. A critical parameter for DNA methylation-based silencing is the distribution of CpGs within the target promoter. However, how the number or density of CpGs in the target promoter affects the dynamics of silencing by DNMT recruitment has remained unclear. Here we constructed a library of promoters with systematically varying CpG content, and analyzed the rate of silencing in response to recruitment of DNMT. We observed a tight correlation between silencing rate and CpG content. Further, methylation-specific analysis revealed a constant accumulation rate of methylation at the promoter after DNMT recruitment. We identified a single CpG site between TATA box and transcription start site (TSS) that accounted for a substantial part of the difference in silencing rates between promoters with differing CpG content, indicating that certain residues play disproportionate roles in controlling silencing. Together, these results provide a library of promoters for synthetic epigenetic and gene regulation applications, as well as insights into the regulatory link between CpG content and silencing rate."
"37396613","Statistical inference of the rates of cell proliferation and phenotypic switching in cancer.","ArXiv","Recent evidence suggests that nongenetic (epigenetic) mechanisms play an important role at all stages of cancer evolution. In many cancers, these mechanisms have been observed to induce dynamic switching between two or more cell states, which commonly show differential responses to drug treatments. To understand how these cancers evolve over time, and how they respond to treatment, we need to understand the state-dependent rates of cell proliferation and phenotypic switching. In this work, we propose a rigorous statistical framework for estimating these parameters, using data from commonly performed cell line experiments, where phenotypes are sorted and expanded in culture. The framework explicitly models the stochastic dynamics of cell division, cell death and phenotypic switching, and it provides likelihood-based confidence intervals for the model parameters. The input data can be either the fraction of cells or the number of cells in each state at one or more time points. Through a combination of theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we show that when cell fraction data is used, the rates of switching may be the only parameters that can be estimated accurately. On the other hand, using cell number data enables accurate estimation of the net division rate for each phenotype, and it can even enable estimation of the state-dependent rates of cell division and cell death. We conclude by applying our framework to a publicly available dataset."

To uncover biomarkers of BPD risk, this study investigated epigenetic and transcriptomic signatures of prematurity at birth and during the neonatal period at day 14 and 28. Peripheral blood DNAs from preterm infants were applied to methylation arrays and cell-type composition was estimated by deconvolution. Covariate-adjusted robust linear regression elucidated BPD- and prolonged oxygen (≥ 14 days) exposure-associated CpGs. RNAs from cord and peripheral blood were sequenced, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for BPD or oxygen exposure were determined. Estimated neutrophil-lymphocyte ratios in peripheral blood at day 14 in BPD infants were significantly higher than nonBPD infants, suggesting an heightened inflammatory response in developing BPD. BPD-DEGs in cord blood indicated lymphopoiesis inhibition, altered Th1/Th2 responses, DNA damage, and organ degeneration. On day 14, BPD-associated CpGs were highly enriched in neutrophil activation, infection, and CD4 + T cell quantity, and BPD-DEGs were involved in DNA damage, cellular senescence, T cell homeostasis, and hyper-cytokinesis. On day 28, BPD-associated CpGs along with BPD-DEGs were enriched for phagocytosis, neurological disorder, and nucleotide metabolism. Oxygen supplementation markedly downregulated mitochondrial biogenesis genes and altered CpGs annotated to developmental genes. Prematurity-altered DNA methylation could cause abnormal lymphopoiesis, cellular assembly and cell cycle progression to increase BPD risk. Similar pathways between epigenome and transcriptome networks suggest coordination of the two in dysregulating leukopoiesis, adaptive immunity, and innate immunity. The results provide molecular insights into biomarkers for early detection and prevention of BPD.© 2023.

In the present study, we introduce a new method, polygenic priority score (PoPS), that learns trait-relevant gene features, such as cell-type-specific expression, to prioritize genes at GWAS loci. Using a large evaluation set of genes with fine-mapped coding variants, we show that PoPS and the closest gene individually outperform other gene prioritization methods, but observe the best overall performance by combining PoPS with orthogonal methods. Using this combined approach, we prioritize 10,642 unique gene-trait pairs across 113 complex traits and diseases with high precision, finding not only well-established gene-trait relationships but nominating new genes at unresolved loci, such as LGR4 for estimated glomerular filtration rate and CCR7 for deep vein thrombosis.

Of these, only eleven proteins have been previously associated with PD risk (e.g., GRN or GPNMB). Proteome-wide association study (PWAS) analyses suggested that the levels of ten of those proteins were genetically correlated with PD risk, and seven were validated in the PPMI cohort. Mendelian randomization analyses identified GPNMB, LCT, and CD68 causal for PD and nominate one more (ITGB2). These 25 proteins were enriched for microglia-specific proteins and trafficking pathways (both lysosome and intracellular). This study not only demonstrates that protein phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) and trans-protein quantitative trail loci (pQTL) analyses are powerful for identifying novel protein interactions in an unbiased manner, but also that LRRK2 is linked with the regulation of PD-associated proteins that are enriched in microglial cells and specific lysosomal pathways.© 2023.

Despite previous studies have found that they shared symptoms and heterogeneity, it remained difficult to systematically identify the risk genes associated with them.By using the CAGE (Cap Analysis of Gene Expression) read alignment files for 439 human cell and tissue types (including primary cells, tissues and cell lines) from FANTOM5 project, we predicted enhancer-promoter interactions (EPIs) of 439 cell and tissue types in human, and examined their reliability. Then we evaluated the genetic heritability of 17 diverse brain disorders and behavioral-cognitive phenotypes in each neural cell type, brain region, and developmental stage. Furthermore, we prioritized genes associated with brain disorders and phenotypes by leveraging the EPIs in each neural cell and tissue type, and analyzed their pleiotropy and functionality for different categories of disorders and phenotypes. Finally, we characterized the spatiotemporal expression dynamics of these associated genes in cells and tissues.We found that identified EPIs showed activity specificity and network aggregation in cell and tissue types, and enriched TF binding in neural cells played key roles in synaptic plasticity and nerve cell development, i.e., EGR1 and SOX family. We also discovered that most neurological disorders exhibit heritability enrichment in neural stem cells and astrocytes, while psychiatric disorders and behavioral-cognitive phenotypes exhibit enrichment in neurons. Furthermore, our identified genes recapitulated well-known risk genes, which exhibited widespread pleiotropy between psychiatric disorders and behavioral-cognitive phenotypes (i.e., FOXP2), and indicated expression specificity in neural cell types, brain regions, and developmental stages associated with disorders and phenotypes. Importantly, we showed the potential associations of brain disorders with brain regions and developmental stages that have not been well studied.Overall, our study characterized the gene-enhancer regulatory networks and genetic mechanisms in the human neural cells and tissues, and illustrated the value of reanalysis of publicly available genomic datasets.© 2023.

"37474751","Investigating the tissue specificity and prognostic impact of cis-regulatory cancer risk variants.","Hum Genet","The tissue-specific incidence of cancers and their genetic basis are poorly understood. Although prior studies have shown global correlation across tissues for cancer risk single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS), any shared functional regulation of gene expression on a per SNP basis has not been well characterized. We set to quantify cis-mediated gene regulation and tissue sharing for SNPs associated with eight common cancers. We identify significant tissue sharing for individual SNPs and global enrichment for breast, colorectal, and Hodgkin lymphoma cancer risk SNPs in multiple tissues. In addition, we observe increasing tissue sharing for cancer risk SNPs overlapping with super-enhancers for breast cancer and Hodgkin lymphoma providing further evidence of tissue specificity. Finally, for genes under cis-regulation by breast cancer SNPs, we identify a phenotype characterized by low expression of tumor suppressors and negative regulators of the WNT pathway associated with worse freedom from progression and overall survival in patients who eventually develop breast cancer. Our results introduce a paradigm for functionally annotating individual cancer risk SNPs and will inform the design of future translational studies aimed to personalize assessment of inherited cancer risk across tissues.© 2023.

"37468586","Organization of the human intestine at single-cell resolution.","Nature","The intestine is a complex organ that promotes digestion, extracts nutrients, participates in immune surveillance, maintains critical symbiotic relationships with microbiota and affects overall health1. The intesting has a length of over nine metres, along which there are differences in structure and function2. The localization of individual cell types, cell type development trajectories and detailed cell transcriptional programs probably drive these differences in function. Here, to better understand these differences, we evaluated the organization of single cells using multiplexed imaging and single-nucleus RNA and open chromatin assays across eight different intestinal sites from nine donors. Through systematic analyses, we find cell compositions that differ substantially across regions of the intestine and demonstrate the complexity of epithelial subtypes, and find that the same cell types are organized into distinct neighbourhoods and communities, highlighting distinct immunological niches that are present in the intestine. We also map gene regulatory differences in these cells that are suggestive of a regulatory differentiation cascade, and associate intestinal disease heritability with specific cell types. These results describe the complexity of the cell composition, regulation and organization for this organ, and serve as an important reference map for understanding human biology and disease.© 2023.

"37464041","Depression pathophysiology, risk prediction of recurrence and comorbid psychiatric disorders using genome-wide analyses.","Nat Med","Depression is a common psychiatric disorder and a leading cause of disability worldwide. Here we conducted a genome-wide association study meta-analysis of six datasets, including >1.3 million individuals (371,184 with depression) and identified 243 risk loci. Overall, 64 loci were new, including genes encoding glutamate and GABA receptors, which are targets for antidepressant drugs. Intersection with functional genomics data prioritized likely causal genes and revealed new enrichment of prenatal GABAergic neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocyte lineages. We found depression to be highly polygenic, with ~11,700 variants explaining 90% of the single-nucleotide polymorphism heritability, estimating that >95% of risk variants for other psychiatric disorders (anxiety, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) were influencing depression risk when both concordant and discordant variants were considered, and nearly all depression risk variants influenced educational attainment. Additionally, depression genetic risk was associated with impaired complex cognition domains. We dissected the genetic and clinical heterogeneity, revealing distinct polygenic architectures across subgroups of depression and demonstrating significantly increased absolute risks for recurrence and psychiatric comorbidity among cases of depression with the highest polygenic burden, with considerable sex differences. The risks were up to 5- and 32-fold higher than cases with the lowest polygenic burden and the background population, respectively. These results deepen the understanding of the biology underlying depression, its disease progression and inform precision medicine approaches to treatment.© 2023.

However, the relationship between rare deleterious compound heterozygous (CH) variation and their phenotypic impact has not been fully investigated. Here, we leverage advances in statistical phasing to accurately phase rare variants (MAF ∼ 0.001%) in exome sequencing data from 175,587 UK Biobank (UKBB) participants, which we then systematically annotate to identify putatively deleterious CH coding variation. We show that 6.5% of individuals carry such damaging variants in the CH state, with 90% of variants occurring at MAF < 0.34%. Using a logistic mixed model framework, systematically accounting for relatedness, polygenic risk, nearby common variants, and rare variant burden, we investigate recessive effects in common complex diseases. We find six exome-wide significant (𝑃 < 1.68 × 10-7) and 17 nominally significant (𝑃 < 5.25 × 10-5) gene-trait associations. Among these, only four would have been identified without accounting for CH variation in the gene. We further incorporate age-at-diagnosis information from primary care electronic health records, to show that genetic phase influences lifetime risk of disease across 20 gene-trait combinations (FDR < 5%). Using a permutation approach, we find evidence for genetic phase contributing to disease susceptibility for a collection of gene-trait pairs, includingFLG-asthma (𝑃 = 0.00205) andUSH2A-visual impairment (𝑃 = 0.0084). Taken together, we demonstrate the utility of phasing large-scale genetic sequencing cohorts for robust identification of the phenome-wide consequences of compound heterozygosity."
"37461309","Genetic insights into ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament of the spine.","Elife","Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament of the spine (OPLL) is an intractable disease leading to severe neurological deficits. Its etiology and pathogenesis are primarily unknown. The relationship between OPLL and comorbidities, especially type 2 diabetes (T2D) and high body mass index (BMI), has been the focus of attention; however, no trait has been proven to have a causal relationship. We conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) using 22,016 Japanese individuals and identified 14 significant loci, 8 of which were previously unreported. We then conducted a gene-based association analysis and a transcriptome-wide Mendelian randomization approach and identified three candidate genes for each. Partitioning heritability enrichment analyses observed significant enrichment of the polygenic signals in the active enhancers of the connective/bone cell group, especially H3K27ac in chondrogenic differentiation cells, as well as the immune/hematopoietic cell group. Single-cell RNA sequencing of Achilles tendon cells from a mouse Achilles tendon ossification model confirmed the expression of genes in GWAS and post-GWAS analyses in mesenchymal and immune cells. Genetic correlations with 96 complex traits showed positive correlations with T2D and BMI and a negative correlation with cerebral aneurysm. Mendelian randomization analysis demonstrated a significant causal effect of increased BMI and high bone mineral density on OPLL. We evaluated the clinical images in detail and classified OPLL into cervical, thoracic, and the other types. GWAS subanalyses identified subtype-specific signals. A polygenic risk score for BMI demonstrated that the effect of BMI was particularly strong in thoracic OPLL. Our study provides genetic insight into the etiology and pathogenesis of OPLL and is expected to serve as a basis for future treatment development.© 2023, Koike, Takahata, Nakajima et al."

In this study, we quantitatively assessed 136 ear morphology traits using deep learning analysis of digital face images in 14,921 individuals from five different cohorts in Europe, Asia, and Latin America. Through GWAS meta-analysis and C-GWASs, a recently introduced method to effectively combine GWASs of many traits, we identified 16 genetic loci involved in various ear phenotypes, eight of which have not been previously associated with human ear features. Our findings suggest that ear morphology shares genetic determinants with other surface ectoderm-derived traits such as facial variation, mono eyebrow, and male pattern baldness. Our results enhance the genetic understanding of human ear morphology and shed light on the shared genetic contributors of different surface ectoderm-derived phenotypes. Additionally, gene editing experiments in mice have demonstrated that knocking out the newly ear-associated gene (Intu) and a previously ear-associated gene (Tbx15) causes deviating mouse ear morphology.Copyright: © 2023 Li et al.

Although preadipocytes may contribute to this pro-inflammatory environment, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. We used human primary preadipocytes from body mass index (BMI) -discordant monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs to generate epigenetic (ATAC-sequence) and transcriptomic (RNA-sequence) data for testing whether increased BMI alters the subnuclear compartmentalization of open chromatin in the twins' preadipocytes, causing downstream inflammation. Here we show that the co-accessibility of open chromatin, i.e. compartmentalization of chromatin activity, is altered in the higher vs lower BMI MZ siblings for a large subset ( ~ 88.5 Mb) of the active subnuclear compartments. Using the UK Biobank we show that variants within these regions contribute to systemic inflammation through interactions with BMI on C-reactive protein. In summary, open chromatin co-accessibility in human preadipocytes is disrupted among the higher BMI siblings, suggesting a mechanism how obesity may lead to inflammation via gene-environment interactions.© 2023.

Pertaining to the SF-36 questionnaire, the lowest average scores were found in the energy/fatigue subscales and in the limitations due to mental health, which remained consistent across surgery types with a significant decrease in the SADI-S group. Concerning the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire, the lowest mean scores were found in the environment (15.03 ± 2.37) and social relations (16.08 ± 2.22) subscales, whilst the highest average scores were in physical health (16.30 ± 2.03) and mental health (16.57 ± 2.16).the findings revealed that whilst bariatric surgery significantly improved physical health, it resulted in a decrease in mental health scores. Consequently, the study emphasizes the importance of adopting a holistic approach to managing obesity that considers improving both physical and mental health outcomes."
"37398441","The Genetic Architecture of Biological Age in Nine Human Organ Systems.","medRxiv","Understanding the genetic basis of biological aging in multi-organ systems is vital for elucidating age-related disease mechanisms and identifying therapeutic interventions. This study characterized the genetic architecture of the biological age gap (BAG) across nine human organ systems in 377,028 individuals of European ancestry from the UK Biobank. We discovered 393 genomic loci, including 143 novel loci, associated with the BAG of the brain, eye, cardiovascular, hepatic, immune, metabolic, musculoskeletal, pulmonary, and renal systems. We also observed BAG-organ specificity and inter-organ crosstalk. Genetic variants associated with the nine BAGs are predominantly specific to the respective organ system while exerting pleiotropic effects on traits linked to multiple organ systems. A gene-drug-disease network confirmed the involvement of the metabolic BAG-associated genes in drugs targeting various metabolic disorders. Genetic correlation analyses supported Cheverud's Conjecture1- the genetic correlation between BAGs mirrors their phenotypic correlation. A causal network revealed potential causal effects linking chronic diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's disease), body weight, and sleep duration to the BAG of multiple organ systems. Our findings shed light on promising therapeutic interventions to enhance human organ health within a complex multi-organ network, including lifestyle modifications and potential drug repositioning strategies for treating chronic diseases.

However, its performance in other populations is unknown. A functional PRS (fPRS) using functional SNPs (fSNPs) may improve the generalizability of the PRS across populations with distinct ethnicities.We performed functional annotations on SNPs in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the 112 previously reported SNPs to identify fSNPs that affect protein-coding or transcriptional regulation. Subsequently, we constructed an fPRS based on the fSNPs by using the LDpred2-infinitesimal model and then analyzed the performance of the PRS-112 and fPRS in the risk prediction of gastric cancer in 457,521 European participants of the UK Biobank cohort. Finally, the performance of the fPRS in combination with lifestyle factors were evaluated in predicting the risk of gastric cancer.During 4,582,045 person-years of follow-up with a total of 623 incident gastric cancer cases, we found no significant association between the PRS-112 and gastric cancer risk in the European population (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.00 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93-1.09], P = 0.846). We identified 125 fSNPs, including seven deleterious protein-coding SNPs and 118 regulatory non-coding SNPs, and used them to construct the fPRS-125. Our result showed that the fPRS-125 was significantly associated with gastric cancer risk (HR = 1.11 [95% CI, 1.03-1.20], P = 0.009). Compared to participants with a low fPRS-125 (bottom quintile), those with a high fPRS-125 (top quintile) had a higher risk of incident gastric cancer (HR = 1.43 [95% CI, 1.12-1.84], P = 0.005). Moreover, we observed that participants with both an unfavorable lifestyle and a high genetic risk had the highest risk of incident gastric cancer (HR = 4.99 [95% CI, 1.55-16.10], P = 0.007) compared to those with both a favorable lifestyle and a low genetic risk.These results indicate that the fPRS-125 derived from fSNPs may act as an indicator to measure the genetic risk of gastric cancer in the European population.Copyright © 2023 The Chinese Medical Association, produced by Wolters Kluwer, Inc. under the CC-BY-NC-ND license."

Genome-wide association studies have identified genetic variants for BP, but functional insights into causality and related molecular mechanisms lag behind. We functionally characterize 4,608 genetic variants in linkage with 135 BP loci in vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiomyocytes by massively parallel reporter assays. High densities of regulatory variants at BP loci (i.e.,ULK4,MAP4,CFDP1,PDE5A) indicate that multiple variants drive genetic association. Regulatory variants are enriched in repeats, alter cardiovascular-related transcription factor motifs, and spatially converge with genes controlling specific cardiovascular pathways. Using heuristic scoring, we define likely causal variants, and CRISPR prime editing finally determines causal variants forKCNK9,SFXN2, andPCGF6, which are candidates for developing high BP. Our systems-level approach provides a catalog of functionally relevant variants and their genomic architecture in two trait-relevant cell lines for a better understanding of BP gene regulation.© 2023 The Authors."

Moreover, causal variants are hard to statistically fine-map at many loci because of widespread linkage disequilibrium. To address this challenge, we present a strategy utilizing transcription factor (TF) binding quantitative trait loci (bQTLs) for colocalization analysis to identify trait associations likely mediated by TF occupancy variation and to pinpoint likely causal variants using motif scores. We applied this approach to PU.1 bQTLs in lymphoblastoid cell lines and blood cell trait GWAS data. Colocalization analysis revealed 69 blood cell trait GWAS loci putatively driven by PU.1 occupancy variation. We nominate PU.1 motif-altering variants as the likely shared causal variants at 51 loci. Such integration of TF bQTL data with other GWAS data may reveal transcriptional regulatory mechanisms and causal noncoding variants underlying additional complex traits.© 2023 The Author(s)."

Dysregulation of this process may result in the failure to produce functional B cells and pose a risk of leukemic transformation. Here, we report that AT rich interacting domain 5B (ARID5B), a B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) risk gene, regulates B cell development at the Pre-B stage. In both mice and humans, we observed a significant upregulation ofARID5Bexpression that initiates at the Pre-B stage and is maintained throughout later stages of B cell development. In mice, deletion ofArid5b in vivoandex vivoexhibited a significant reduction in the proportion of immature B cells but an increase in large and small Pre-B cells.Arid5binhibitionex vivoalso led to an increase in proliferation of both Pre-B cell populations. Metabolic studies in mouse and human bone marrow revealed that fatty acid uptake peaked in proliferative B cells then decreased during non-proliferative stages. We showed thatArid5bablation enhanced fatty acid uptake and oxidation in Pre-B cells. Furthermore, decreasedARID5Bexpression was observed in tumor cells from B-ALL patients when compared to B cells from non-leukemic individuals. In B-ALL patients,ARID5Bexpression below the median was associated with decreased survival particularly in subtypes originating from Pre-B cells. Collectively, our data indicated thatArid5bregulates fatty acid metabolism and proliferation of Pre-B cells in mice, and reduced expression ofARID5Bin humans is a risk factor for B cell leukemia.Copyright © 2023 Chalise, Ehsani, Lemecha, Hung, Zhang, Larson and Itakura."

"37455310","A functional mechanism for a non-coding variant near AGTR2 associated with risk for preterm birth.","BMC Med","Preterm birth (PTB), defined as delivery before 37 gestational weeks, imposes significant public health burdens. A recent maternal genome-wide association study of spontaneous PTB identified a noncoding locus near the angiotensin II receptor type 2 (AGTR2) gene. Genotype-Tissue Expression data revealed that alleles associated with decreased AGTR2 expression in the uterus were linked to an increased risk of PTB and shortened gestational duration. We hypothesized that a causative variant in this locus modifies AGTR2 expression by altering transcription factor (TF) binding.To investigate this hypothesis, we performed bioinformatics analyses and functional characterizations at the implicated locus. Potential causal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were prioritized, and allele-dependent binding of TFs was predicted. Reporter assays were employed to assess the enhancer activity of the top PTB-associated non-coding variant, rs7889204, and its impact on TF binding.Our analyses revealed that rs7889204, a top PTB-associated non-coding genetic variant is one of the strongest eQTLs for the AGTR2 gene in uterine tissue samples. We observed differential binding of CEBPB (CCAAT enhancer binding protein beta) and HOXA10 (homeobox A10) to the alleles of rs7889204. Reporter assays demonstrated decreased enhancer activity for the rs7889204 risk ""C"" allele.Collectively, these results demonstrate that decreased AGTR2 expression caused by reduced transcription factor binding increases the risk for PTB and suggest that enhancing AGTR2 activity may be a preventative measure in reducing PTB risk.© 2023.

Hepatic steatosis may result from the dysfunction of multiple pathways and thus multiple molecular triggers involved in the disease have been described. The development of NASH entails the activation of inflammatory and fibrotic processes. Furthermore, NAFLD is also strongly associated with several extra-hepatic comorbidities, i.e., metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease. Due to the heterogeneity of NAFLD presentations and the multifactorial etiology of the disease, clinical trials for NAFLD treatment are testing a wide range of interventions and drugs, with little success. Here, we propose a narrative review of the different phenotypic characteristics of NAFLD patients, whose disease may be triggered by different agents and driven along different pathophysiological pathways.

Brown and beige adipocytes, which produce heat, are characterized by high expression of uncoupling protein (UCP) 1, multilocular lipid droplets, and large amounts of mitochondria. The rs1421085 T-to-C single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the humanFTOgene interrupts a conserved motif for ARID5B repressor, resulting in adipocyte type shift from beige to white.Methods:We obtained abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue from donors carryingFTOrs1421085 TT (risk-free) or CC (obesity-risk) genotypes, isolated and differentiated their preadipocytes into beige adipocytes (driven by the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone for 14 days), and activated them with dibutyryl-cAMP for 4 hours. Then, either the same culture conditions were applied for additional 14 days (active beige adipocytes) or it was replaced by a white differentiation medium (inactive beige adipocytes). White adipocytes were differentiated by their medium for 28 days.Results and Discussion:RNA-sequencing was performed to investigate the gene expression pattern of adipocytes carrying differentFTOalleles and found that active beige adipocytes had higher brown adipocyte content and browning capacity compared to white or inactive beige ones when the cells were obtained from risk-free TT but not from obesity-risk CC genotype carriers. Active beige adipocytes carryingFTOCC had lower thermogenic gene (e.g.,UCP1, PM20D1, CIDEA) expression and thermogenesis measured by proton leak respiration as compared to TT carriers. In addition, active beige adipocytes with CC alleles exerted lower expression of ASC-1 neutral amino acid transporter (encoded bySLC7A10) and less consumption of Ala, Ser, Cys, and Gly as compared to risk-free carriers.

"37519468","Sleep Health at the Genomic Level: Six Distinct Factors and Their Relationships With Psychopathology.","Biol Psychiatry Glob Open Sci","Poor sleep is associated with many negative health outcomes, including multiple dimensions of psychopathology. In the past decade, sleep researchers have advocated for focusing on the concept of sleep health as a modifiable health behavior to mitigate or prevent these outcomes. Sleep health dimensions often include sleep efficiency, duration, satisfaction, regularity, timing, and daytime alertness. However, there is no consensus on how to best operationalize sleep health at the phenotypic and genetic levels. In some studies, specific sleep health domains were examined individually, while in others, sleep health domains were examined together (e.g., with an aggregate sleep health score).Here, we compared alternative sleep health factor models using genomic structural equation modeling on summary statistics from previously published genome-wide association studies of self-reported and actigraphic sleep measures with effective sample sizes up to 452,633.Our best-fitting sleep health model had 6 correlated genetic factors pertaining to 6 sleep health domains: circadian preference, efficiency, alertness, duration, noninsomnia, and regularity. All sleep health factors were significantly correlated (|rgs| = 0.11-0.51), except for the circadian preference factor with duration and noninsomnia. Better sleep health was generally significantly associated with lower genetic liability for psychopathology (|rgs| = 0.05-0.48), yet the 6 sleep health factors showed divergent patterns of associations with different psychopathology factors, especially when controlling for covariance among the sleep health factors.These results provide evidence for genetic separability of sleep health constructs and their differentiation with respect to associations with mental health.© 2022 The Authors."

A GWAS was performed for 720 patients (after quality control) with controls from the Add Health study and then meta-analyzed with 2 large biobanks, UK Biobank (247 cases) and FinnGen (673 cases). Variants at 3 loci were tested for replication in the BioVU biobank (290 cases). Data analysis was performed from September 2021 to December 2022.Main outcome measures are loci identified, with association of P < 1 × 10-8 considered significant.A total of 753 patients were recruited, with 720 included in the analysis. Mean (SD) age at symptom onset was 20.3 (10.57) years and at enrollment was 35.3 (13.52) years; 360 (50.0%) patients were Black, and 575 (79.7%) were female. In a meta-analysis of the 4 studies, 2 HS-associated loci were identified and replicated, with lead variants rs10512572 (P = 2.3 × 10-11) and rs17090189 (P = 2.1 × 10-8) near the SOX9 and KLF5 genes, respectively. Variants at these loci are located in enhancer regulatory elements detected in skin tissue.In this genetic association study, common variants associated with HS located near the SOX9 and KLF5 genes were associated with risk of HS. These or other nearby genes may be associated with genetic risk of disease and the development of clinical features, such as cysts, comedones, and inflammatory tunnels, that are unique to HS. New insights into disease pathogenesis related to these genes may help predict disease progression and novel treatment approaches in the future."

We examined associations between distance visual acuity, cognitive measures including school grades, and neurodevelopmental conditions in a longitudinal cohort of British children (ALSPAC, n = 6807, M age = 11.8). We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS, n = 5571) on visual acuity and tested for genetic associations with relevant phenotypes using polygenic scores (PGS) and genetic correlation analyses. Visual acuity was associated with better cognitive performance and school grades, and reduced in individuals with reading difficulties compared to controls. GWAS revealed genetic associations at the NPLOC4 locus and highlighted other genes involved in sensory function. In line with positive genetic correlations between visual acuity and cognitive measures, EA PGS were positively associated with visual acuity, while there was a less robust negative association with myopia PGS. In conclusion, increased visual acuity is associated with a range of positive outcomes, including better school grades. Our results suggest an association between a higher EA PGS and slightly increased visual acuity in childhood. This could indicate gene-environment correlation, in which environmental exposures linked to higher EA might have detrimental effects on vision offsetting the initial positive effect.© 2023.

"37488738","Genetic differences according to onset age and lung function in asthma: A cluster analysis.","Clin Transl Allergy","The extent of differences between genetic risks associated with various asthma subtypes is still unknown. To better understand the heterogeneity of asthma, we employed an unsupervised method to identify genetic variants specifically associated with asthma subtypes. Our goal was to gain insight into the genetic basis of asthma.In this study, we utilized the UK Biobank dataset to select asthma patients (All asthma, n = 50,517) and controls (n = 283,410). We excluded 14,431 individuals who had no information on predicted values of forced expiratory volume in one second percent (FEV1%) and onset age, resulting in a final total of 36,086 asthma cases. We conducted k-means clustering based on asthma onset age and predicted FEV1% using these samples (n = 36,086). Cluster-specific genome-wide association studies were then performed, and heritability was estimated via linkage disequilibrium score regression. To further investigate the pathophysiology, we conducted eQTL analysis with GTEx and gene-set enrichment analysis with FUMA.Clustering resulted in four distinct clusters: early onset asthmanormalLF(early onset with normal lung function, n = 8172), early onset asthmareducedLF(early onset with reduced lung function, n = 8925), late-onset asthmanormalLF(late-onset with normal lung function, n = 12,481), and late-onset asthmareducedLF(late-onset with reduced lung function, n = 6508). Our GWASs in four clusters and in All asthma sample identified 5 novel loci, 14 novel signals, and 51 cluster-specific signals. Among clusters, early onset asthmanormalLFand late-onset asthmareducedLFwere the least correlated (rg = 0.37). Early onset asthmareducedLFshowed the highest heritability explained by common variants (h2 = 0.212) and was associated with the largest number of variants (71 single nucleotide polymorphisms). Further, the pathway analysis conducted through eQTL and gene-set enrichment analysis showed that the worsening of symptoms in early onset asthma correlated with lymphocyte activation, pathogen recognition, cytokine receptor activation, and lymphocyte differentiation.Our findings suggest that early onset asthmareducedLFwas the most genetically predisposed cluster, and that asthma clusters with reduced lung function were genetically distinct from clusters with normal lung function. Our study revealed the genetic variation between clusters that were segmented based on onset age and lung function, providing an important clue for the genetic mechanism of asthma heterogeneity.© 2023 The Authors.

"37488169","Investigating genetically stratified subgroups to better understand the etiology of alcohol misuse.","Mol Psychiatry","Alcohol misuse (AM) is highly prevalent and harmful, with theorized subgroups differing on internalizing and externalizing dimensions. Despite known heterogeneity, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are usually conducted on unidimensional phenotypes. These approaches have identified important genes related to AM but fail to capture a large part of the heritability, even with recent increases in sample sizes. This study aimed to address phenotypic heterogeneity in GWAS to aid gene finding and to uncover the etiology of different types of AM. Genetic and phenotypic data from 410,414 unrelated individuals of multiple ancestry groups (primarily European) in the UK Biobank were obtained. Mixture modeling was applied to measures of alcohol misuse and internalizing/externalizing psychopathology to uncover phenotypically homogenous subclasses, which were carried forward to GWAS and functional annotation. A four-class model emerged with ""low risk"", ""internalizing-light/non-drinkers"", ""heavy alcohol use-low impairment"", and ""broad high risk"" classes. SNP heritability ranged from 3 to 18% and both known AM signals and novel signals were captured by genomic risk loci. Class comparisons showed distinct patterns of regional brain tissue enrichment and genetic correlations with internalizing and externalizing phenotypes. Despite some limitations, this study demonstrated the utility of genetic research on homogenous subclasses. Not only were novel genetic signals identified that might be used for follow-up studies, but addressing phenotypic heterogeneity allows for the discovery and investigation of differential genetic vulnerabilities in the development of AM, which is an important step towards the goal of personalized medicine.© 2023.

"37474577","Causal associations of brain structure with bone mineral density: a large-scale genetic correlation study.","Bone Res","In this study, we aimed to investigate the causal associations of brain structure with bone mineral density (BMD). Based on the genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics of 1 325 brain imaging-derived phenotypes (BIDPs) of brain structure from the UK Biobank and GWAS summary datasets of 5 BMD locations, including the total body, femoral neck, lumbar spine, forearm, and heel from the GEFOS Consortium, linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) was conducted to determine the genetic correlations, and Mendelian randomization (MR) was then performed to explore the causal relationship between the BIDPs and BMD. Several sensitivity analyses were performed to verify the strength and stability of the present MR outcomes. To increase confidence in our findings, we also performed confirmatory MR between BIDPs and osteoporosis. LDSC revealed that 1.93% of BIDPs, with a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.01, were genetically correlated with BMD. Additionally, we observed that 1.31% of BIDPs exhibited a significant causal relationship with BMD (FDR < 0.01) through MR. Both the LDSC and MR results demonstrated that the BIDPs ""Volume of normalized brain,"" ""Volume of gray matter in Left Inferior Frontal Gyrus, pars opercularis,"" ""Volume of Estimated Total Intra Cranial"" and ""Volume-ratio of brain segmentation/estimated total intracranial"" had strong associations with BMD. Interestingly, our results showed that more left BIDPs were causally associated with BMD, especially within and around the left frontal region. In conclusion, a part of the brain structure causally influences BMD, which may provide important perspectives for the prevention of osteoporosis and offer valuable insights for further research on the brain-bone axis.© 2023.

"37468507","Biobank-scale methods and projections for sparse polygenic prediction from machine learning.","Sci Rep","In this paper we characterize the performance of linear models trained via widely-used sparse machine learning algorithms. We build polygenic scores and examine performance as a function of training set size, genetic ancestral background, and training method. We show that predictor performance is most strongly dependent on size of training data, with smaller gains from algorithmic improvements. We find that LASSO generally performs as well as the best methods, judged by a variety of metrics. We also investigate performance characteristics of predictors trained on one genetic ancestry group when applied to another. Using LASSO, we develop a novel method for projecting AUC and correlation as a function of data size (i.e., for new biobanks) and characterize the asymptotic limit of performance. Additionally, for LASSO (compressed sensing) we show that performance metrics and predictor sparsity are in agreement with theoretical predictions from the Donoho-Tanner phase transition. Specifically, a future predictor trained in the Taiwan Precision Medicine Initiative for asthma can achieve an AUC of [Formula: see text] and for height a correlation of [Formula: see text] for a Taiwanese population. This is above the measured values of [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], respectively, for UK Biobank trained predictors applied to a European population.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37461564","Genetic structure of major depression symptoms across clinical and community cohorts.","medRxiv","Diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder allow for heterogeneous symptom profiles but genetic analysis of major depressive symptoms has the potential to identify clinical and aetiological subtypes. There are several challenges to integrating symptom data from genetically-informative cohorts, such as sample size differences between clinical and community cohorts and various patterns of missing data. We conducted genome-wide association studies of major depressive symptoms in three clinical cohorts that were enriched for affected participants (Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, Australian Genetics of Depression Study, Generation Scotland) and three community cohorts (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, Estonian Biobank, and UK Biobank). We fit a series of confirmatory factor models with factors that accounted for how symptom data was sampled and then compared alternative models with different symptom factors. The best fitting model had a distinct factor forAppetite/Weightsymptoms and an additional measurement factor that accounted for missing data patterns in the community cohorts (use of Depression and Anhedonia as gating symptoms). The results show the importance of assessing the directionality of symptoms (such as hypersomnia versus insomnia) and of accounting for study and measurement design when meta-analysing genetic association data."
"37457001","Structural neuroimaging phenotypes and associated molecular and genomic underpinnings in autism: a review.","Front Neurosci","Autism has been associated with differences in the developmental trajectories of multiple neuroanatomical features, including cortical thickness, surface area, cortical volume, measures of gyrification, and the gray-white matter tissue contrast. These neuroimaging features have been proposed as intermediate phenotypes on the gradient from genomic variation to behavioral symptoms. Hence, examining what these proxy markers represent, i.e., disentangling their associated molecular and genomic underpinnings, could provide crucial insights into the etiology and pathophysiology of autism. In line with this, an increasing number of studies are exploring the association between neuroanatomical, cellular/molecular, and (epi)genetic variation in autism, both indirectly and directlyin vivoand across age. In this review, we aim to summarize the existing literature in autism (and neurotypicals) to chart a putative pathway from (i) imaging-derived neuroanatomical cortical phenotypes to (ii) underlying (neuropathological) biological processes, and (iii) associated genomic variation.Copyright © 2023 Pretzsch and Ecker."
"37443256","Studying the genetics of participation using footprints left on the ascertained genotypes.","Nat Genet","The trait of participating in a genetic study probably has a genetic component. Identifying this component is difficult as we cannot compare genetic information of participants with nonparticipants directly, the latter being unavailable. Here, we show that alleles that are more common in participants than nonparticipants would be further enriched in genetic segments shared by two related participants. Genome-wide analysis was performed by comparing allele frequencies in shared and not-shared genetic segments of first-degree relative pairs of the UK Biobank. In nonoverlapping samples, a polygenic score constructed from that analysis is significantly associated with educational attainment, body mass index and being invited to a dietary study. The estimated correlation between the genetic components underlying participation in UK Biobank and educational attainment is estimated to be 36.6%-substantial but far from total. Taking participation behaviour into account would improve the analyses of the study data, including those of health traits.© 2023. The Author(s)."

We conducted a Mendelian randomization study to determine the bidirectional causal association between atopic dermatitis and CKD.Independent genetic instruments associated with atopic dermatitis and CKD at the genome-wide significance level were chosen from corresponding meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies. Summary-level data for atopic dermatitis were obtained from the EAGLE Eczema consortium (30,047 cases and 40,835 controls) and FinnGen consortium (7,024 cases and 198,740 controls). Summary-level data for CKD were derived from CKDGen consortium (64,164 cases and 625,219 controls) and FinnGen consortium (3,902 cases and 212,841 controls). The inverse-variance weighted method was used in the main analysis and supplemented with three sensitivity analyses.Genetic predisposition to atopic dermatitis was associated with an increased risk of CKD. For a one-unit increase in the prevalence of atopic dermatitis, the odds ratio of CKD was 1.07 (95% confidence interval: 1.01-1.12). In the reverse Mendelian randomization analysis, the odds ratio of atopic dermatitis was 1.14 (95% confidence interval: 1.03-1.26) for a one-unit increase in the prevalence of CKD. The associations persisted in sensitivity analyses and no pleiotropy was detected.This Mendelian randomization study suggests a bidirectional positive association between atopic dermatitis and CKD.Copyright © 2023 Zhang, Yuan, Li, Li, Yu, Hu, Li, Wang and Larsson."
"37433859","CARE as a wearable derived feature linking circadian amplitude to human cognitive functions.","NPJ Digit Med","Circadian rhythms are crucial for regulating physiological and behavioral processes. Pineal hormone melatonin is often used to measure circadian amplitude but its collection is costly and time-consuming. Wearable activity data are promising alternative, but the most commonly used measure, relative amplitude, is subject to behavioral masking. In this study, we firstly derive a feature named circadian activity rhythm energy (CARE) to better characterize circadian amplitude and validate CARE by correlating it with melatonin amplitude (Pearson's r = 0.46, P = 0.007) among 33 healthy participants. Then we investigate its association with cognitive functions in an adolescent dataset (Chinese SCHEDULE-A, n = 1703) and an adult dataset (UK Biobank, n = 92,202), and find that CARE is significantly associated with Global Executive Composite (β = 30.86, P = 0.016) in adolescents, and reasoning ability, short-term memory, and prospective memory (OR = 0.01, 3.42, and 11.47 respectively, all P < 0.001) in adults. Finally, we identify one genetic locus with 126 CARE-associated SNPs using the genome-wide association study, of which 109 variants are used as instrumental variables in the Mendelian Randomization analysis, and the results show a significant causal effect of CARE on reasoning ability, short-term memory, and prospective memory (β = -59.91, 7.94, and 16.85 respectively, all P < 0.0001). The present study suggests that CARE is an effective wearable-based metric of circadian amplitude with a strong genetic basis and clinical significance, and its adoption can facilitate future circadian studies and potential intervention strategies to improve circadian rhythms and cognitive functions.© 2023.

In order to identify sequence variants associated with urticaria, we performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies for urticaria with a total of 40,694 cases and 1,230,001 controls from Iceland, the UK, Finland, and Japan. We also performed transcriptome- and proteome-wide analyses in Iceland and the UK. We found nine sequence variants at nine loci associating with urticaria. The variants are at genes participating in type 2 immune responses and/or mast cell biology (CBLB, FCER1A, GCSAML, STAT6, TPSD1, ZFPM1), the innate immunity (C4), and NF-κB signaling. The most significant association was observed for the splice-donor variant rs56043070[A] (hg38: chr1:247556467) in GCSAML (MAF = 6.6%, OR = 1.24 (95%CI: 1.20-1.28), P-value = 3.6 × 10-44). We assessed the effects of the variants on transcripts, and levels of proteins relevant to urticaria pathophysiology. Our results emphasize the role of type 2 immune response and mast cell activation in the pathogenesis of urticaria. Our findings may point to an IgE-independent urticaria pathway that could help address unmet clinical need.© 2023. The Author(s)."

"37404742","Observational and genetic evidence support a relationship between cardiac autonomic function and blood pressure.","Front Cardiovasc Med","It is unclear how cardiac autonomic function, as indicated by heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), HR increase during exercise, and HR recovery after exercise, is related to blood pressure (BP). We aimed to examine the observational and genetic evidence for a potential causal effect of these HR(V) traits on BP.We performed multivariable adjusted linear regression using Lifelines and UK Biobank cohorts to investigate the relationship between HR(V) traits and BP. Linkage disequilibrium score regression was conducted to examine genetic correlations. We used two-sample Mendelian randomization (2SMR) to examine potential causal relations between HR(V) traits and BP.Observational analyses showed negative associations of all HR(V) traits with BP, except for HR, which was positively associated. Genetic correlations were directionally consistent with the observational associations, but most significant genetic correlations between HR(V) traits and BP were limited to diastolic blood pressure (DBP). 2SMR analyses suggested a potentially causal relationship between HR(V) traits and DBP but not systolic blood pressure (SBP). No reverse effect of BP on HR(V) traits was found. One standard deviation (SD) unit increase in HR was associated with a 1.82 mmHg elevation of DBP. In contrast, one ln(ms) unit increase of the root mean square of the successive differences (RMSSD) and corrected RMSSD (RMSSDc), decreased DBP by 1.79 and 1.83 mmHg, respectively. For HR increase and HR recovery at 50 s, every additional SD increase was associated with a lower DBP by 2.05 and 1.47 mmHg, respectively. Results of secondary analyses with pulse pressure as outcome were inconsistent between observational and 2SMR analyses, as well as between HR(V) traits, and therefore inconclusive.Both observational and genetic evidence show strong associations between indices of cardiac autonomic function and DBP, suggesting that a larger relative contribution of the sympathetic versus the parasympathetic nervous system to cardiac function may cause elevated DBP.© 2023 Chen, Wang, He, Tegegne, van Roon, Holtjer, van der Harst, Snieder and Thio."
"37390107","A multivariate genome-wide association study of psycho-cardiometabolic multimorbidity.","PLoS Genet","Coronary artery disease (CAD), type 2 diabetes (T2D) and depression are among the leading causes of chronic morbidity and mortality worldwide. Epidemiological studies indicate a substantial degree of multimorbidity, which may be explained by shared genetic influences. However, research exploring the presence of pleiotropic variants and genes common to CAD, T2D and depression is lacking. The present study aimed to identify genetic variants with effects on cross-trait liability to psycho-cardiometabolic diseases. We used genomic structural equation modelling to perform a multivariate genome-wide association study of multimorbidity (Neffective = 562,507), using summary statistics from univariate genome-wide association studies for CAD, T2D and major depression. CAD was moderately genetically correlated with T2D (rg = 0.39, P = 2e-34) and weakly correlated with depression (rg = 0.13, P = 3e-6). Depression was weakly correlated with T2D (rg = 0.15, P = 4e-15). The latent multimorbidity factor explained the largest proportion of variance in T2D (45%), followed by CAD (35%) and depression (5%). We identified 11 independent SNPs associated with multimorbidity and 18 putative multimorbidity-associated genes. We observed enrichment in immune and inflammatory pathways. A greater polygenic risk score for multimorbidity in the UK Biobank (N = 306,734) was associated with the co-occurrence of CAD, T2D and depression (OR per standard deviation = 1.91, 95% CI = 1.74-2.10, relative to the healthy group), validating this latent multimorbidity factor. Mendelian randomization analyses suggested potentially causal effects of BMI, body fat percentage, LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, fasting insulin, income, insomnia, and childhood maltreatment. These findings advance our understanding of multimorbidity suggesting common genetic pathways.Copyright: © 2023 Baltramonaityte et al.

R2is the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by the PGS, calculated in a cohort that is independent of the genome-wide association study (GWAS) that provided estimates of allelic effect sizes. The SNP-based heritability (hSNP2, the proportion of total phenotypic variances attributable to all common SNPs) is the theoretical upper limit of the out-of-sample prediction R2. However, in real data analyses R2has been reported to exceed hSNP2, which occurs in parallel with the observation that hSNP2estimates tend to decline as the number of cohorts being meta-analyzed increases. Here, we quantify why and when these observations are expected. Using theory and simulation, we show that if heterogeneities in cohort-specific hSNP2exist, or if genetic correlations between cohorts are less than one, hSNP2estimates can decrease as the number of cohorts being meta-analyzed increases. We derive conditions when the out-of-sample prediction R2will be greater than hSNP2and show the validity of our derivations with real data from a binary trait (major depression) and a continuous trait (educational attainment).

Studying rare coding variants has the potential to identify drug targets. We performed an exome-wide association study of smoking phenotypes in up to 749,459 individuals and discovered a protective association in CHRNB2, encoding the β2 subunit of the α4β2 nicotine acetylcholine receptor. Rare predicted loss-of-function and likely deleterious missense variants in CHRNB2 in aggregate were associated with a 35% decreased odds for smoking heavily (odds ratio (OR) = 0.65, confidence interval (CI) = 0.56-0.76, P = 1.9 × 10-8). An independent common variant association in the protective direction ( rs2072659 ; OR = 0.96; CI = 0.94-0.98; P = 5.3 × 10-6) was also evident, suggesting an allelic series. Our findings in humans align with decades-old experimental observations in mice that β2 loss abolishes nicotine-mediated neuronal responses and attenuates nicotine self-administration. Our genetic discovery will inspire future drug designs targeting CHRNB2 in the brain for the treatment of nicotine addiction.© 2023. The Author(s)."

The strongest genome-wide significant variants at chromosome 10q25.3 in TCF7L2 (rs7903146; P = 2.4 × 10-12, β = -0.436; SE 0.02) and chromosome 6p22.3 in CDKAL1 (rs9368219; P = 2.29 × 10-8; β = -0.053; SE 0.01) were directionally consistent across ethnic groups and present at similar frequencies; however, both loci harbored additional independent signals that were only present in the South Indian cohorts. A genome-wide signal was also obtained at chromosome 10q26.12 in WDR11 (rs3011366; P = 3.255 × 10-8; β = 1.44; SE 0.25), specifically in the South Indian cohorts. Heritability estimates for the age at diagnosis were much stronger in South Indians than Europeans, and a polygenic risk score constructed based on South Indian GWAS explained ∼2% trait variance.Our findings provide a better understanding of ethnic differences in the age at diagnosis and indicate the potential importance of ethnic differences in the genetic architecture underpinning T2D.© 2023 by the American Diabetes Association."

Studies that demonstrated its complex genetic architecture have been mainly performed in populations of European ancestry. We investigate the genetics of ASD in an East African cohort (129 individuals) from a population with higher prevalence (5%). Whole-genome sequencing identified 2.13 million private variants in the cohort and potentially pathogenic variants in known ASD genes (includingCACNA1C,CHD7,FMR1, andTCF7L2). Admixture analysis demonstrated that the cohort comprises two ancestral populations, African and Eurasian. Admixture mapping discovered 10 regions that confer ASD risk on the African haplotypes, containing several known ASD genes. The increased ASD prevalence in this population suggests decreased heterogeneity in the underlying genetic etiology, enabling risk allele identification.

"37436997","Transcriptional and epigenomic profiling identifies YAP signaling as a key regulator of intestinal epithelium maturation.","Sci Adv","During intestinal organogenesis, equipotent epithelial progenitors mature into phenotypically distinct stem cells that are responsible for lifelong maintenance of the tissue. While the morphological changes associated with the transition are well characterized, the molecular mechanisms underpinning the maturation process are not fully understood. Here, we leverage intestinal organoid cultures to profile transcriptional, chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation, and three-dimensional (3D) chromatin conformation landscapes in fetal and adult epithelial cells. We observed prominent differences in gene expression and enhancer activity, which are accompanied by local changes in 3D organization, DNA accessibility, and methylation between the two cellular states. Using integrative analyses, we identified sustained Yes-Associated Protein (YAP) transcriptional activity as a major gatekeeper of the immature fetal state. We found the YAP-associated transcriptional network to be regulated at various levels of chromatin organization and likely to be coordinated by changes in extracellular matrix composition. Together, our work highlights the value of unbiased profiling of regulatory landscapes for the identification of key mechanisms underlying tissue maturation."

Genetic studies of these glycemic biomarkers can shed light on unknown aspects of type 2 diabetes genetics and biology. While there exists several GWAS of glycated hemoglobin and fasting glucose, very few GWAS have focused on glycated albumin or fructosamine. We performed a multi-phenotype GWAS of glycated albumin and fructosamine from 7,395 White and 2,016 Black participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study on the common variants from genotyped/imputed data. We found 2 genome-wide significant loci, one mapping to known type 2 diabetes gene (ARAP1/STARD10,p= 2.8 × 10-8) and another mapping to a novel gene (UGT1A,p= 1.4 × 10-8) using multi-omics gene mapping strategies in diabetes-relevant tissues. We identified additional loci that were ancestry-specific (e.g.,PRKCAfrom African ancestry individuals,p= 1.7 × 10-8) and sex-specific (TEX29locus in males only,p= 3.0 × 10-8). Further, we implemented multi-phenotype gene-burden tests on whole-exome sequence data from 6,590 White and 2,309 Black ARIC participants. Eleven genes across different rare variant aggregation strategies were exome-wide significant only in multi-ancestry analysis. Four out of 11 genes had notable enrichment of rare predicted loss of function variants in African ancestry participants despite smaller sample size. Overall, 8 out of 15 loci/genes were implicated to influence these biomarkers via glycemic pathways. This study illustrates improved locus discovery and potential effector gene discovery by leveraging joint patterns of related biomarkers across entire allele frequency spectrum in multi-ancestry analyses. Most of the loci/genes we identified have not been previously implicated in studies of type 2 diabetes, and future investigation of the loci/genes potentially acting through glycemic pathways may help us better understand risk of developing type 2 diabetes."

As a collaboration model of the International Hundred K+ Cohorts Consortium (IHCC), we endeavored to develop a globally applicable trans-ethnic PRS for body mass index (BMI) through this relatively new international effort.The polygenic risk score (PRS) model was developed, trained and tested at the Center for Applied Genomics (CAG) of The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) based on a BMI meta-analysis from the GIANT consortium. The validated PRS models were subsequently disseminated to the participating sites.

"37456839","TET1 facilitates specification of early human lineages including germ cells.","iScience","Ten Eleven Translocation 1 (TET1) is a regulator of localized DNA demethylation through the conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). To examine DNA demethylation in human primordial germ cell-like cells (hPGCLCs) induced from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), we performed bisulfite-assisted APOBEC coupled epigenetic sequencing (bACEseq) followed by integrated genomics analysis. Our data indicates that 5hmC enriches at hPGCLC-specific NANOG, SOX17 or TFAP2C binding sites on hPGCLC induction, and this is accompanied by localized DNA demethylation. Using CRISPR-Cas9, we show that deleting the catalytic domain of TET1 reduces hPGCLC competency when starting with hESC cultured on mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and this phenotype can be rescued after transitioning hESCs to defined media and a recombinant substrate. Taken together, our study demonstrates the importance of 5hmC in facilitating hPGCLC competency, and the role of hESC culture conditions in modulating this effect.© 2023 The Author(s)."

"37410774","Characterizing the landscape of gene expression variance in humans.","PLoS Genet","Gene expression variance has been linked to organismal function and fitness but remains a commonly neglected aspect of molecular research. As a result, we lack a comprehensive understanding of the patterns of transcriptional variance across genes, and how this variance is linked to context-specific gene regulation and gene function. Here, we use 57 large publicly available RNA-seq data sets to investigate the landscape of gene expression variance. These studies cover a wide range of tissues and allowed us to assess if there are consistently more or less variable genes across tissues and data sets and what mechanisms drive these patterns. We show that gene expression variance is broadly similar across tissues and studies, indicating that the pattern of transcriptional variance is consistent. We use this similarity to create both global and within-tissue rankings of variation, which we use to show that function, sequence variation, and gene regulatory signatures contribute to gene expression variance. Low-variance genes are associated with fundamental cell processes and have lower levels of genetic polymorphisms, have higher gene-gene connectivity, and tend to be associated with chromatin states associated with transcription. In contrast, high-variance genes are enriched for genes involved in immune response, environmentally responsive genes, immediate early genes, and are associated with higher levels of polymorphisms. These results show that the pattern of transcriptional variance is not noise. Instead, it is a consistent gene trait that seems to be functionally constrained in human populations. Furthermore, this commonly neglected aspect of molecular phenotypic variation harbors important information to understand complex traits and disease.Copyright: © 2023 Wolf et al.

Variability in responses toMtbinfection could be due to host or pathogen heterogeneity. Here, we focused on host genetic variation in a Peruvian population and its associations with gene regulation in monocyte-derived macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). We recruited former household contacts of TB patients who previously progressed to TB (cases, n=63) or did not progress to TB (controls, n=63). Transcriptomic profiling of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages measured the impact of genetic variants on gene expression by identifying expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). We identified 330 and 257 eQTL genes in DCs and macrophages (False Discovery Rate (FDR) < 0.05), respectively. Five genes in DCs showed interaction between eQTL variants and TB progression status. The top eQTL interaction for a protein-coding gene was withFAH, the gene encoding fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase, which mediates the last step in mammalian tyrosine catabolism.FAHexpression was associated with genetic regulatory variation in cases but not controls. Using public transcriptomic and epigenomic data ofMtb-infected monocyte-derived dendritic cells, we found thatMtbinfection results inFAHdownregulation and DNA methylation changes in the locus. Overall, this study demonstrates effects of genetic variation on gene expression levels that are dependent on history of infectious disease and highlights a candidate pathogenic mechanism through pathogen-response genes. Furthermore, our results point to tyrosine metabolism and related candidate TB progression pathways for further investigation."
"37470939","Perceived Parental Support and Psychological Control, DNA Methylation, and Loneliness: Longitudinal Associations Across Early Adolescence.","J Youth Adolesc","A broad range of factors have been associated with the development of adolescent loneliness. In the family context, a lack of parental support and high levels of parental psychological control have systematically been linked to loneliness. On the biological level, DNA methylation (which is an epigenetic process that suppresses gene expression) is believed to play a role in the development of loneliness. Specifically, high levels of DNA methylation in genes that play an important role in the functioning of the human stress response system are believed to elevate the risk of loneliness. Moreover, DNA methylation levels in these stress-related genes can be influenced by stressful environmental factors, suggesting a potential mediating role of DNA methylation in the association between parenting behaviors and loneliness. The current 3-year longitudinal study is the first study to examine the potential bidirectional longitudinal associations between loneliness, DNA methylation in stress-related genes, and both perceived parental support and psychological control. Furthermore, we explored the potential mediating role of DNA methylation in stress-related genes in the associations between perceived parenting and loneliness. The sample comprised 622 early adolescents (55% girls, Mage T1 = 10.77 years, SDage T1 = 0.48) who were followed from Grade 5 to 7. Parental support, psychological control, and loneliness were assessed annually by adolescent self-report questionnaires and DNA methylation was determined from saliva samples. Cross-Lagged Panel Models (CLPM) revealed that higher levels of loneliness predicted lower perceived parental support and higher perceived psychological control over time, as well as higher DNA methylation in some stress-related genes, that is, the glucocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C1) and the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). In addition, higher NR3C1 methylation was predictive of lower perceived parental support and higher psychological control over time. No evidence was found for a mediating role of DNA methylation. Overall, our longitudinal findings challenge the current focus on DNA methylation and parenting behaviors as risk factors for adolescent loneliness. Instead, they suggest that the less considered direction of effects, which implies that loneliness predicts DNA methylation and aspects of parenting such as support and psychological control, should receive greater attention in future research.© 2023.

"37525275","Phenotypic heterogeneity in human genetic diseases: ultrasensitivity-mediated threshold effects as a unifying molecular mechanism.","J Biomed Sci","Phenotypic heterogeneity is very common in genetic systems and in human diseases and has important consequences for disease diagnosis and treatment. In addition to the many genetic and non-genetic (e.g., epigenetic, environmental) factors reported to account for part of the heterogeneity, we stress the importance of stochastic fluctuation and regulatory network topology in contributing to phenotypic heterogeneity. We argue that a threshold effect is a unifying principle to explain the phenomenon; that ultrasensitivity is the molecular mechanism for this threshold effect; and discuss the three conditions for phenotypic heterogeneity to occur. We suggest that threshold effects occur not only at the cellular level, but also at the organ level. We stress the importance of context-dependence and its relationship to pleiotropy and edgetic mutations. Based on this model, we provide practical strategies to study human genetic diseases. By understanding the network mechanism for ultrasensitivity and identifying the critical factor, we may manipulate the weak spot to gently nudge the system from an ultrasensitive state to a stable non-disease state. Our analysis provides a new insight into the prevention and treatment of genetic diseases.© 2023. The Author(s)."

We here introduce MOBILE (Multi-Omics Binary Integration via Lasso Ensembles) to nominate molecular features associated with cellular phenotypes and pathways. First, we use MOBILE to nominate mechanisms of interferon-γ (IFNγ) regulated PD-L1 expression. Our analyses suggest that IFNγ-controlled PD-L1 expression involves BST2, CLIC2, FAM83D, ACSL5, and HIST2H2AA3 genes, which were supported by prior literature. We also compare networks activated by related family members transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGFβ1) and bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) and find that differences in ligand-induced changes in cell size and clustering properties are related to differences in laminin/collagen pathway activity. Finally, we demonstrate the broad applicability and adaptability of MOBILE by analyzing publicly available molecular datasets to investigate breast cancer subtype specific networks. Given the ever-growing availability of multi-omics datasets, we envision that MOBILE will be broadly useful for identification of context-specific molecular features and pathways.© 2023.

Over the last decade, the development of sequencing technologies has flooded researchers with transcriptome-phenotype data alongside emerging candidate regulatory elements. Since most methods can only provide hints about enhancer function, there have been attempts to develop experimental and computational approaches that can bridge the gap in the causal relationship between regulatory regions and phenotypes. The coupling of two state-of-the-art technologies, also referred to as crisprQTL, has emerged as a promising high-throughput toolkit for addressing this question. This review provides an overview of the importance of studying enhancers, the core molecular foundation of crisprQTL, and recent studies utilizing crisprQTL to interrogate enhancer-phenotype correlations. Additionally, we discuss computational methods currently employed for crisprQTL data analysis. We conclude by pointing out common challenges, making recommendations, and looking at future prospects, with the aim of providing researchers with an overview of crisprQTL as an important toolkit for studying enhancers."

We found a significant enrichment of cases where differential usage of exons in various developmental stages of human cells and tissues is associated with differential epigenetic modifications in the flanking regions of individual exons.

Countering models that presume antibodies are generated largely by stochastic processes, we demonstrate that polymorphisms within the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (IGH) impact the naive and antigen-experienced antibody repertoire, indicating that genetics predisposes individuals to mount qualitatively and quantitatively different antibody responses. We pair recently developed long-read genomic sequencing methods with antibody repertoire profiling to comprehensively resolve IGH genetic variation, including novel structural variants, single nucleotide variants, and genes and alleles. We show that IGH germline variants determine the presence and frequency of antibody genes in the expressed repertoire, including those enriched in functional elements linked to V(D)J recombination, and overlapping disease-associated variants. These results illuminate the power of leveraging IGH genetics to better understand the regulation, function, and dynamics of the antibody response in disease.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37460559","Epigenetic mechanisms to propagate histone acetylation by p300/CBP.","Nat Commun","Histone acetylation is important for the activation of gene transcription but little is known about its direct read/write mechanisms. Here, we report cryogenic electron microscopy structures in which a p300/CREB-binding protein (CBP) multidomain monomer recognizes histone H4 N-terminal tail (NT) acetylation (ac) in a nucleosome and acetylates non-H4 histone NTs within the same nucleosome. p300/CBP not only recognized H4NTac via the bromodomain pocket responsible for reading, but also interacted with the DNA minor grooves via the outside of that pocket. This directed the catalytic center of p300/CBP to one of the non-H4 histone NTs. The primary target that p300 writes by reading H4NTac was H2BNT, and H2BNTac promoted H2A-H2B dissociation from the nucleosome. We propose a model in which p300/CBP replicates histone N-terminal tail acetylation within the H3-H4 tetramer to inherit epigenetic storage, and transcribes it from the H3-H4 tetramer to the H2B-H2A dimers to activate context-dependent gene transcription through local nucleosome destabilization.© 2023.

"37432267","Adverse Maternal Environments Perturb Hepatic DNA Methylome and Transcriptome Prior to the Adult-Onset Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Mouse Offspring.","Nutrients","Exposure to adverse early-life environments (AME) increases the incidence of developing adult-onset non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). DNA methylation has been postulated to link AME and late-onset diseases. This study aimed to investigate whether and to what extent the hepatic DNA methylome was perturbed prior to the development of NAFLD in offspring exposed to AME in mice. AME constituted maternal Western diet and late-gestational stress. Male offspring livers at birth (d0) and weaning (d21) were used for evaluating the DNA methylome and transcriptome using the reduced representation of bisulfite sequencing and RNA-seq, respectively. We found AME caused 5879 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and zero differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at d0 and 2970 and 123, respectively, at d21. The majority of the DMRs were distal to gene transcription start sites and did not correlate with DEGs. The DEGs at d21 were significantly enriched in GO biological processes characteristic of liver metabolic functions. In conclusion, AME drove changes in the hepatic DNA methylome, which preceded perturbations in the hepatic metabolic transcriptome, which preceded the onset of NAFLD. We speculate that subtle impacts on dynamic enhancers lead to long-range regulatory changes that manifest over time as gene network alternations and increase the incidence of NAFLD later in life."
"37428809","Leveraging epigenomes and three-dimensional genome organization for interpreting regulatory variation.","PLoS Comput Biol","Understanding the impact of regulatory variants on complex phenotypes is a significant challenge because the genes and pathways that are targeted by such variants and the cell type context in which regulatory variants operate are typically unknown. Cell-type-specific long-range regulatory interactions that occur between a distal regulatory sequence and a gene offer a powerful framework for examining the impact of regulatory variants on complex phenotypes. However, high-resolution maps of such long-range interactions are available only for a handful of cell types. Furthermore, identifying specific gene subnetworks or pathways that are targeted by a set of variants is a significant challenge. We have developed L-HiC-Reg, a Random Forests regression method to predict high-resolution contact counts in new cell types, and a network-based framework to identify candidate cell-type-specific gene networks targeted by a set of variants from a genome-wide association study (GWAS). We applied our approach to predict interactions in 55 Roadmap Epigenomics Mapping Consortium cell types, which we used to interpret regulatory single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the NHGRI-EBI GWAS catalogue. Using our approach, we performed an in-depth characterization of fifteen different phenotypes including schizophrenia, coronary artery disease (CAD) and Crohn's disease. We found differentially wired subnetworks consisting of known as well as novel gene targets of regulatory SNPs.

A certain class of transcription factors, so-called pioneer transcription factors, can specifically recognize their binding sites on nucleosomal DNA, initiate local chromatin opening and facilitate the binding of co-factors in a cell-type-specific manner. For the vast majority of human pioneer transcription factors, the locations of their binding sites, mechanisms of binding and regulation remain unknown. We have developed a computational method to predict the cell-type-specific ability of transcription factors to bind nucleosomes by integrating ChIP-seq, MNaseq-seq and DNase-seq data with the details of nucleosome structure. We have achieved classification accuracy with AUC=0.94 in discriminating pioneer factors from canonical transcription factors and predicted 32 potential pioneer transcription factors as nucleosome binders in embryonic cell differentiation. Lastly, we systemically analyzed the interaction modes between various pioneer factors and detected several clusters of distinctive binding sites on nucleosomal DNA."

Yet, little is known about the effects of a diet containing high fat and alcohol towards epigenetic aging, with respect to changes in transcriptional and epigenomic profiles. In this study, we took up a multi-omics approach and integrated gene expression, methylation signals, and chromatin signals to study the epigenomic effects of a high-fat and alcohol-containing diet on mouse hepatocytes. We identified four relevant gene network clusters that were associated with relevant pathways that promote steatosis. Using a machine learning approach, we predict specific transcription factors that might be responsible to modulate the functionally relevant clusters. Finally, we discover four additional CpG loci and validate aging-related differential CpG methylation. Differential CpG methylation linked to aging showed minimal overlap with altered methylation in steatosis.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37410590","Cis-regulatory Landscape Size, Constraint, and Tissue Specificity Associate with Gene Function and Expression.","Genome Biol Evol","Multiple distal cis-regulatory elements (CREs) often cooperate to regulate gene expression, and the presence of multiple CREs for a gene has been proposed to provide redundancy and robustness to variation. However, we do not understand how attributes of a gene's distal CRE landscape-the CREs that contribute to its regulation-relate to its expression and function. Here, we integrate three-dimensional chromatin conformation and functional genomics data to quantify the CRE landscape composition genome-wide across ten human tissues and relate their attributes to the function, constraint, and expression patterns of genes. Within each tissue, we find that expressed genes have larger CRE landscapes than nonexpressed genes and that genes with tissue-specific CREs are more likely to have tissue-specific expression. Controlling for the association between expression level and CRE landscape size, we also find that CRE landscapes around genes under strong constraint (e.g., loss-of-function intolerant and housekeeping genes) are not significantly smaller than other expressed genes as previously proposed; however, they do have more evolutionarily conserved sequences than CREs of expressed genes overall. We also show that CRE landscape size does not associate with expression variability across individuals; nonetheless, genes with larger CRE landscapes have a relative depletion for variants that influence expression levels (expression quantitative trait loci). Overall, this work illustrates how differences in gene function, expression, and evolutionary constraint are reflected in features of CRE landscapes. Thus, considering the CRE landscape of a gene is vital for understanding gene expression dynamics across biological contexts and interpreting the effects of noncoding genetic variants.© The Author(s) 2023.

Despite the substantial increase in NDD studies employing whole-genome sequencing, there is no specific tool for prioritising the pathogenicity of CNVs in the context of NDDs.Using an XGBoost classifier, we integrated 189 features that represent genomic sequences, gene information and functional/genomic segments for evaluating genome-wide CNVs in a neuro/brain-specific manner, to develop a new tool, neuroCNVscore.

We addressed this through integrative next-generation sequencing of transcriptomes paired with five histone marks and DNA methylome profiling across 11 tissue types, deciphering the dog's epigenetic code by defining distinct chromatin states, super-enhancer, and methylome landscapes, and thus showed that these regions are associated with a wide range of biological functions and cell/tissue identity. In addition, we confirmed that the phenotype-associated variants are enriched in tissue-specific regulatory regions and, therefore, the tissue of origin of the variants can be traced.

Association signals cluster within gene-sets involved in skeletal development and osteoporosis.

Functional follow-up in zebrafish confirms the importance of ZIC1 on cranial suture patterning. Likewise, we observe abnormal cranial bone initiation that culminates in ectopic sutures and reduced BMD in mosaic atp6v1c1 knockouts.

Here, we will discuss the challenges in centromere transcription studies due to the repetitive nature and sequence similarity in centromeric and pericentric regions. Various technological breakthroughs have helped to tackle these challenges and reveal unique features of the centromeres and pericentromeres.

Interestingly, some newly analyzed repeat-based holocentromeres also resemble the architecture and the transcription behavior of monocentromeres. We will summarize evidences that support the functions of the transcription process and stalling, and those that support the functions of the centromeric and pericentric RNAs. The processing of centromeric and pericentric RNAs into multiple variants and their diverse structures may also provide clues to their functions. How future studies may address the separation of functions of specific centromeric transcription steps, processing pathways, and the transcripts themselves will also be discussed.© 2023.

To fully exploit the clinical potential of tissue-derived cfDNA, here we present one of thelargestcomprehensive and high-resolution methylation atlas based on 521 noncancer tissue samples spanning 29 major types of human tissues. We systematically identified fragment-level tissue-specific methylation patterns and extensively validated them in orthogonal datasets.

Fibroblast activation plays an essential role in cardiac fibrosis. Histone modifications are involved in various chromatin-dependent processes. Attenuation of the histone H3 trimethylation on lysine 27 demethylase UTX by RNA interference or heterozygous mutation extends lifespan in worm. The objective of this study was to explore whether epigenetic silencing of UTX mitigates aging-associated cardiac fibrosis.Middle-aged mice (15 months old) were used and started to receive adeno-associated virus-scrambled-small hairpin RNA and adeno-associated virus-UTX-small hairpin RNA every 3 months from 15 months to 21 months, respectively. The mice were euthanized at 24 months of age (length of the study).Adeno-associated virus-UTX-small hairpin RNA delivery significantly attenu-ated aging-associated increase in blood pressure, especially in diastolic blood pressure, indicating silencing of UTX rescued aging-associated cardiac dysfunction. Aging-associated cardiac fibrosis is characterized by fibroblast activation and abundant extracellular matrix deposition, including collagen deposition and alpha smooth muscle actin activation. Silencing of UTX abolished collagen deposition and alpha smooth muscle actin activation, decreased serum transforming growth factor β, blocked cardiac fibro blast s-to- myofi brobl asts trans-differentiation by elevation of cardiac resident mature fibroblast markers, TCF21, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha, which are important proteins for maintaining cardiac fibroblast physiological function. In the mechanistic study, adeno-associated virus-UTX-small hairpin RNA blocked transforming growth factor β-induced cardiac fibro blast s-to- myofi brobl asts trans-differentiation in isolated fibroblasts from 24-month-old mouse heart. The same results demonstrated as the in vivo study.Silencing of UTX attenuates aging-associated cardiac fibrosis via blocking cardiac fibroblasts-to-myofibroblasts transdifferentiation and consequently attenuates aging-associated cardiac dysfunction and cardiac fibrosis."

"37512019","Expression of CYP2B6 Enzyme in Human Liver Tissue of HIV and HCV Patients.","Medicina (Kaunas)","Background and Objectives: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections present significant public health challenges worldwide. The management of these infections is complicated by the need for antiviral and antiretroviral therapies, which are influenced by drug metabolism mediated by metabolic enzymes and transporters. This study focuses on the gene expression ofCYP2B6,CYP3A4, andABCB1transporters in patients with HIV, HCV, and HIV/HCV co-infection, aiming to assess their potential association with the choice of therapy, patohistological and clinical parameters of liver damage such as the stage of liver fibrosis, serum levels of ALT and AST, as well as the grade of liver inflammation and other available biochemical parameters.Materials and Methods: The study included 54 patients who underwent liver biopsy, divided into HIV-infected, HCV-infected, and co-infected groups. The mRNA levels ofCYP2B6,CYP3A4, andABCB1was quantified and compared between the groups, along with the analysis of liver fibrosis and inflammation levels.Results: The results indicated a significant increase inCYP2B6mRNA levels in co-infected patients, a significant association with the presence of HIV infection with an increase inCYP3A4mRNA levels. A trend towards downregulation ofABCB1expression was observed in patients using lamivudine.Conclusions: This study provides insight into gene expression ofCYP2B6 CYP3A4, andABCB1in HIV, HCV, and HIV/HCV co-infected patients. The absence of correlation with liver damage, inflammation, and specific treatment interventions emphasises the need for additional research to elucidate the complex interplay between gene expression, viral co-infection, liver pathology, and therapeutic responses in these particular patients population."
"37509625","DNA Methylation Signatures of Response to Conventional Synthetic and Biologic Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs (DMARDs) in Rheumatoid Arthritis.","Biomedicines","Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex condition that displays heterogeneity in disease severity and response to standard treatments between patients. Failure rates for conventional, target synthetic, and biologic disease-modifying rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are significant. Although there are models for predicting patient response, they have limited accuracy, require replication/validation, or for samples to be obtained through a synovial biopsy. Thus, currently, there are no prediction methods approved for routine clinical use. Previous research has shown that genetics and environmental factors alone cannot explain the differences in response between patients. Recent studies have demonstrated that deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation plays an important role in the pathogenesis and disease progression of RA. Importantly, specific DNA methylation profiles associated with response to conventional, target synthetic, and biologic DMARDs have been found in the blood of RA patients and could potentially function as predictive biomarkers. This review will summarize and evaluate the evidence for DNA methylation signatures in treatment response mainly in blood but also learn from the progress made in the diseased tissue in cancer in comparison to RA and autoimmune diseases. We will discuss the benefits and challenges of using DNA methylation signatures as predictive markers and the potential for future progress in this area."

The incidence of NOWS has increased in recent years due to the opioid epidemic. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules that play a crucial role in gene regulation. Epigenetic variations in microRNAs (miRNAs) and their impact on addiction-related processes is a rapidly evolving area of research.Methods:The Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip was used to analyze DNA methylation levels of miRNA-encoding genes in 96 human placental tissues to identify miRNA gene methylation profiles as-sociated with NOWS: 32 from mothers whose prenatally opioid-exposed infants required pharmacologic management for NOWS, 32 from mothers whose prenatally opioid-exposed infants did not require treat-ment for NOWS, and 32 unexposed controls.Results:The study identified 46 significantly differentially methylated (FDRp-value ≤ 0.05) CpGs associated with 47 unique miRNAs, with a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) ≥0.75 including 28 hypomethylated and 18 hypermethylated CpGs as potentially associated with NOWS. These dysregulated microRNA methylation patterns may be a contributing factor to NOWS pathogenesis.Conclusion:This is the first study to analyze miRNA methylation profiles in NOWS infants and illustrates the unique role miRNAs might have in diagnosing and treating the disease. Furthermore, these data may provide a step toward feasible precision medicine for NOWS babies as well.Copyright © 2023 Radhakrishna, Nath, Uppala, Veerappa, Forray, Muvvala, Metpally, Crist, Berrettini, Mausi, Vishweswaraiah and Bahado-Singh."

Smoking is one of the most common environmental factors causing epigenetic changes. The DNA methylation changes and mechanisms after quitting smoking have yet to be defined. The present study examined the changes in DNA methylation levels before and after short-term smoking cessation and explored the potential mechanism.Whole blood and clinical data were collected from 8 patients before and after short-term smoking cessation, DNA methylation was assessed, and differentially methylated sites were analyzed, followed by a comprehensive analysis of the differentially methylated sites with clinical data. GO/KEGG enrichment and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses identified the hub genes. The differentially methylated sites between former and current smokers in GSE50660 from the GEO database were detected by GEO2R. Then, a Venn analysis was carried out using the differentially methylated sites. GO/KEGG enrichment analysis was performed on the genes corresponding to the common DNA methylation sites, the PPI network was constructed, and hub genes were predicted. The enriched genes associated with the cell cycle were selected, and the pan-cancer gene expression and clinical significance in lung cancer were analyzed based on the TCGA database.Most genes showed decreased DNA methylation levels after short-term smoking cessation; 694 upregulated methylation CpG sites and 3184 downregulated methylation CpG sites were identified. The DNA methylation levels were altered according to the clinical data (body weight, expiratory, and tobacco dependence score). Enrichment analysis, construction of the PPI network, and pan-cancer analysis suggested that smoking cessation may affect various biological processes.Smoking cessation leads to epigenetic changes, mainly decreased in the decline of most DNA methylation levels. Bioinformatics further identified the biologically relevant changes after short-term smoking cessation.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37457732","Emerging roles of a chemoattractant receptor GPR15 and ligands in pathophysiology.","Front Immunol","Chemokine receptors play a central role in the maintenance of immune homeostasis and development of inflammation by directing leukocyte migration to tissues. GPR15 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that was initially known as a co-receptor for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), with structural similarity to other members of the chemoattractant receptor family. Since the discovery of its novel function as a colon-homing receptor of T cells in mice a decade ago, GPR15 has been rapidly gaining attention for its involvement in a variety of inflammatory and immune disorders. The recent identification of its natural ligand C10orf99, a chemokine-like polypeptide strongly expressed in gastrointestinal tissues, has established that GPR15-C10orf99 is a novel signaling axis that controls intestinal homeostasis and inflammation through the migration of immune cells. In addition, it has been demonstrated that C10orf99-independent functions of GPR15 and GPR15-independent activities of C10orf99 also play significant roles in the pathophysiology. Therefore, GPR15 and its ligands are potential therapeutic targets. To provide a basis for the future development of GPR15- or GPR15 ligand-targeted therapeutics, we have summarized the latest advances in the role of GPR15 and its ligands in human diseases as well as the molecular mechanisms that regulate GPR15 expression and functions.Copyright © 2023 Okamoto and Shikano."

We investigated peripheral whole-blood gene (co)expression to determine molecular changes prior to symptom onset.RNA was extracted and sequenced for 65 cognitively healthy F-PACK participants (65 (56-80) years, 34 APOE4 non-carriers, 31 APOE4 carriers), at baseline and follow-up (interval: 5.0 (3.4-8.6) years). Participants received amyloid PET at both time points and amyloid rate of change derived. Accumulators were defined with rate of change ≥ 2.19 Centiloids. We performed differential gene expression and weighted gene co-expression network analysis to identify differentially expressed genes and networks of co-expressed genes, respectively, with respect to traits of interest (APOE4 status, amyloid accumulation (binary/continuous)), and amyloid positivity status, followed by Gene Ontology annotation.There were 166 significant differentially expressed genes at follow-up compared to baseline in APOE4 carriers only, whereas 12 significant differentially expressed genes were found only in APOE4 non-carriers, over time. Among the significant genes in APOE4 carriers, several had strong evidence for a pathogenic role in AD based on direct association scores generated from the DISQOVER platform: NGRN, IGF2, GMPR, CLDN5, SMIM24. Top enrichment terms showed upregulated mitochondrial and metabolic pathways, and an exacerbated upregulation of ribosomal pathways in APOE4 carriers compared to non-carriers. Similarly, there were 33 unique significant differentially expressed genes at follow-up compared to baseline in individuals classified as amyloid negative at baseline and positive at follow-up or amyloid positive at both time points and 32 unique significant differentially expressed genes over time in individuals amyloid negative at both time points. Among the significant genes in the first group, the top five with the highest direct association scores were as follows: RPL17-C18orf32, HSP90AA1, MBP, SIRPB1, and GRINA. Top enrichment terms included upregulated metabolism and focal adhesion pathways. Baseline and follow-up gene co-expression networks were separately built. Seventeen baseline co-expression modules were derived, with one significantly negatively associated with amyloid accumulator status (r2 =  - 0.25, p = 0.046). This was enriched for proteasomal protein catabolic process and myeloid cell development. Thirty-two follow-up modules were derived, with two significantly associated with APOE4 status: one downregulated (r2 =  - 0.27, p = 0.035) and one upregulated (r2 = 0.26, p = 0.039) module. Top enrichment processes for the downregulated module included proteasomal protein catabolic process and myeloid cell homeostasis. Top enrichment processes for the upregulated module included cytoplasmic translation and rRNA processing.We show that there are longitudinal gene expression changes that implicate a disrupted immune system, protein removal, and metabolism in cognitively intact individuals who carry APOE4 or who accumulate in cortical amyloid. This provides insight into the pathophysiology of AD, whilst providing novel targets for drug and therapeutic development.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37398494","The MIND diet, brain transcriptomic alterations, and dementia.","medRxiv","Identifying novel mechanisms underlying dementia is critical to improving prevention and treatment. As an approach to mechanistic discovery, we investigated whether MIND diet (Mediterranean-DASH Diet Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay), a consistent risk factor for dementia, is correlated with a specific profile of cortical gene expression, and whether such a transcriptomic profile is associated with dementia, in the Religious Orders Study (ROS) and Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP). RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was conducted in postmortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissue from 1,204 deceased participants; neuropsychological assessments were performed annually prior to death. In a subset of 482 participants, diet was assessed ~6 years before death using a validated food-frequency questionnaire; in these participants, using elastic net regression, we identified a transcriptomic profile, consisting of 50 genes, significantly correlated with MIND diet score (P=0.001). In multivariable analysis of the remaining 722 individuals, higher transcriptomic score of MIND diet was associated with slower annual rate of decline in global cognition (β=0.011 per standard deviation increment in transcriptomic profile score,P=0.003) and lower odds of dementia (odds ratio [OR] =0.76,P=0.0002). Cortical expression of several genes appeared to mediate the association between MIND diet and dementia, includingTCIM, whose expression in inhibitory neurons and oligodendrocytes was associated with dementia in a subset of 424 individuals with single-nuclei RNA-seq data. In a secondary Mendelian randomization analysis, genetically predicted transcriptomic profile score was associated with dementia (OR=0.93,P=0.04). Our study suggests that associations between diet and cognitive health may involve brain molecular alterations at the transcriptomic level. Investigating brain molecular alterations related to diet may inform the identification of novel pathways underlying dementia."
"37482780","Early life impacts of maternal obesity: a window of opportunity to improve the health of two generations.","Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci","The number of pregnancies complicated by obesity is increasing in line with the worldwide obesity crisis; recent estimates suggest that in developed countries more than 50% of pregnancies are in women who are overweight or have obesity. Maternal obesity is associated with an increased risk of many adverse outcomes for both the mother and baby during pregnancy and birth. In addition to these immediate outcomes, maternal obesity before and during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of offspring cardio-metabolic disease later in life. Studies comparing siblings discordant forin uteroexposure to maternal obesity suggest this is not simply due to transmission of 'obesogenic genes' between mother and child or current lifestyle factors, but reflects a direct impact of the obese intrauterine environment on fetal development. This review will describe the long-term consequences of exposure to maternal obesity during development for the cardio-metabolic health of the offspring. It will also discuss the potential molecular mechanisms that underlie the increased risk of metabolic disease in offspring of mothers with obesity, and explore interventions that may be implemented during pregnancy to limit the impact of obesity on offspring long-term health.

We, therefore, aimed to investigate how much early age of weaning mediated the maternal-offspring adiposity relationship. The study included 4920 mother-child pairs from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children birth cohort. G-computation was applied to estimate the natural direct (NDE) and indirect (NIE) effects, via the age of weaning (<3 months, 3 months, >3 months), of maternal pre-pregnancy overweight or obesity on offspring's BMI and fat mass index. The NDE of maternal overweight or obesity on offspring BMI at 17 years old was 2.63 kg/m2(95% CI: 2.27 to 2.99). The NIE via the age of weaning was 0.02 kg/m2(95% CI: 0.00 to 0.04), corresponding to 0.8% of the total effect. Similar results were observed for the offspring's fat mass index. The NDE and NIE were similar to the main analyses when we looked at the relationship stratified by breastfeeding status. Our study found a minimal influence of age of weaning on the pathway between maternal and offspring adiposity, indicating the age of weaning may not be a key mediator."
"37343447","Dual roles of demethylation in cancer treatment and cardio-function recovery.","Redox Biol","There are no effective therapeutic targets or strategies that simultaneously inhibit tumour growth and promote cardiac function recovery. Here, we analyzed targets for cancer treatments and cardiac repair, with demethylation emerging as a common factor in these candidate lists. As DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) majorly responds to methylation, a natural compound library is screened, identifying dioscin as a novel agent targeted at DNMT1, widely used for heart diseases. Dioscin was found to reduce DNMT activities and inhibits growth in breast cancer cells. Combined with analyses of RNA-seq and MeDIP-seq, the promoters of antioxidant genes were demethylated after dioscin, recruiting NRF2 and elevating their expression. In Nrf2 knockout mice, the cardiac protection role of dioscin was blocked by Nrf2-loss. Furthermore, in tumour-bearing mice with hypertrophy, dioscin was observed to inhibit tumour growth and alleviate cardiac injury simultaneously. This study is the first to identify dioscin as a novel demethylation agent with dual functions of anti-cancer and cardio-protection.Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In the current study, shotgun metagenomic sequencing data of 12,415 fecal microbiomes from healthy individuals are employed for strain-level tracking of gut microbiota members to elucidate its evolving biodiversity across the human life span. This detailed longitudinal meta-analysis reveals host sex-related persistence of strains belonging to common, maternally-inherited species, such as Bifidobacterium bifidum and Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum. Comparative genome analyses, coupled with experiments including intimate interaction between microbes and human intestinal cells, show that specific bacterial glycosyl hydrolases related to host-glycan metabolism may contribute to more efficient colonization in females compared to males. These findings point to an intriguing ancient sex-specific host-microbe coevolution driving the selective persistence in women of key microbial taxa that may be vertically passed on to the next generation.© 2023.

However, the concentration of arsenic and other pesticide contaminants is greater in brown rice than in white. The potential health risks and benefits of consuming more brown rice than white rice remain unclear; thus, mainstream nutritional messaging should not advocate for brown rice over white rice. This mini-review aims to summarize the most salient concepts related to dietary arsenic exposure with emphasis on more recent findings and provide consumers with evidence of both risks and benefits of consuming more brown rice than white rice. Despite risk-benefit assessments being a challenging new frontier in nutrition, researchers should pursue an assessment to validate findings and solidify evidence. In the interim, consumers should be cognizant that the dose of arsenic exposure determines its toxicity, and brown rice contains a greater concentration of arsenic than white rice.Copyright © 2023 Su, Chiang and O’Connor."

The minor salivary glands, from which tissue samples may be obtained, are important for the diagnosis, evaluation of therapeutic efficacy, and genetic analyses of SS. In the onset of SS, autoantigens derived from the salivary glands are recognized by antigen-presenting dendritic cells, leading to the activation of T and B cells, cytokine production, autoantibody production by plasma cells, the formation of ectopic germinal centers, and the destruction of salivary gland epithelial cells. A recent therapeutic approach with immune checkpoint inhibitors for malignant tumors enhances the anti-tumor activity of cytotoxic effector T cells, but also induces SS-like autoimmune disease as an adverse event. In the treatment of xerostomia, muscarinic agonists and salivary gland duct cleansing procedure, as well as sialendoscopy, are expected to ameliorate symptoms. Clinical trials on biological therapy to attenuate the hyperresponsiveness of B cells in SS patients with systemic organ involvement have progressed. The efficacy of treatment with mesenchymal stem cells and chimeric antigen receptor T cells for SS has also been investigated. In this review, we will provide an overview of the pathogenesis of salivary gland lesions and recent trends in therapeutic approaches for SS."

However, the events involved in this EV-mediated Aβ pathology are unclear. EV-proteomics studies identified Serpine-1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, PAI-1) as a major connecting ""hub"" on several protein-protein interaction maps. Serpine-1 was described as a key player in Aβ pathology and was linked to HIV-1 infection as well. Therefore, the aim of this work was to address the hypothesis that Serpine-1 can be transferred via EVs from brain endothelial cells (HBMEC) to NPCs and contribute to NPC dysfunction. HBMEC concentrated and released Serpine-1 via EVs, the effect that was potentiated by HIV-1 and Aβ. EVs loaded with Serpine-1 were readily taken up by NPCs, and HIV-1 enhanced this event. Interestingly, a highly specific Serpine-1 inhibitor PAI039 increased EV-Aβ transfer to NPCs in the presence of HIV-1. PAI039 also partially blocked mitochondrial network morphology alterations in the recipient NPCs, which developed mainly after HIV + Aβ-EV transfer. PAI039 partly attenuated HIV-EV-mediated decreased synaptic protein levels in NPCs, while increased synaptic protein levels in NPC projections. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the complex mechanisms underlying EV-Serpine-1 related Aβ pathology in the context of HIV infection. They are relevant to HIV-1 associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) in an effort to elucidate the mechanisms of neuropathology in HIV infection.© 2023. The Author(s)."

The purpose of this review is to highlight recent studies integrating multi-omics data gathered from multiple molecular layers (i.e.; trans-omics) to reveal new molecular mechanisms that regulate bone biology and underpin skeletal diseases.Bone biologists have traditionally relied on single-omics technologies (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) to profile measureable differences (both qualitative and quantitative) of individual molecular layers for biological discovery and to investigate mechanisms of disease. Recently, literature has grown on the implementation of integrative multi-omics to study bone biology, which combines computational and informatics support to connect multiple layers of data derived from individual ""omic"" platforms. This emerging discipline termed ""trans-omics"" has enabled bone biologists to identify and construct detailed molecular networks, unveiling new pathways and unexpected interactions that have advanced our mechanistic understanding of bone biology and disease. While the era of trans-omics is poised to revolutionize our capacity to answer more complex and diverse questions pertinent to bone pathobiology, it also brings new challenges that are inherent when trying to connect ""Big Data"" sets.

Negative emotions during withdrawal are the primary factors affecting successful abstinence. Oxytocin is a critical modulator of emotions. OXTR, the oxytocin receptor, may also be a promising candidate for treating alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Previous studies indicated that people with different genotypes of OXTR rs2254298 were reported to suffer from more significant depressive or heightened anxiety symptoms when experiencing early adversity. The present study aims to explore the modulatory role of the polymorphism OXTR rs2254298 on mood disorders during alcohol withdrawal and to help researchers better understand and develop effective relapse prevention and interventions for alcohol use disorders.We recruited 265 adult Chinese Han men with AUD. Anxiety and depressive symptoms were measured using the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale and Self-Rating Depression Scale. Alcohol dependence levels were measured using Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test. Genomic DNA extraction and genotyping from participants' peripheral blood samples.First, a multiple linear regression was used to set the alcohol dependence level, OXTR.rs2254298, interaction terms as the primary predictor variable, and depression or anxiety as an outcome; age and educational years were covariates. There was a significant interaction between OXTR rs2254298 and alcohol dependence level on anxiety (B = 0.23, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.01-0.45) but not on depression (B = -0.06, 95% CI: -0.30 - 0.18). The significance region test showed that alcohol-dependent men who are GG homozygous were more likely to experience anxiety symptoms than subjects with the A allele (A allele:β = 0.27,p < 0.001; GG homozygote:β = 0.50,p < 0.001). Finally, re-parameterized regression analysis demonstrated that this gene-environment interaction of OXTR rs2254298 and alcohol dependence on anxiety fits the weak differential susceptibility model (R2 = 0.17,F(5,259) = 13.46,p < 0.001).This study reveals a gene-environment interactive effect between OXTR rs2254298 and alcohol withdrawal on anxiety but not depression. From the perspective of gene-environment interactions, this interaction fits the differential susceptibility model; OXTR rs2254298 GG homozygote carriers are susceptible to the environment and are likely to experience anxiety symptoms of alcohol withdrawal.Copyright © 2023 Shen, Yang, Wu, Chen, Hu, Zhou, Wang, Liu, Wu, Liu, Wang and Chen."

Research based on the construct of ACEs has transformed the field of adult mental health, yet child and adolescent mental health has often been overlooked in this work. This special issue of Research on Child and Adolescent Psychopathology focuses on the developmental science of ACEs and child psychopathology. The research presented here draws on the extensive evidence base that now exists regarding the co-occurrence of common childhood adversities, while informing the integration of theory and research on ACEs with that of developmental psychopathology at large. This Introduction provides an overview of ACEs and child mental health from a developmental psychopathology perspective, with an emphasis on key concepts and recent progress spanning the prenatal period through to adolescence and intergenerational pathways. Models of ACEs that emphasize the multi-dimensional nature of adversity and the importance of developmental timing to risk and protective pathways, have played a driving role in this progress.

"37507512","MAOA methylation is associated with impulsive and antisocial behaviour: dependence on allelic variation, family environment and diet.","J Neural Transm (Vienna)","Congenital absence of monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) activity predisposes to antisocial impulsive behaviour, and the MAOA uVNTR low-expressing genotype (MAOA-L) together with childhood maltreatment is associated with similar phenotypes in males. A possible explanation of how family environment may lead to such behaviour involves DNA methylation. We have assessed MAOA methylation and impulsive/antisocial behaviour in 121 males from the Estonian Children Personality Behaviour and Health Study. Of the 12 CpG sites measured, methylation levels at the locus designated CpG3 were significantly lower in subjects with antisocial behaviour involving police contact. CpG3 methylation was lower in subjects with alcohol use disorder by age 25, but only in MAOA-H genotype. No correlation between MAOA CpG3 methylation levels and adaptive impulsivity was found at age 15, but in MAOA-L genotype a positive correlation appeared by age 18. By age 25, this positive correlation was no longer observed in subjects with better family relationships but had increased further with experience of adversity within the family. MAOA CpG3 methylation had different developmental dynamics in relation to maladaptive impulsivity. At age 18, a positive correlation was observed in MAOA-L genotype with inferior family relationships and a negative correlation was found in MAOA-H with superior home environment; both of these associations had disappeared by age 25. CpG3 methylation was associated with dietary intake of several micronutrients, most notable was a negative correlation with the intake of zinc, but also with calcium, potassium and vitamin E; a positive correlation was found with intake of phosphorus. In conclusion, MAOA CpG3 methylation is related to both maladaptive and adaptive impulsivity in adolescence in MAOA-L males from adverse home environment. By young adulthood, this relationship with maladaptive impulsivity had disappeared but with adaptive impulsivity strengthened. Thus, MAOA CpG3 methylation may serve as a marker for adaptive developmental neuroplasticity in MAOA-L genotype. The mechanisms involved may include dietary factors.© 2023.

Osteoporosis, sarcopenia, osteosarcopenia, and frailty have also been linked with chronically increased levels of inflammatory factors. Due to the disruption of the kynurenine pathway by chronic inflammation and/or changes in the gut microbiota, serum levels of toxic metabolites are increased and are associated with the pathophysiology of those conditions. In contrast, anabolic products of this pathway, such as picolinic acid, have demonstrated a positive effect on skeletal muscle and bone. In addition, physical activity can modulate this pathway by promoting the secretion of anabolic kynurenines. According to the evidence collected, kynurenines could have a promising role as biomarkers for osteoporosis sarcopenia, osteosarcopenia, and frailty in older persons. In addition, some of these metabolites could become important targets for developing new pharmacological treatments for these conditions."
"37443352","Chromatin accessibility dynamics of neurogenic niche cells reveal defects in neural stem cell adhesion and migration during aging.","Nat Aging","The regenerative potential of brain stem cell niches deteriorates during aging. Yet the mechanisms underlying this decline are largely unknown. Here we characterize genome-wide chromatin accessibility of neurogenic niche cells in vivo during aging. Interestingly, chromatin accessibility at adhesion and migration genes decreases with age in quiescent neural stem cells (NSCs) but increases with age in activated (proliferative) NSCs. Quiescent and activated NSCs exhibit opposing adhesion behaviors during aging: quiescent NSCs become less adhesive, whereas activated NSCs become more adhesive. Old activated NSCs also show decreased migration in vitro and diminished mobilization out of the niche for neurogenesis in vivo. Using tension sensors, we find that aging increases force-producing adhesions in activated NSCs. Inhibiting the cytoskeletal-regulating kinase ROCK reduces these adhesions, restores migration in old activated NSCs in vitro, and boosts neurogenesis in vivo. These results have implications for restoring the migratory potential of NSCs and for improving neurogenesis in the aged brain.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Despite the considerable progress in the prevention and intervention, T2D and its complications cannot be reversed easily after diagnosis, thereby necessitating an in-depth investigation of the pathophysiology. In recent years, the role of epigenetics has been increasingly demonstrated in the disease, of which N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is one of the most common post-transcriptional modifications. Interestingly, patients with T2D show a low m6A abundance. Thus, a comprehensive analysis and understanding of this phenomenon would improve our understanding of the pathophysiology, as well as the search for new biomarkers and therapeutic approaches for T2D. In this review, we systematically introduced the metabolic roles of m6A modification in organs, the metabolic signaling pathways involved, and the effects of clinical drugs on T2D.Copyright © 2023 Zhang, Gu, Gang, Huang, Xiao and Ha."

We report here that DNMT1 function is regulated byO-GlcNAcylation, a protein modification that is sensitive to glucose levels, and that elevatedO-GlcNAcylation of DNMT1 from high glucose environment leads to alterations to the epigenome. Using mass spectrometry and complementary alanine mutation experiments, we identified S878 as the major residue that isO-GlcNAcylated on human DNMT1. Functional studies in human and mouse cells further revealed thatO-GlcNAcylation of DNMT1-S878 results in an inhibition of methyltransferase activity, resulting in a general loss of DNA methylation that preferentially occurs at partially methylated domains (PMDs). This loss of methylation corresponds with an increase in DNA damage and apoptosis. These results establishO-GlcNAcylation of DNMT1 as a mechanism through which the epigenome is regulated by glucose metabolism and implicates a role for glycosylation of DNMT1 in metabolic diseases characterized by hyperglycemia.© 2023, Shin et al."
"37441501","The circadian rhythm: an influential soundtrack in the diabetes story.","Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)","Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) has been the main category of metabolic diseases in recent years due to changes in lifestyle and environmental conditions such as diet and physical activity. On the other hand, the circadian rhythm is one of the most significant biological pathways in humans and other mammals, which is affected by light, sleep, and human activity. However, this cycle is controlled via complicated cellular pathways with feedback loops. It is widely known that changes in the circadian rhythm can alter some metabolic pathways of body cells and could affect the treatment process, particularly for metabolic diseases like T2DM. The aim of this study is to explore the importance of the circadian rhythm in the occurrence of T2DM via reviewing the metabolic pathways involved, their relationship with the circadian rhythm from two perspectives, lifestyle and molecular pathways, and their effect on T2DM pathophysiology. These impacts have been demonstrated in a variety of studies and led to the development of approaches such as time-restricted feeding, chronotherapy (time-specific therapies), and circadian molecule stabilizers.Copyright © 2023 Hariri, Mirian, Zarrabi, Kohandel, Amini-Pozveh, Aref, Tabatabaee, Prabhakar and Sivakumar."

However, the roles of m6A modification in liver lipid metabolism have yet to be understood entirely. We aimed to investigate the roles of the m6A ""writer"" protein methyltransferase-like 3 (Mettl3) in liver lipid metabolism and the underlying mechanisms.We assessed the expression of Mettl3 in liver tissues of diabetes (db/db) mice, obese (ob/ob) mice, high saturated fat-, cholesterol-, and fructose-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) mice, and alcohol abuse and alcoholism (NIAAA) mice by quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). Hepatocyte-specific Mettl3 knockout mice were used to evaluate the effects of Mettl3 deficiency in mouse liver. The molecular mechanisms underlying the roles of Mettl3 deletion in liver lipid metabolism were explored by multi-omics joint analysis of public data from the Gene Expression Omnibus database and further validated by qRT-PCR and Western blot.Significantly decreased Mettl3 expression was associated with NAFLD progression. Hepatocyte-specific knockout of Mettl3 resulted in significant lipid accumulation in the liver, increased serum total cholesterol levels, and progressive liver damage in mice. Mechanistically, loss of Mettl3 significantly downregulated the expression levels of multiple m6A-modified mRNAs related to lipid metabolism, including Adh7, Cpt1a, and Cyp7a1, further promoting lipid metabolism disorders and liver injury in mice.In summary, our findings demonstrate that the expression alteration of genes related to lipid metabolism by Mettl3-mediated m6A modification contributes to the development of NAFLD."

Overall, the individual GI microbiota composition appears to be rather stable but can be influenced by extreme shifts in environmental exposures. To date, there is no systematic literature review that examines the effects of extreme environmental conditions, such as strict isolation and confinement, on the GI microbiota.We conducted a systematic review to examine the effects of isolated and confined environments on the human GI microbiota. The literature search was conducted according to PRISMA criteria using PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane Library. Relevant studies were identified based on exposure to isolated and confined environments, generally being also antigen-limited, for a minimum of 28 days and classified according to the microbiota analysis method (cultivation- or molecular based approaches) and the isolation habitat (space, space- or microgravity simulation such as MARS-500 or natural isolation such as Antarctica). Microbial shifts in abundance, alpha diversity and community structure in response to isolation were assessed.Regardless of the study habitat, inconsistent shifts in abundance of 40 different genera, mainly in the phylum Bacillota (formerly Firmicutes) were reported. Overall, the heterogeneity of studies was high. Reducing heterogeneity was neither possible by differentiating the microbiota analysis methods nor by subgrouping according to the isolation habitat. Alpha diversity evolved non-specifically, whereas the microbial community structure remained dissimilar despite partial convergence. The GI ecosystem returned to baseline levels following exposure, showing resilience irrespective of the experiment length.An isolated and confined environment has a considerable impact on the GI microbiota composition in terms of diversity and relative abundances of dominant taxa. However, due to a limited number of studies with rather small sample sizes, it is important to approach an in-depth conclusion with caution, and results should be considered as a preliminary trend. The risk of dysbiosis and associated diseases should be considered when planning future projects in extreme environments.https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/, identifier CRD42022357589.Copyright © 2023 Klos, Steinbach, Ketel, Lambert, Penders, Doré, Enck and Mack."

We sought to characterize the molecular response involved by capturing changes in leukocyte transcriptomes from astronauts transitioning to and from long-duration spaceflight.Fourteen male and female astronauts with ~6-month- long missions aboard the International Space Station (ISS) had 10 blood samples collected throughout the three phases of the study: one pre-flight (PF), four in-flight (IF) while onboard the ISS, and five upon return to Earth (R). We measured gene expression through RNA sequencing of leukocytes and applied generalized linear modeling to assess differential expression across all 10 time points followed by the analysis of selected time points and functional enrichment of changing genes to identify shifts in biological processes.Our temporal analysis identified 276 differentially expressed transcripts grouped into two clusters (C) showing opposite profiles of expression with transitions to and from spaceflight: (C1) decrease-then-increase and (C2) increase-then-decrease. Both clusters converged toward average expression between ~2 and ~6 months in space. Further analysis of spaceflight transitions identified the decrease-then-increase pattern with most changes: 112 downregulated genes between PF and early spaceflight and 135 upregulated genes between late IF and R. Interestingly, 100 genes were both downregulated when reaching space and upregulated when landing on Earth. Functional enrichment at the transition to space related to immune suppression increased cell housekeeping functions and reduced cell proliferation. In contrast, egress to Earth is related to immune reactivation.The leukocytes' transcriptome changes describe rapid adaptations in response to entering space followed by opposite changes upon returning to Earth. These results shed light on immune modulation in space and highlight the major adaptive changes in cellular activity engaged to adapt to extreme environments.Copyright © 2023 Stratis, Trudel, Rocheleau, Pelchat and Laneuville."

Recent studies revealed that differentially methylated regions (DMRs) are implicated in regulating gene expression. The goal of this research was to determine which genes and pathways are dysregulated in breast cancer when their promoters are methylated in an abnormal way, leading to differential expression. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing was applied to analyze DMRs for eight peripheral blood samples collected from five Saudi females diagnosed with stages I and II of breast cancer aligned with three normal females. Three of those patients and three normal samples were used to determine differentially expressed genes (DEG) using Illumina platform NovaSeq PE150.Based on ontology (GO) and KEGG pathways, the analysis indicated that DMGs and DEG are closely related to associated processes, such as ubiquitin-protein transferase activity, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, and oxidative phosphorylation. The findings indicated a potentially significant association between global hypomethylation and breast cancer in Saudi patients. Our results revealed 81 differentially promoter-methylated and expressed genes. The most significant differentially methylated and expressed genes found in gene ontology (GO) are pumilio RNA binding family member 1 (PUM1) and zinc finger AN1-type containing 2B (ZFAND2B) also known as (AIRAPL).The essential outcomes of this study suggested that aberrant hypermethylation at crucial genes that have significant parts in the molecular pathways of breast cancer could be used as a potential prognostic biomarker for breast cancer.© 2023 Sindi et al."

During acute and chronic infections, the liver transforms from a tolerant to an active immune state. The defence mechanism of the liver mainly depends on a complicated network of intrahepatic and translocated immune cells and non-immune cells. Therefore, a comprehensive liver cell atlas in both healthy and diseased states is needed for new therapeutic target development and disease intervention improvement. With the development of high-throughput single-cell technology, we can now decipher heterogeneity, differentiation, and intercellular communication at the single-cell level in sophisticated organs and complicated diseases. In this concise review, we aimed to summarise the advancement of emerging high-throughput single-cell technologies and re-define our understanding of liver function towards infections, including hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, Plasmodium, schistosomiasis, endotoxemia, and corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We also unravel previously unknown pathogenic pathways and disease mechanisms for the development of new therapeutic targets. As high-throughput single-cell technologies mature, their integration into spatial transcriptomics, multiomics, and clinical data analysis will aid in patient stratification and in developing effective treatment plans for patients with or without liver injury due to infectious diseases.© 2023.

However, a systematic analysis of the exact role of INHBA in patients with gastric cancer (GC) has not yet been conducted. We evaluated the expression levels of INHBA and the correlation between INHBA and GC prognosis in GC. The relationship between INHBA expression, immune infiltration levels, and type markers of immune cells in GC was also explored. In addition, we studied INHBA mutations, promoter methylation, and functional enrichment analysis. Besides, high expression levels of INHBA in GC were significantly related to unfavorable prognosis. INHBA was negatively correlated with B cell infiltration, but positively correlated with macrophage and most anticancer immunity steps. INHBA expression was positively correlated with the type markers of CD8+ T cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells. INHBA has a weak significant methylation level change between tumor and normal tissues and mainly enriched in cancer-related signaling pathways. The present study implies that INHBA may serve as a potential biomarker for predicting the prognosis of patients with GC. INHBA is a promising predictor of immunotherapy response, with higher levels of INHBA indicating greater sensitivity.© 2023. The Author(s)."

To identify treatment options for BLCA, we systematically evaluated data from the Broad Institute DepMap project. We found that urothelial BLCA cell lines are among the most sensitive to microtubule assembly inhibition by paclitaxel treatment. Strikingly, we revealed that the top dependencies in BLCA cell lines include genes encoding proteins involved in microtubule assembly. This highlights the importance of microtubule network dynamics as a major vulnerability in human BLCA. In cancers such as ovarian and breast, where paclitaxel is the gold standard of care, resistance to paclitaxel treatment has been linked to p53-inactivating mutations. To study the response of BLCA to microtubule assembly inhibition and its mechanistic link with the mutational status of the p53 protein, we treated a collection of BLCA cell lines with a dose range of paclitaxel and performed a detailed characterization of the response. We discovered that BLCA cell lines are significantly sensitive to low concentrations of paclitaxel, independently of their p53 status. Paclitaxel induced a G2/M cell cycle arrest and growth inhibition, followed by robust activation of apoptosis. Most importantly, we revealed that paclitaxel triggered a robust DNA-damage response and apoptosis program without activating the p53 pathway. Integration of transcriptomics, epigenetic, and dependency data demonstrated that the response of BLCA to paclitaxel is independent of p53 mutational signatures but strongly depends on the expression of DNA repair genes. Our work highlights urothelial BLCA as an exceptional candidate for paclitaxel treatment. It paves the way for the rational use of a combination of paclitaxel and DNA repair inhibitors as an effective, novel therapeutic strategy."

Thus, we aimed to refine molecular subtypes and to uncover therapeutic targets. We classified the subtypes based on gene expression (n= 81) and validated them in our samples (n= 87). Non-SCLC samples were compared with SCLC subtypes to identify the early development stage of SCLC. Single-cell transcriptome analysis was applied to dissect the TME of bulk samples. Finally, to overcome platinum resistance, we performed drug screening of patient-derived cells and cell lines. Four subtypes were identified: the ASCL1+ (SCLC-A) subtype identified asTP53/RB-mutated non-SCLC representing the early development stage of SCLC; the immune activation (SCLC-I) subtype, showing high CD8+/PD-L1+ T-cell infiltration and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT); the NEUROD1 (SCLC-N) subtype, which showed neurotransmission process; and the POU2F3+ (SCLC-P) subtype with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). EndMT was associated with the worst prognosis. While SCLC-A/N exhibited platinum sensitivity, the EndMT signal of SCLC-I conferred platinum resistance. A BET inhibitor suppressed the aggressive angiogenesis phenotype of SCLC-I. We revealed that EndMT development contributed to a poor outcome in SCLC-I. Moreover, heterogenous TME development facilitated platinum resistance. BET inhibitors are novel candidates for overcoming platinum resistance."

Not only the tumor itself but also adverse effects of chemotherapy have been reported to contribute to increased GDF15. Although regulation of GDF15 transcription by BET domain has recently been reported, the molecular mechanisms of GDF15 gene regulation by drugs are still unknown, leaving uncertainty about the safe and effective therapeutic strategies targeting GDF15. We screened various cardiotoxic drugs and BET inhibitors for their effects on GDF15 regulation in human cardiomyocytes and cancer cell lines and analyzed in-house and public gene signature databases. We found that DNA damaging drugs induce GDF15 in cardiomyocytes more strongly than drugs with other modes of action. In cancer cells, GDF15 induction varied depending on drug- and cell type-specific gene signatures including mutations in PI3KCA, TP53, BRAF and MUC16. GDF15 suppression by BET inhibition is particularly effective in cancer cells with low activity of the PI3K/Akt axis and high extracellular concentrations of pantothenate. Our findings provide insights that the risk for GDF15 overexpression and concomitant cachexia can be reduced by a personalized selection of anticancer drugs and patients for precision medicine.© 2023.

"37495688","Rewiring cancer drivers to activate apoptosis.","Nature","Genes that drive the proliferation, survival, invasion and metastasis of malignant cells have been identified for many human cancers1-4. Independent studies have identified cell death pathways that eliminate cells for the good of the organism5,6. The coexistence of cell death pathways with driver mutations suggests that the cancer driver could be rewired to activate cell death using chemical inducers of proximity (CIPs). Here we describe a new class of molecules called transcriptional/epigenetic CIPs (TCIPs) that recruit the endogenous cancer driver, or a downstream transcription factor, to the promoters of cell death genes, thereby activating their expression. We focused on diffuse large B cell lymphoma, in which the transcription factor B cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) is deregulated7. BCL6 binds to the promoters of cell death genes and epigenetically suppresses their expression8. We produced TCIPs by covalently linking small molecules that bind BCL6 to those that bind to transcriptional activators that contribute to the oncogenic program, such as BRD4. The most potent molecule, TCIP1, increases binding of BRD4 by 50% over genomic BCL6-binding sites to produce transcriptional elongation at pro-apoptotic target genes within 15 min, while reducing binding of BRD4 over enhancers by only 10%, reflecting a gain-of-function mechanism. TCIP1 kills diffuse large B cell lymphoma cell lines, including chemotherapy-resistant, TP53-mutant lines, at EC50of 1-10 nM in 72 h and exhibits cell-specific and tissue-specific effects, capturing the combinatorial specificity inherent to transcription. The TCIP concept also has therapeutic applications in regulating the expression of genes for regenerative medicine and developmental disorders.© 2023.

To elucidate this relationship in treatment-naive animals, we hereby describe mammary-specific transposon-mutagenesis screens in female mice together with loss-of-function Rb, which is frequently inactivated in breast-cancer. We report gene-centric common insertion-sites (gCIS) that are enriched in primary-tumors, in metastases or shared by both compartments. Shared-gCIS comprise a major MET-RAS network, whereas metastasis-gCIS form three additional hubs: Rho-signaling, Ubiquitination and RNA-processing. Pathway analysis of four clinical cohorts with paired primary-tumors and metastases reveals similar organization in human breast-cancer with subtype-specific shared-drivers (e.g. RB1-loss, TP53-loss, high MET, RAS, ER), primary-enriched (EGFR, TGFβ and STAT3) and metastasis-enriched (RHO, PI3K) oncogenic signaling. Inhibitors of RB1-deficiency or MET plus RHO-signaling cooperate to block cell migration and drive tumor cell-death. Thus, targeting shared- and metastasis- but not primary-enriched derivers offers a rational avenue to prevent metastatic breast-cancer.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Previously, we introduced the concept of genetic Minimal Cut Sets (gMCSs), a theoretical approach to SL developed for genome-scale metabolic networks. The major challenge in our gMCS framework is to go beyond metabolic networks and extend existing algorithms to more complex protein-protein interactions. In this article, we take a step further and incorporate linear regulatory pathways into our gMCS approach. Extensive algorithmic modifications to compute gMCSs in integrated metabolic and regulatory models are presented in detail. Our extended approach is applied to calculate gMCSs in integrated models of human cells. In particular, we integrate the most recent genome-scale metabolic network, Human1, with 3 different regulatory network databases: Omnipath, Dorothea and TRRUST. Based on the computed gMCSs and transcriptomic data, we discovered new essential genes and their associated synthetic lethal for different cancer cell lines. The performance of the different integrated models is assessed with available large-scale in-vitro gene silencing data.

We analyzed the genomic alterations of USP28 in various cancers using the cBioPortal dataset. Besides, gene set enrichment analysis was used to analyze the associated cancer hallmarks with USP28 expression, and TIMER2.0 was taken to investigate the immune cell infiltrations related to the USP28 level.USP28 is highly expressed in most tumors and has prognostic value across various cancer types. Moreover, a significant correlation exists between USP28 and immune regulators, clinical staging, checkpoint inhibitor response, MSI, TMB, CNV, MMR defects, and DNA methylation. Additionally, USP28 expression is strongly associated with the infiltration levels of neutrophils and NK cells in most tumor types. One of the most significant findings of our study was that USP28 could serve as a significant predictor of anti-CTLA4 therapy response in melanoma patients. Additionally, our molecular biology experiments validated that the knockdown of USP28 substantially reduced the proliferative and invasive abilities of the HCC cell lines.Our study suggests that USP28 could potentially serve as a biomarker for cancer immunologic infiltration and poor prognosis, with potential applications in developing novel cancer treatment strategies."

From the results of this meta-analysis, we established a panel of lncRNAs that are highly correlated with EOC. The panel includes several lncRNAs that are already known and even functionally characterized in EOC, but also lncRNAs that have not been previously correlated with this cancer, and which are discussed in relation to their putative role in EOC and their potential use as clinically relevant tools."
"37445737","Expression-Based Diagnosis, Treatment Selection, and Drug Development for Breast Cancer.","Int J Mol Sci","There is currently no gene expression assay that can assess if premalignant lesions will develop into invasive breast cancer. This study sought to identify biomarkers for selecting patients with a high potential for developing invasive carcinoma in the breast with normal histology, benign lesions, or premalignant lesions. A set of 26-gene mRNA expression profiles were used to identify invasive ductal carcinomas from histologically normal tissue and benign lesions and to select those with a higher potential for future cancer development (ADHC) in the breast associated with atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH). The expression-defined model achieved an overall accuracy of 94.05% (AUC = 0.96) in classifying invasive ductal carcinomas from histologically normal tissue and benign lesions (n= 185). This gene signature classified cancer development in ADH tissues with an overall accuracy of 100% (n= 8). The mRNA expression patterns of these 26 genes were validated using RT-PCR analyses of independent tissue samples (n= 77) and blood samples (n= 48). The protein expression of PBX2 and RAD52 assessed with immunohistochemistry were prognostic of breast cancer survival outcomes. This signature provided significant prognostic stratification in The Cancer Genome Atlas breast cancer patients (n= 1100), as well as basal-like and luminal A subtypes, and was associated with distinct immune infiltration and activities. The mRNA and protein expression of the 26 genes was associated with sensitivity or resistance to 18 NCCN-recommended drugs for treating breast cancer. Eleven genes had significant proliferative potential in CRISPR-Cas9/RNAi screening. Based on this gene expression signature, the VEGFR inhibitor ZM-306416 was discovered as a new drug for treating breast cancer."

Ferroptosis is a nonapoptotic cell death triggered by iron-mediated lipid peroxidation. We found that TFRC, an iron uptake protein, was expressed at higher levels in sarcoma cell lines than in noncancer and carcinoma cell lines. Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) protects cells against ferroptosis, and its inhibition using RAS-selective lethal 3 (RSL3) had an antitumor effect that was more pronounced in sarcoma cell lines, particularly synovial sarcoma cells, compared to non-sarcoma cells. Because NF-κB can provoke ferroptosis, we examined the role of SHARPIN, an activator of NF-κB, in sarcoma. We found that SHARPIN expression was significantly associated with reduced survival in cohorts of patients with cancer, including sarcoma. In addition, SHARPIN promoted the sensitivity of sarcoma cells to ferroptosis. Further analyses revealed that the PGC1α/NRF2/SLC7A11 axis and BNIP3L/NIX-mediated mitophagy are regulated through NF-κB and PRMT5 downstream of SHARPIN. Our findings suggest that ferroptosis could have a therapeutic effect in sarcoma, particularly in subpopulations with high TFRC and SHARPIN expression."

Immunotherapy has greatly improved the prognosis of advanced BRCA. Cellular senescence contributes to tumorigenesis and suppresses anti-cancer immunity. Identification of senescence-relevant long noncoding RNAs (SRlncRNAs) signature may benefit the predictions of prognosis and response to immunotherapy of BRCA. RNA-seq, mutation, and clinical data of BRCA were acquired from public databases. SRlncRNAs were screened using univariate Cox regression analysis. Consensus clustering classified BRCA patients into 2 clusters, and the differences of overall survival (OS) and immune status between the 2 clusters were analyzed by survival analysis, CIBERSORT, and ESITIMATE. The SRlncRNAs signature was constructed by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis, and BRCA patients were divided into 2 risk groups. Enrichment analyses were performed to explore the cancer- and immunotherapy-relevant pathways. Transcriptome analysis was performed to investigate the differences of OS, immune infiltration, and ESITIMATE score of the 2 groups. Genome analysis was applied to investigate the differences of somatic mutation, tumor mutation burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI) between the 2 risk groups. A nomogram combined with calibration curves and decision curve analysis (DCA) was established for better clinical decision. Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) score and IMvigor-210 were applied for the predicting of response to immunotherapy. Profiling Relative Inhibition Simultaneously in Mixtures (PRISM) and the Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal resource (CTRP) databases were used for drug susceptibility analysis. Ten prognostic SRlncRNAs were identified and BRCA patients were divided into 2 clusters. Cluster 1 had better OS with anti-tumor immune microenvironment. The high-risk BRCA had poorer OS in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) training cohort, which was also verified by TCGA validation cohort and GSE20685 validation cohort. Low-risk patients also had anti-tumor immune microenvironment. Genome analysis demonstrated that the high-risk group had significant higher TMB. High-risk BRCA were more susceptive to immunotherapy according to the TIDE score and IMvigor-210. Finally, drug susceptibility analysis showed that 6 compounds were sensitive to high-risk BRCA patients. We developed and verified an original SRlncRNAs signature by multi-omics analysis, which could serve as a prognosis and immunotherapy predictor for BRCA.Copyright © 2023 the Author(s).

At an early-stage of the metastatic disease, miR-662 could mask the presence of BC metastases in bone by inhibiting the differentiation of bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Nonetheless, metastatic miR-662-overexpressing BC cells then progressed as overt osteolytic metastases thanks to increased stem cell-like traits.MiR-662 is involved in BC metastasis progression, suggesting it may be used as a prognostic marker to identify BC patients at high risk of metastasis.© 2023.

CRISPR-Cas9 technology can be utilized to identify therapeutic targets for novel therapeutic approaches. In this study, our goal was to identify key genes related to the survival of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells by analyzing the DepMap database based on CRISPR-Cas9. We screened candidate genes associated with HCC cell survival and proliferation from DepMap and identified their expression levels in HCC from the TCGA database. To develop a prognostic risk model based on these candidate genes, we performed WGCNA, functional pathway enrichment analysis, protein interaction network construction, and LASSO analysis. Our findings show that 692 genes were critical for HCC cell proliferation and survival, and among them, 571 DEGs were identified in HCC tissues. WGCNA categorized these 584 genes into three modules, and the blue module consisting of 135 genes was positively linked to the tumor stage. Using the MCODE approach in Cytoscape, we identified ten hub genes in the PPI network, and through Cox univariate analysis and Lasso analysis, we developed a prognostic model consisting of three genes (SFPQ, SSRP1, and KPNB1). Furthermore, knocking down SFPQ inhibited HCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In conclusion, we identified three core genes (SFPQ, SSRP1, and KPNB1) that are essential for the proliferation and survival of HCC cells. These genes were used to develop a prognostic risk model, and knockdown of SFPQ was found to inhibit the proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells.AJCR Copyright © 2023."

Next, the expression of serum exosomal miR-4256 was analyzed in GC cells and GC tissues, and the role of miR-4256 in GC was investigated byin vitroandin vivoexperiments. Then, the effect of miR-4256 on its downstream target genes HDAC5/p16INK4awas studied in GC cells, and the underlying mechanisms were evaluated using dual luciferase reporter assay and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Additionally, the role of the miR-4256/HDAC5/p16INK4aaxis in GC was studied usingin vitroandin vivoexperiments. Finally, the upstream regulators SMAD2/p300 that regulate miR-4256 expression and their role in GC were explored usingin vitroexperiments. miR-4256 was the most significantly upregulated miRNA and was overexpressed in GC cell lines and GC tissues;in vitroandin vivoresults showed that miR-4256 promoted GC growth and progression. Mechanistically, miR-4256 enhanced HDAC5 expression by targeting the promoter of the HDAC5 gene in GC cells, and then restrained the expression of p16INK4athrough the epigenetic modulation of HDAC5 at the p16INK4apromoter. Furthermore, miR-4256 overexpression was positively regulated by the SMAD2/p300 complex in GC cells. Our data indicate that miR-4256 functions as an oncogene in GC via the SMAD2/miR-4256/HDAC5/p16INK4aaxis, which participates in GC progression and provides novel therapeutic and prognostic biomarkers for GC.© 2023 Wang et al."

This study aims to describe metabolic landscape of PDAC. Bioinformatics analysis was used to investigate the differences of genome, transcriptome, and proteome levels of metabolic patterns. Three subtypes (MC1, MC2, and MC3) were identified and characterized as distinct metabolic patterns. MC1, enriched in lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism signatures, was associated with lower abundance of immune cells and stromal cells, and non-response to immunotherapy. MC2 displayed immune-activated characteristics, minor genome alterations and good response to immunotherapy. MC3 was characterized by high glucose metabolism, high pathological grade, immune-suppressed features, poor prognosis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition phenotype. A ninety-three gene classifier preformed robust prediction and high accuracy (training set: 93.7%; validation set 1: 85.0%; validation set 2: 83.9%). Using random forest classifier, probabilities of three patterns could be predicted on pancreatic cancer cell lines, which could be used to find vulnerable targets in response to both genetic and drug perturbation. Our study revealed features of PDAC metabolic landscape, which could be expected to provide a reference for prognosis prediction and precise treatment design.© 2023.

"37414849","Dynamic de novo heterochromatin assembly and disassembly at replication forks ensures fork stability.","Nat Cell Biol","Chromatin is dynamically reorganized when DNA replication forks are challenged. However, the process of epigenetic reorganization and its implication for fork stability is poorly understood. Here we discover a checkpoint-regulated cascade of chromatin signalling that activates the histone methyltransferase EHMT2/G9a to catalyse heterochromatin assembly at stressed replication forks. Using biochemical and single molecule chromatin fibre approaches, we show that G9a together with SUV39h1 induces chromatin compaction by accumulating the repressive modifications, H3K9me1/me2/me3, in the vicinity of stressed replication forks. This closed conformation is also favoured by the G9a-dependent exclusion of the H3K9-demethylase JMJD1A/KDM3A, which facilitates heterochromatin disassembly upon fork restart. Untimely heterochromatin disassembly from stressed forks by KDM3A enables PRIMPOL access, triggering single-stranded DNA gap formation and sensitizing cells towards chemotherapeutic drugs. These findings may help in explaining chemotherapy resistance and poor prognosis observed in patients with cancer displaying elevated levels of G9a/H3K9me3.© 2023. The Author(s)."

It is commonly understood that many commercial antibodies do not recognize their intended targets, but information on the scope of the problem remains largely anecdotal, and as such, feasibility of the goal of at least one potent and specific antibody targeting each protein in a proteome cannot be assessed. Focusing on antibodies for human proteins, we have scaled a standardized characterization approach using parental and knockout cell lines to assess the performance of 614 commercial antibodies for 65 neuroscience-related proteins. Side-by-side comparisons of all antibodies against each target, obtained from multiple commercial partners, demonstrates that: i) more than 50% of all antibodies failed in one or more tests, ii) yet, ~50-75% of the protein set was covered by at least one high-performing antibody, depending on application, suggesting that coverage of human proteins by commercial antibodies is significant; and iii) recombinant antibodies performed better than monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies. The hundreds of underperforming antibodies identified in this study were found to have been used in a large number of published articles, which should raise alarm. Encouragingly, more than half of the underperforming commercial antibodies were reassessed by the manufacturers, and many had alterations to their recommended usage or were removed from the market. This first such study helps demonstrate the scale of the antibody specificity problem but also suggests an efficient strategy toward achieving coverage of the human proteome; mine the existing commercial antibody repertoire, and use the data to focus new renewable antibody generation efforts."

Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I RNA) editing is an epigenetic process involved in neurological disorders, yet its role in myopia remains undetermined. We performed a transcriptome-wide analysis of A-to-I RNA editing in the retina of form-deprivation myopia mice. Our study identified 91 A-to-I RNA editing sites in 84 genes associated with myopia. Notably, at least 27 (32.1%) of these genes with myopia-associated RNA editing showed existing evidence to be associated with myopia or related ocular phenotypes in humans or animal models, such as very low-density lipoprotein receptor (Vldlr) in retinal neovascularization and hypoxia-induced factor 1 alpha (Hif1a). Moreover, functional enrichment showed that RNA editing enriched in FDM was primarily involved in response to fungicides, a potentially druggable process for myopia prevention, and epigenetic regulation. In contrast, RNA editing enriched in controls was mostly involved in post-embryonic eye morphogenesis. Our results demonstrate altered A-to-I RNA editing associated with myopia in an experimental mouse model and warrant further study on its role in myopia development.Copyright © 2023 Pan, He, Lu, Pan, Wei, Jin, Wang and Chen."

Gβγ signaling is negatively regulated by a Cullin3 (Cul3)-dependent E3 ligase, KCTD5, which triggers ubiquitination and degradation of free Gβγ. Here, we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of the KCTD5-Gβγ fusion complex and the KCTD7-Cul3 complex. KCTD5 in pentameric form engages symmetrically with five copies of Gβγ through its C-terminal domain. The unique pentameric assembly of the KCTD5/Cul3 E3 ligase places the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) and the modification sites of Gβγ in close proximity and allows simultaneous transfer of ubiquitin from E2 to five Gβγ subunits. Moreover, we show that ubiquitination of Gβγ by KCTD5 is important for fine-tuning cyclic adenosine 3´,5´-monophosphate signaling of GPCRs. Our studies provide unprecedented insights into mechanisms of substrate recognition by unusual pentameric E3 ligases and highlight the KCTD family as emerging regulators of GPCR signaling."

However, relatively little is known about their tumourigenic drivers, other than mutations involving the multiple endocrine neoplasia 1 (MEN1), ATRX chromatin remodeler, and death domain-associated protein genes, which are found in ~40% of sporadic PNETs. PNETs have a low mutational burden, thereby suggesting that other factors likely contribute to their development, including epigenetic regulators. One such epigenetic process, DNA methylation, silences gene transcriptionvia5'methylcytosine (5mC), and this is usually facilitated by DNA methyltransferase enzymes at CpG-rich areas around gene promoters. However, 5'hydroxymethylcytosine, which is the first epigenetic mark during cytosine demethylation, and opposes the function of 5mC, is associated with gene transcription, although the significance of this remains unknown, as it is indistinguishable from 5mC when conventional bisulfite conversion techniques are solely used. Advances in array-based technologies have facilitated the investigation of PNET methylomes and enabled PNETs to be clustered by methylome signatures, which has assisted in prognosis and discovery of new aberrantly regulated genes contributing to tumourigenesis. This review will discuss the biology of DNA methylation, its role in PNET development, and impact on prognostication and discovery of epigenome-targeted therapies.© the author(s)."

They rarely present in healthy adults' circulatory systems but can be found circulating in fetuses and neonates. An NRBC count is a cost-effective laboratory test that is currently rarely used in everyday clinical practice; it is mostly used in the diagnosis of hematological diseases/disorders relating to erythropoiesis, anemia, or hemolysis. However, according to several studies, it may be used as a biomarker in the diagnosis and clinical outcome prognosis of preterm infants or severely ill adult patients. This would allow for a quick diagnosis of life-threatening conditions and the prediction of a possible change in a patient's condition, especially in relation to patients in the intensive care unit. In this review, we sought to summarize the possible use of NRBCs as a prognostic marker in various disease entities. Research into the evaluation of the NRBCs in the pediatric population most often concerns neonatal hypoxia, the occurrence and consequences of asphyxia, and overall neonatal mortality. Among adults, NRBCs can be used to predict changes in clinical condition and mortality in critically ill patients, including those with sepsis, trauma, ARDS, acute pancreatitis, or severe cardiovascular disease."

These cells adopt distinct transcriptional subtypes known as states. Understanding state function, especially in human microglia, has been elusive owing to a lack of tools to model and manipulate these cells. Here, we developed a platform for modeling human microglia transcriptional states in vitro. We found that exposure of human stem-cell-differentiated microglia to synaptosomes, myelin debris, apoptotic neurons or synthetic amyloid-beta fibrils generated transcriptional diversity that mapped to gene signatures identified in human brain microglia, including disease-associated microglia, a state enriched in neurodegenerative diseases. Using a new lentiviral approach, we demonstrated that the transcription factor MITF drives a disease-associated transcriptional signature and a highly phagocytic state. Together, these tools enable the manipulation and functional interrogation of human microglial states in both homeostatic and disease-relevant contexts.© 2023. The Author(s)."

We observe that the transcriptomic profiles of sensory neuron subtypes are broadly similar across vertebrates, but the expression of functionally important neuropeptides and channels can vary notably.

Multivariate Cox regression showed overexpression of POLA2 effectively distinguished the prognosis at different T, N, M, stages and grades of HCC. POLA2 expression correlated with mutation burden, immune cells infiltration and immune-associated genes expression of HCC. Functional enrichment revealed that POLA2 co-expressed genes were linked to cellular activity, plasma membrane protein complex and leukocyte activity, immune response-regulated cell surface receptor signaling pathway, and immune response-regulated signaling pathway. Moreover, POLA2 was also positively co-expressed with some immune checkpoints (CD274, CTL-4, HAVCR2, PDCD1, PDCD1LG2, TIGIT, and LAG3) (p < 0.001). Gene knockdown revealed that POLA2 promoted proliferation, migration, invasion, and cell cycle of SMMC-7721 and HepG2. The HCC xenograft tumor model also demonstrated remarkably tumor size inhibition, tumor proliferation inhibtion and tumor necrosis promotion when POLA2 knockdown.POLA2 influenced immune microenvironment and tumor progression of HCC indicated that it might be a potential molecular marker for prognostic evaluation or a therapeutic target for HCC.© 2023.

"37520658","Endocannabinoid signaling and epigenetics modifications in the neurobiology of stress-related disorders.","Neuronal Signal","Stress exposure is associated with psychiatric conditions, such as depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is also a vulnerability factor to developing or reinstating substance use disorder. Stress causes several changes in the neuro-immune-endocrine axis, potentially resulting in prolonged dysfunction and diseases. Changes in several transmitters, including serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glucocorticoids, and cytokines, are associated with psychiatric disorders or behavioral alterations in preclinical studies. Complex and interacting mechanisms make it very difficult to understand the physiopathology of psychiatry conditions; therefore, studying regulatory mechanisms that impact these alterations is a good approach. In the last decades, the impact of stress on biology through epigenetic markers, which directly impact gene expression, is under intense investigation; these mechanisms are associated with behavioral alterations in animal models after stress or drug exposure, for example. The endocannabinoid (eCB) system modulates stress response, reward circuits, and other physiological functions, including hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis activation and immune response. eCBs, for example, act retrogradely at presynaptic neurons, limiting the release of neurotransmitters, a mechanism implicated in the antidepressant and anxiolytic effects after stress. Epigenetic mechanisms can impact the expression of eCB system molecules, which in turn can regulate epigenetic mechanisms. This review will present evidence of how the eCB system and epigenetic mechanisms interact and the consequences of this interaction in modulating behavioral changes after stress exposure in preclinical studies or psychiatric conditions. Moreover, evidence that correlates the involvement of the eCB system and epigenetic mechanisms in drug abuse contexts will be discussed.© 2023 The Author(s)."

The cellular heterogeneity of the human brain6,7and the complex regulation of gene expression highlight the need to characterize human-specific molecular features at cellular resolution. Here we analysed single-nucleus RNA-sequencing and single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing datasets for human, chimpanzee and rhesus macaque brain tissue from posterior cingulate cortex. We show a human-specific increase of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and a decrease of mature oligodendrocytes across cortical tissues. Human-specific regulatory changes were accelerated in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, and we highlight key biological pathways that may be associated with the proportional changes. We also identify human-specific regulatory changes in neuronal subtypes, which reveal human-specific upregulation of FOXP2 in only two of the neuronal subtypes. We additionally identify hundreds of new human accelerated genomic regions associated with human-specific chromatin accessibility changes. Our data also reveal that FOS::JUN and FOX motifs are enriched in the human-specifically accessible chromatin regions of excitatory neuronal subtypes. Together, our results reveal several new mechanisms underlying the evolutionary innovation of human brain at cell-type resolution.© 2023.

"37444448","Prognostic Values of Systemic Inflammatory Immunological Markers in Glioblastoma: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.","Cancers (Basel)","Neutrophils are an important part of the tumor microenvironment, which stimulates inflammatory processes through phagocytosis, degranulation, release of small DNA fragments (cell-free DNA), and presentation of antigens. Since neutrophils accumulate in peripheral blood in patients with advanced-stage cancer, a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio can be a biomarker of a poor prognosis in patients with glioblastoma. The present study aimed to explore the prognostic value of the preoperative levels of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), systemic immune inflammation index (SII), systemic inflammation response index (SIRI), and cell-free DNA (cfDNA) to better predict prognostic implications in the survival rate of glioblastoma patients.The meta-analysis was carried out according to the recommendations and standards established by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Databases of PubMed, EBSCO, and Medline were systematically searched to select all the relevant studies published up to December 2022.Poorer prognoses were recorded in patients with a high NLR or PLR when compared with the patients with a low NLR or PLR (HR 1.51, 95% CI 1.24-1.83,p< 0.0001 and HR 1.34, 95% CI 1.10-1.63,p< 0.01, respectively). Similarly, a worse prognosis was reported for patients with a higher cfDNA (HR 2.35, 95% CI 1.27-4.36,p< 0.01). The SII and SIRI values were not related to glioblastoma survival (p= 0.0533 andp= 0.482, respectively).Thus, NLR, PLR, and cfDNA, unlike SII and SIRI, appeared to be useful and convenient peripheral inflammatory markers to assess the prognosis in glioblastoma."

Large-scale proteomic profiling technology is not mature at single-cell resolution to examine the protein activities in disease-relevant cell types. We proposeiProMix, a novel statistical framework to identify epithelial-cell specific associations between ACE2 and other proteins/pathways with bulk proteomic data.iProMixdecomposes the data and models cell-type-specific conditional joint distribution of proteins through a mixture model. It improves cell-type composition estimation from prior input, and utilizes a non-parametric inference framework to account for uncertainty of cell-type proportion estimates in hypothesis test. Simulations demonstrateiProMixhas well-controlled false discovery rates and favorable powers in non-asymptotic settings. We applyiProMixto the proteomic data of 110 (tumor adjacent) normal lung tissue samples from the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium lung adenocarcinoma study, and identify interferonα/γresponse pathways as the most significant pathways associated with ACE2 protein abundances in epithelial cells. Strikingly, the association direction is sex-specific. This result casts light on the sex difference of COVID-19 incidences and outcomes, and motivates sex-specific evaluation for interferon therapies."
"37491308","Overcoming attenuation bias in regressions using polygenic indices.","Nat Commun","Measurement error in polygenic indices (PGIs) attenuates the estimation of their effects in regression models. We analyze and compare two approaches addressing this attenuation bias: Obviously Related Instrumental Variables (ORIV) and the PGI Repository Correction (PGI-RC). Through simulations, we show that the PGI-RC performs slightly better than ORIV, unless the prediction sample is very small (N < 1000) or when there is considerable assortative mating. Within families, ORIV is the best choice since the PGI-RC correction factor is generally not available. We verify the empirical validity of the simulations by predicting educational attainment and height in a sample of siblings from the UK Biobank. We show that applying ORIV between families increases the standardized effect of the PGI by 12% (height) and by 22% (educational attainment) compared to a meta-analysis-based PGI, yet estimates remain slightly below the PGI-RC estimates. Furthermore, within-family ORIV regression provides the tightest lower bound for the direct genetic effect, increasing the lower bound for the standardized direct genetic effect on educational attainment from 0.14 to 0.18 (+29%), and for height from 0.54 to 0.61 (+13%) compared to a meta-analysis-based PGI.© 2023.

"37445676","Methylation-Regulated Long Non-Coding RNA Expression in Ulcerative Colitis.","Int J Mol Sci","Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC). Although epigenetic processes such as DNA methylation and lncRNA expression are well studied in UC, the importance of the interplay between the two processes has not yet been fully explored. It is, therefore, believed that interactions between environmental factors and epigenetics contribute to disease development. Mucosal biopsies from 11 treatment-naïve UC patients and 13 normal controls were used in this study. From each individual sample, both whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data (WGBS) and lncRNA expression data were analyzed. Correlation analysis between lncRNA expression and upstream differentially methylated regions (DMRs) was used to identify lncRNAs that might be regulated by DMRs. Furthermore, proximal protein-coding genes associated with DMR-regulated lncRNAs were identified by correlating their expression. The study identified UC-associated lncRNAs such as MIR4435-2HG, ZFAS1, IL6-AS1, and Pvt1, which may be regulated by DMRs. Several genes that are involved in inflammatory immune responses were found downstream of DMR-regulated lncRNAs, including SERPINB1, CCL18, and SLC15A4. The interplay between lncRNA expression regulated by DNA methylation in UC might improve our understanding of UC pathogenesis."

Furthermore, non-pharmacological interventions to address sarcopenia in patients with these conditions are suggested. The significance of combined training in managing metabolic disease and secondary sarcopenia in type II diabetes mellitus is emphasized. Additionally, the potential benefits of resistance and aerobic training are explored. This review emphasises the role of nutrition in addressing sarcopenia in patients with CVD or MDs, focusing on strategies such as optimising protein intake, promoting plant-based protein sources, incorporating antioxidant-rich foods and omega-3 fatty acids and ensuring sufficient vitamin D levels. Moreover, the potential benefits of targeting gut microbiota through probiotics and prebiotic fibres in sarcopenic individuals are considered. Multidisciplinary approaches that integrate behavioural science are explored to enhance the uptake and sustainability of behaviour-based sarcopenia interventions. Future research should prioritise high-quality randomized controlled trials to refine exercise and nutritional interventions and investigate the incorporation of behavioural science into routine practices. Ultimately, a comprehensive and multifaceted approach is essential to improve health outcomes, well-being and quality of life in older adults with sarcopenia and coexisting cardiovascular and metabolic diseases."

We downloaded HCC mRNA-seq expression and clinical data from University of California Santa Cruz Xena. The expression of LRRC1 was compared between HCC tumor and normal samples. Tumor samples were divided according to high and low LRRC1 expression. Differentially expressed genes between the 2 groups were identified, and function, mutation, and immune cell infiltration were analyzed. Genes associated with immune cells were identified using weighted gene co-expression network analysis, and transcription factors of these genes were predicted. Moreover, a prognostic model was developed and its performance was evaluated. The expression of LRRC1 was upregulated in HCC tissues, and this indicated a poor prognosis for patients with HCC. Differentially expressed genes between high and low LRRC1 expression were significantly enriched in pathways associated with cancer, amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, and the immune system. We identified 15 differentially infiltrated immune cells between tumors with high and low LRRC1 expression and 14 of them correlated with LRRC1 gene expression. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis identified 83 immune cell-related genes, 27 of which had prognostic value. Cyclic AMP-response element binding protein regulated annexin A5, matrix metallopeptidase 9, and LRRC1 in the transcription factor regulatory network. Finally, a prognostic model composed of 7 genes were generated, which could accurately predict the prognosis of HCC patients. The LRRC1 gene might serve as a potential immune-associated prognostic biomarker for HCC.Copyright © 2023 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc."

Herein, we investigated the hypoxia-based heterogeneity and relevant clinical implication in HCC.Three HCC cohorts: TCGA-LIHC, LICA-FR, and LIRI-JP were retrospectively gathered. Consensus clustering analysis was utilized for hypoxia-based classification based upon transcriptome of hypoxia genes. Through LASSO algorithm, a hypoxia-relevant prognostic signature was built. Immunotherapeutic response was inferred through analyzing immune checkpoints, T cell inflamed score, TIDE score, and TMB score. RNF145 expression was measured in normoxic or hypoxic HCC cells. In RNF145-knockout cells, CCK-8, TUNEL, and scratch tests were implemented.HCC patients were classified into two hypoxia subtypes, with more advanced stages and poorer prognosis in cluster2 than cluster1. The heterogeneity in tumor infiltrating immune cells and genetic mutation was found between subtypes. The hypoxia-relevant prognostic model was proposed, composed of ANLN, CBX2, DLGAP5, FBLN2, FTCD, HMOX1, IGLV1-44, IL33, LCAT, LPCAT1, MKI67, PFN2, RNF145, S100A9, and SPP1). It was predicted that high-risk patients presented worse prognosis with an independent and reliable manner. Based upon high expression of immune checkpoints (CD209, CTLA4, HAVCR2, SIRPA, TNFRSF18, TNFRSF4, and TNFRSF9), high T cell inflamed score, low TIDE score and high TMB score, high-risk patients might respond to immunotherapy. Experimental validation showed that RNF145 was upregulated in hypoxic HCC cells, RNF145 knockdown attenuated proliferation and migration, but aggravated apoptosis in HCC cells.Altogether, the hypoxia-based classification and prognostic signature might be useful for prognostication and guiding treatment of HCC.© 2023.

Therefore, there is a need to systematically identify important predictors of such risks. This study aims to provide insight into forecasting and understanding risk perceptions and help to adjust interventions that target various social groups in different pandemic phases.This study was based on survey data collected from 5001 Norwegians in 2020 and 2021. Interpretable machine learning algorithms were used to predict perceived exposure risks. To detect the most important predictors, the models with best performance were chosen based on predictive errors and explained variances. Shapley additive values were used to examine individual heterogeneities, interpret feature impact and check interactions between the key predictors.Gradient boosting machine exhibited the best model performance in this study (2020: RMSE=.93, MAE=.74, RSQ=.22; 2021: RMSE=.99, MAE=.77, RSQ=.12). The most influential predictors of perceived exposure risk were compliance with interventions, work-life conflict, age and gender. In 2020, work and occupation played a dominant role in predicting perceived risks whereas, in 2021, living and behavioural factors were among the most important predictors. Findings show large individual heterogeneities in feature importance based on people's sociodemographic backgrounds, work and living situations.The findings provide insight into forecasting risk groups and contribute to the early detection of vulnerable people during the pandemic.

DNA damage repair (DDR) is a complicated process for signal transduction that causes cancer. lncRNAs can influence the formation and incidence of cancers by influencing DDR-related mRNAs/miRNAs. A DDR-related lncRNA prognostic model is urgently needed to improve treatment strategies.The data of GC samples were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets. A total of 588 mRNAs involved in DDR were selected from MSigDB, 62 differentially expressed mRNAs from TCGA-STAD were obtained, and 137 lncRNAs were correlated with these mRNAs. Univariate Cox regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analyses were used to develop a DDR-related lncRNA prognostic model. Based on the risk model, the differentially expressed gene signature A/B in the low-risk and high-risk groups of TCGA-STAD was identified for further validation.The prognosis model of 5 genes (AC145285.6, MAGI2-AS3, AL590705.3, AC007405.3, and LINC00106) was constructed and classified into two risk groups. We found that GC patients with a low-risk score had a better OS than those with a high-risk score. We found that the high-risk group tended to have higher TME scores. We also found that patients in the high-risk group had a higher proportion of resting CD4 T cells, monocytes, M2 macrophages, resting dendritic cells, and resting mast cells, whereas the low-risk subgroup had a greater abundance of activated CD4 T cells, follicular helper T cells, M0 macrophages, and M1 macrophages. We observed significant differences in the T-cell exclusion score, T-cell dysfunction, MSI, and TMB between the two risk groups. In addition, we found that patients treated with immunotherapy in the low-RS score group had a longer survival and a better prognosis than those in the high-RS score group.The prognostic model has a significant role in the TME, clinicopathological characteristics, prognosis, MSI, and drug sensitivity.

Aging-related genes (ARGs) are believed to contribute significantly to tumor development. However, the effect of ARGs on lymphatic metastasis of BCa is unclear. This research sought to establish a prognosis model based on ARGs associated with lymphatic metastasis in BCa.We downloaded BCa data from the TCGA and GEO databases and ARGs from the Aging Atlas database. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) approach was applied to obtain the characteristic ARGs of risk signature in the TCGA cohort. Verification was done using the GSE13507 dataset. The R package 'ConsensusClusterPlus' was employed to identify the molecular subtypes based on the characteristic ARGs. Protein-Protein interaction network, MCODE analysis, enrichment analysis (KEGG, GO, GSEA), and immune infiltration analysis were performed to investigate underlying mechanisms. EdU, migration and invasion assays, wound healing assays, immunofluorescence staining, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction were conducted to evaluate the impact of ELN on the proliferative, migratory, and invasive capacities of BCa cells.We identified 20 differently expressed ARGs. A four ARGs risk signature (EFEMP1,UCHL1,TP63,ELN) was constructed in the TCGA cohort. The high-risk group (category) recorded a reduced overall survival (OS) rate relative to the low-risk category (hazard ratio, 2.15; P <0.001). The risk score could predict lymphatic metastasis in TCGA cohort (AUC=0.67). The GSE13507 dataset was employed to verify the validity of this risk score. Based on the four ARGs, two distinct aging profiles (Cluster 1 and Cluster 2) were discovered utilizing the ConsensusClusterPlus, and Cluster 2 possessed a favorable OS in contrast with Cluster 1 (hazard ratio, 0.69; P =0.02). Classical tumor signaling pathways, ECM-associated signaling pathways, and immune-related signaling pathways participate in BCa progression. ELN recombinant protein affected the expression of collagen and increased migration and invasiveness in BCa cells.We constructed a four-ARG risk signature and identified two aging molecular subtypes. This signature could serve as an effective survival predictor for patients with BCa.Copyright © 2023 Zhu, Li, Liu and Li."

However, the prognostic value of disulfidptosis-related genes (DRGs) in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remains to be further elucidated. In this study, consistent cluster analysis was used to classify 571 RCC samples into three DRG-related subtypes based on changes in DRGs expression. Through univariate regression analysis and LASSO-Cox regression analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among three subtypes, we constructed and validated a DRG risk score to predict the prognosis of patients with RCC, while also identifying three gene subtypes. Analysis of DRG risk score, clinical characteristics, tumor microenvironment (TME), somatic cell mutations, and immunotherapy sensitivity revealed significant correlations between them. A series of studies have shown thatMSH3can be a potential biomarker of RCC, and its low expression is associated with poor prognosis in patients with RCC. Last but not least, overexpression ofMSH3promotes cell death in two RCC cell lines under glucose starvation conditions, indicating thatMSH3is a key gene in the process of cell disulfidptosis. In summary, we identify potential mechanism of RCC progression through DRGs -related tumor microenvironment remodeling. In addition, this study has successfully established a new disulfidptosis-related genes prediction model and discovered a key geneMSH3.

Our study aimed to identify the necroptosis-related differentially expressed genes (NRDEGs), create a diagnosis model and related disease subtypes model based on these genes, and further investigate their relationship with immune infiltration.In this study, we identified NRDEGs by analyzing data from various databases, including Molecular Signatures, GeneCards, and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Using minor absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and logistic Cox regression analysis, we developed a novel PE diagnosis model based on NRDEGs. Furthermore, we developed PE subtype models using consensus clustering analysis based on key gene modules screened out by weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA). Finally, we identified the difference in immune infiltration between the PE and control groups as well as between both PE subtypes by analyzing the immune cell infiltration across combined datasets and PE datasets.Our study discovered that the necroptosis pathway was significantly enriched and active in PE samples. We identified nine NRDEGs that involved in this pathway, including BRAF, PAWR, USP22, SYNCRIP, KRT86, MERTK, BAP1, CXCL5, and STK38. Additionally, we developed a diagnostic model based on a regression model including six NRDEGs and identified two PE subtypes: Cluster1 and Cluster2, based on key module genes. Furthermore, correlation analysis showed that the abundance of immune cell infiltration was related to necroptosis genes and PE disease subtypes.According to the present study, necroptosis is a phenomenon that occurs in PE and is connected to immune cell infiltration. This result suggests that necroptosis and immune-related factors may be the underlying mechanisms of PE pathophysiology.

Gene expression matrix was obtained from GEO database indexed GSE196399. Three machine learning algorithms were applied: The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), the random forest, and the support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE). Immune cell infiltration was quantified by single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) scoring. Nomogram was constructed to verify the applicability of using cuproptosis-related genes to predict the onset of severe CAP and its deterioration toward ARDS.Nine cuproptosis-related genes were differentially expressed between the severe CAP group and the control group: ATP7B, DBT, DLAT, DLD, FDX1, GCSH, LIAS, LIPT1, and SLC31A1. All 13 cuproptosis-related genes were involved in immune cell infiltration.

Additionally, we aimed to identify the underlying mechanisms contributing to delirium and provide evidence for reducing the risk of delirium. In this study, to mimic an ICU environment, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-injected sepsis mouse models were exposed to a 75 dB noise condition. Furthermore, we assessed neurobehavioral function and observed the level of neuroinflammatory response and blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity in the hippocampal region. The LPS-injected sepsis mouse model exposed to noise exhibited increased anxiety-like behavior and cognitive impairment. Moreover, severe neuroinflammation and BBB disruption were detected in the hippocampal region. This study provides insights suggesting that persistent noise exposure under systemic inflammatory conditions may cause cognitive dysfunction and anxiety- like behavior via the mediation of BBB disruption and neuroinflammation. As a result, we suggest that the detailed regulation of noise exposure may be required to prevent the development of postoperative delirium."

Liquid biopsy is a minimally invasive technique, which is widely used to detect molecular biomarkers of tumors without invasive biopsy. Compared with the field of oncology, it is not easy to get the diseased tissue in CVD, especially CHD. Therefore, the idea of ""fluid biopsy"" is very attractive, and its progress may provide new and useful noninvasive indicators for CHD. By analyzing circulating cells or their products in blood, saliva, and urine samples, we can investigate the molecular changes that occur in each patient at a specific point in time, thus continuously monitoring the evolution of CHD. For example, the assessment of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) levels may help predict the severity of acute myocardial infarction and diagnose heart transplant rejection. Moreover, the unmethylated FAM101A gene may specifically track the cfDNA derived from cardiomyocyte death, which provides a powerful diagnostic biomarker for apoptosis during ischemia. In addition, the changes of plasma circulating miR-92 levels may predict the occurrence of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) onset in patients with diabetes. Liquid biopsy can reflect the disease state through patients' body fluids and may noninvasively provide dynamic and rich molecular information related to CHD. It has great application potential in early warning and auxiliary diagnosis, real-time monitoring of curative effect, medication guidance and exploration of drug resistance mechanism, prognosis judgment, and risk classification of CHD. This chapter will review the latest progress of liquid biopsy in accurate diagnosis and treatment of CHD, meanwhile explore the application status and clinical prospect of liquid biopsy in CHD, in order to improve the importance of precision medicine and personalized treatment in this field.© 2023.

Chronic inflammation plays a significant role in obesity-induced cardiomyopathy and may provide new therapeutic targets for this disease. Doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) is an important target for cancer therapy and the role of DCLK1 in obesity and cardiovascular diseases is unclear. Herein, we showed that DCLK1 was overexpressed in the cardiac tissue of obese mice and investigated the role of DCLK1 in obesity-induced cardiomyopathy. We generated DCLK1-deleted mice and showed that macrophage-specific DCLK1 knockout, rather than cardiomyocyte-specific DCLK1 knockout, prevented high-fat diet (HFD)-induced heart dysfunction, cardiac hypertrophy, and fibrosis. RNA sequencing analysis showed that DCLK1 deficiency exerted cardioprotective effects by suppressing RIP2/TAK1 activation and inflammatory responses in macrophages. Upon HFD/palmitate (PA) challenge, macrophage DCLK1 mediates RIP2/TAK1 phosphorylation and subsequent inflammatory cytokine release, which further promotes hypertrophy in cardiomyocytes and fibrogenesis in fibroblasts. Finally, a pharmacological inhibitor of DCLK1 significantly protects hearts in HFD-fed mice. Our study demonstrates a novel role and a pro-inflammatory mechanism of macrophage DCLK1 in obesity-induced cardiomyopathy and identifies DCLK1 as a new therapeutic target for the treatment of this disease. Upon HFD/PA challenge, DCLK1 induces RIP2/TAK1-mediated inflammatory response in macrophages, which subsequently promotes cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. Macrophage-specific DCLK1 deletion or pharmacological inhibition of DCLK1 protects hearts in HFD-fed mice.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37492785","Liquid biopsies for cancer: From bench to clinic.","MedComm (2020)","Over the past two decades, liquid biopsy has been increasingly used as a supplement, or even, a replacement to the traditional biopsy in clinical oncological practice, due to its noninvasive and early detectable properties. The detections can be based on a variety of features extracted from tumor‑derived entities, such as quantitative alterations, genetic changes, and epigenetic aberrations, and so on. So far, the clinical applications of cancer liquid biopsy mainly aimed at two aspects, prediction (early diagnosis, prognosis and recurrent evaluation, therapeutic response monitoring, etc.) and intervention. In spite of the rapid development and great contributions achieved, cancer liquid biopsy is still a field under investigation and deserves more clinical practice. To better open up future work, here we systematically reviewed and compared the latest progress of the most widely recognized circulating components, including circulating tumor cells, cell-free circulating DNA, noncoding RNA, and nucleosomes, from their discovery histories to clinical values. According to the features applied, we particularly divided the contents into two parts, beyond epigenetics and epigenetic-based. The latter was considered as the highlight along with a brief overview of the advances in both experimental and bioinformatic approaches, due to its unique advantages and relatively lack of documentation.© 2023 The Authors.

"37524743","Temporal relationships between BMI and obesity-related predictors of cardiometabolic and breast cancer risk in a longitudinal cohort.","Sci Rep","Prospective inter-relationships among biomarkers were unexplored, which may provide mechanistic insights into diseases. We investigated the longitudinal associations of BMI change with trajectories of biomarkers related to cardiometabolic or breast cancer risk. A longitudinal study was conducted among 444 healthy women between 2019 to 2021. Cross‑lagged path analysis was used to examine the temporal relationships among BMI, cardiometabolic risk score (CRS), and obesity‑related proteins score (OPS) of breast cancer. Linear mixed-effect models were applied to investigate associations of time-varying BMI with biomarker-based risk score trajectories. Baseline BMI was associated with subsequent change of breast cancer predictors (P = 0.03), and baseline CRS were positively associated with OPS change (P < 0.001) but not vice versa. After fully adjustment of confounders, we found a 0.058 (95%CI = 0.009-0.107, P = 0.020) units increase of CRS and a 1.021 (95%CI = 0.041-1.995, P = 0.040) units increase of OPS as BMI increased 1 kg/m2per year in postmenopausal women. OPS increased 0.784 (95%CI = 0.053-1.512, P = 0.035) units as CRS increased 1 unit per year. However, among premenopausal women, BMI only significantly affected CRS (β = 0.057, 95%CI = 0.007 to 0.107, P = 0.025). No significant change of OPS with time-varying CRS was found. Higher increase rates of BMI were associated with worse trajectories of biomarker-based risk of cardiometabolic and breast cancer. The longitudinal impact of CRS on OPS is unidirectional. Recommendations such as weight control for the reduction of cardiometabolic risk factors may benefit breast cancer prevention, especially in postmenopausal women.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37510410","Epigenetic Aberrations in Major Psychiatric Diseases Related to Diet and Gut Microbiome Alterations.","Genes (Basel)","Nutrition and metabolism modify epigenetic signatures like histone acetylation and DNA methylation. Histone acetylation and DNA methylation in the central nervous system (CNS) can be altered by bioactive nutrients and gut microbiome via the gut-brain axis, which in turn modulate neuronal activity and behavior. Notably, the gut microbiome, with more than 1000 bacterial species, collectively contains almost three million functional genes whose products interact with millions of human epigenetic marks and 30,000 genes in a dynamic manner. However, genetic makeup shapes gut microbiome composition, food/nutrient metabolism, and epigenetic landscape, as well. Here, we first discuss the effect of changes in the microbial structure and composition in shaping specific epigenetic alterations in the brain and their role in the onset and progression of major mental disorders. Afterward, potential interactions among maternal diet/environmental factors, nutrition, and gastrointestinal microbiome, and their roles in accelerating or delaying the onset of severe mental illnesses via epigenetic changes will be discussed. We also provide an overview of the association between the gut microbiome, oxidative stress, and inflammation through epigenetic mechanisms. Finally, we present some underlying mechanisms involved in mediating the influence of the gut microbiome and probiotics on mental health via epigenetic modifications."
"37441522","Epigenetic effects of short-chain fatty acids from the large intestine on host cells.","Microlife","Adult humans harbor at least as many microbial cells as eukaryotic ones. The largest compartment of this diverse microbial population,the gut microbiota, encompasses the collection of bacteria, archaea, viruses, and eukaryotic organisms that populate the gastrointestinal tract, and represents a complex and dynamic ecosystem that has been increasingly implicated in health and disease. The gut microbiota carries ∼100-to-150-times more genes than the human genome and is intimately involved in development, homeostasis, and disease. Of the several microbial metabolites that have been studied, short-chain fatty acids emerge as a group of molecules that shape gene expression in several types of eukaryotic cells by multiple mechanisms, which include DNA methylation changes, histone post-translational modifications, and microRNA-mediated gene silencing. Butyric acid, one of the most extensively studied short-chain fatty acids, reaches higher concentrations in the colonic lumen, where it provides a source of energy for healthy colonocytes, and its concentrations decrease towards the bottom of the colonic crypts, where stem cells reside. The lower butyric acid concentration in the colonic crypts allows undifferentiated cells, such as stem cells, to progress through the cell cycle, pointing towards the importance of the crypts in providing them with a protective niche. In cancerous colonocytes, which metabolize relatively little butyric acid and mostly rely on glycolysis, butyric acid preferentially acts as a histone deacetylase inhibitor, leading to decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. A better understanding of the interface between the gut microbiota metabolites and epigenetic changes in eukaryotic cells promises to unravel in more detail processes that occur physiologically and as part of disease, help develop novel biomarkers, and identify new therapeutic modalities.© The Author(s) 2023.

This study integrates multi-omics data of different cancer types with a network-based approach to explore common gene modules among different tumors by running community detection methods on the integrated network. The common modules were evaluated by several biological metrics adapted to cancer. Then, a new prognostic scoring method was developed by weighting mRNA expression, methylation, and mutation status of genes. The survival analysis pointed out statistically significant results forGNG11,CBX2,CDKN3,ARHGEF10,CLN8,SEC61GandPTDSS1genes. The literature search reveals that the identified biomarkers are associated with the same or different types of cancers. Our method does not only identify known cancer-specific biomarker genes, but also proposes new potential biomarkers. Thus, this study provides a rationale for identifying new gene targets and expanding treatment options across cancer types."
"37409096","DNA methylation biomarkers distinguishing early-stage prostate cancer from benign prostatic hyperplasia.","Prostate Int","DNA methylation markers are considered robust diagnostic features in various cancer types, as epigenetic marks are commonly altered during cancer progression. Differentiation between benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and early-stage prostate cancer (PCa) is clinically difficult, relying on the information of the patient's symptoms or levels of prostate-specific antigen.A total of 42 PCa patients and 11 BPH patients were recruited. Genomic DNA was purified from tissues and used for the library preparation of the target-enriched methylome with enzymatic conversion and a Twist 85 Mbp EM-seq panel. Paired-end sequencing (150 bp) was performed using NovaSeq 6000 or NextSeq 550. After quality control, including adapter trimming and de-duplication of raw sequencing data, differential methylation patterns were analyzed between the BPH and PCa groups.We report DNA methylation patterns existing between BPH and PCa. The major finding is that broad hypermethylation occurred at genic loci in PCa tissues as compared to the BPH. Gene ontology analysis suggested that hypermethylation of genic loci involved in chromatin and transcriptional regulation is involved in cancer progression. We also compared PCa tissues with high Gleason scores to tissues with low Gleason scores. The high-Gleason PCa tissues showed hundreds of focal differentially methylated CpG sites corresponding to genes functioning in cancer cell proliferation or metastasis. This suggests that dissecting early-to-advanced-grade cancer stages requires an in-depth analysis of differential methylation at the single CpG site level.Our study reports that enzymatic methylome sequencing data can be used to distinguish PCa from BPH and advanced PCa from early-stage PCa. The stage-specific methylation patterns in this study will be valuable resources for diagnostic purposes as well as further development of liquid biopsy approaches for the early detection of PCa.© 2023 The Asian Pacific Prostate Society.

"37520228","The influence of tissue pH and RNA integrity number on gene expression of human postmortem brain.","Front Psychiatry","Evaluating and controlling confounders are necessary when investigating molecular pathogenesis using human postmortem brain tissue. Particularly, tissue pH and RNA integrity number (RIN) are valuable indicators for controlling confounders. However, the influences of these indicators on the expression of each gene in postmortem brain have not been fully investigated. Therefore, we aimed to assess these effects on gene expressions of human brain samples.We isolated total RNA from occipital lobes of 13 patients with schizophrenia and measured the RIN and tissue pH. Gene expression was analyzed and gene sets affected by tissue pH and RIN were identified. Moreover, we examined the functions of these genes by enrichment analysis and upstream regulator analysis.We identified 2,043 genes (24.7%) whose expressions were highly correlated with pH; 3,004 genes (36.3%) whose expressions were highly correlated with RIN; and 1,293 genes (15.6%) whose expressions were highly correlated with both pH and RIN. Genes commonly affected by tissue pH and RIN were highly associated with energy production and the immune system. In addition, genes uniquely affected by tissue pH were highly associated with the cell cycle, whereas those uniquely affected by RIN were highly associated with RNA processing.The current study elucidated the influence of pH and RIN on gene expression profiling and identified gene sets whose expressions were affected by tissue pH or RIN. These findings would be helpful in the control of confounders for future postmortem brain studies.Copyright © 2023 Miyahara, Hino, Yu, Ono, Nagaoka, Hatano, Shishido, Yabe, Tomita and Kunii."

The initial leading FTLD-TDP genome-wide association study (GWAS) hit at this locus, rs1990622, is intergenic and is in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with aTMEM106Bcoding SNV, rs3173615. We developed a long-read sequencing (LRS) dataset of 407 individuals in order to identify structural variants associated with neurodegenerative disorders. We identified a prevalent 322 base pair deletion on theTMEM106B3' untranslated region (UTR) that was in perfect linkage with rs1990622 and near-perfect linkage with rs3173615 (genotype discordance in two of 274 individuals who had LRS and short-read next-generation sequencing). In Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) participants, this deletion was in greater LD with rs1990622 (R2=0.920916, D'=0.963472) than with rs3173615 (R2=0.883776, D'=0.963575). rs1990622 and rs3173615 are less closely linked (R2=0.7403, D'=0.9915) in African populations. Among African ancestry individuals in the ADSP, the deletion is in even greater LD with rs1990622 (R2=0.936841, D'=0.976782) than with rs3173615 (R2=0.764242, D'=0.974406). Querying publicly available genetic datasets with associated mRNA expression and protein levels, we confirmed that rs1990622 is consistently a protein quantitative trait locus but not an expression quantitative trait locus, consistent with a causal variant present on theTMEM106B3'UTR. In summary, theTMEM106B3' UTR deletion is a large genetic variant on theTMEM106Btranscript that is in higher LD with the leading GWAS hit rs1990622 than rs3173615 and may mediate the protective effect of this locus in neurodegenerative disease."
"37398070","Genetic mechanisms for impaired synaptic plasticity in schizophrenia revealed by computational modelling.","bioRxiv","Schizophrenia phenotypes are suggestive of impaired cortical plasticity in the disease, but the mechanisms of these deficits are unknown. Genomic association studies have implicated a large number of genes that regulate neuromodulation and plasticity, indicating that the plasticity deficits have a genetic origin. Here, we used biochemically detailed computational modelling of post-synaptic plasticity to investigate how schizophrenia-associated genes regulate long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD). We combined our model with data from post-mortem mRNA expression studies (CommonMind gene-expression datasets) to assess the consequences of altered expression of plasticity-regulating genes for the amplitude of LTP and LTD. Our results show that the expression alterations observedpost mortem, especially those in anterior cingulate cortex, lead to impaired PKA-pathway-mediated LTP in synapses containing GluR1 receptors. We validated these findings using a genotyped EEG dataset where polygenic risk scores for synaptic and ion channel-encoding genes as well as modulation of visual evoked potentials (VEP) were determined for 286 healthy controls. Our results provide a possible genetic mechanism for plasticity impairments in schizophrenia, which can lead to improved understanding and, ultimately, treatment of the disorder."

Adverse childhood experiences (ACE) increase PTSD risk in adulthood. Epigenetic mechanisms play important roles in PTSD pathogenesis and a mutation in the methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2) in mice provide susceptibility to PTSD-like alterations, with sex-dependent biological signatures. The present study examined whether the increased risk of PTSD associated with ACE exposure is accompanied by reduced MECP2 blood levels in humans, with an influence of sex. MECP2 mRNA levels were analyzed in the blood of 132 subjects (58 women). Participants were interviewed to assess PTSD symptomatology, and asked to retrospectively report ACE. Among trauma-exposed women, MECP2 downregulation was associated with the intensification of PTSD symptoms linked to ACE exposure. MECP2 expression emerges as a potential contributor to post-trauma pathophysiology fostering novel studies on the molecular mechanisms underlying its potential sex-dependent role in PTSD onset and progression.© 2023.

"37468957","Abnormal DNA methylation within genes of the steroidogenesis pathway two years after paediatric critical illness and association with stunted growth in height further in time.","Clin Epigenetics","Former critically ill children show an epigenetic age deceleration 2 years after paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission as compared with normally developing healthy children, with stunted growth in height 2 years further in time as physical correlate. This was particularly pronounced in children who were 6 years or older at the time of critical illness. As this age roughly corresponds to the onset of adrenarche and further pubertal development, a relation with altered activation of endocrine pathways is plausible. We hypothesised that children who have been admitted to the PICU, sex- and age-dependently show long-term abnormal DNA methylation within genes involved in steroid hormone synthesis or steroid sulphation/desulphation, possibly aggravated by in-PICU glucocorticoid treatment, which may contribute to stunted growth in height further in time after critical illness.In this preplanned secondary analysis of the multicentre PEPaNIC-RCT and its follow-up, we compared the methylation status of genes involved in the biosynthesis of steroid hormones (aldosterone, cortisol and sex hormones) and steroid sulphation/desulphation in buccal mucosa DNA (Infinium HumanMethylation EPIC BeadChip) from former PICU patients at 2-year follow-up (n = 818) and healthy children with comparable sex and age (n = 392). Adjusting for technical variation and baseline risk factors and corrected for multiple testing (false discovery rate < 0.05), former PICU patients showed abnormal DNA methylation of 23 CpG sites (within CYP11A1, POR, CYB5A, HSD17B1, HSD17B2, HSD17B3, HSD17B6, HSD17B10, HSD17B12, CYP19A1, CYP21A2, and CYP11B2) and 4 DNA regions (within HSD17B2, HSD17B8, and HSD17B10) that were mostly hypomethylated. These abnormalities were partially sex- (1 CpG site) or age-dependent (7 CpG sites) and affected by glucocorticoid treatment (3 CpG sites). Finally, multivariable linear models identified robust associations of abnormal methylation of steroidogenic genes with shorter height further in time, at 4-year follow-up.Children who have been critically ill show abnormal methylation within steroidogenic genes 2 years after PICU admission, which explained part of the stunted growth in height at 4-year follow-up. The abnormalities in DNA methylation may point to a long-term disturbance in the balance between active sex steroids and mineralocorticoids/glucocorticoids after paediatric critical illness, which requires further investigation.© 2023.

"37509188","Graph Random Forest: A Graph Embedded Algorithm for Identifying Highly Connected Important Features.","Biomolecules","Random Forest (RF) is a widely used machine learning method with good performance on classification and regression tasks. It works well under low sample size situations, which benefits applications in the field of biology. For example, gene expression data often involve much larger numbers of features (p) compared to the size of samples (n). Though the predictive accuracy using RF is often high, there are some problems when selecting important genes using RF. The important genes selected by RF are usually scattered on the gene network, which conflicts with the biological assumption of functional consistency between effective features. To improve feature selection by incorporating external topological information between genes, we propose the Graph Random Forest (GRF) for identifying highly connected important features by involving the known biological network when constructing the forest. The algorithm can identify effective features that form highly connected sub-graphs and achieve equivalent classification accuracy to RF. To evaluate the capability of our proposed method, we conducted simulation experiments and applied the method to two real datasets-non-small cell lung cancer RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, and human embryonic stem cell RNA-seq dataset (GSE93593). The resulting high classification accuracy, connectivity of selected sub-graphs, and interpretable feature selection results suggest the method is a helpful addition to graph-based classification models and feature selection procedures."
"37496754","The immunogenic radiation and new players in immunotherapy and targeted therapy for head and neck cancer.","Front Oral Health","Although treatment modalities for head and neck cancer have evolved considerably over the past decades, survival rates have plateaued. The treatment options remained limited to definitive surgery, surgery followed by fractionated radiotherapy with optional chemotherapy, and a definitive combination of fractionated radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Lately, immunotherapy has been introduced as the fourth modality of treatment, mainly administered as a single checkpoint inhibitor for recurrent or metastatic disease. While other regimens and combinations of immunotherapy and targeted therapy are being tested in clinical trials, adapting the appropriate regimens to patients and predicting their outcomes have yet to reach the clinical setting. Radiotherapy is mainly regarded as a means to target cancer cells while minimizing the unwanted peripheral effect. Radiotherapy regimens and fractionation are designed to serve this purpose, while the systemic effect of radiation on the immune response is rarely considered a factor while designing treatment. To bridge this gap, this review will highlight the effect of radiotherapy on the tumor microenvironment locally, and the immune response systemically. We will review the methodology to identify potential targets for therapy in the tumor microenvironment and the scientific basis for combining targeted therapy and radiotherapy. We will describe a current experience in preclinical models to test these combinations and propose how challenges in this realm may be faced. We will review new players in targeted therapy and their utilization to drive immunogenic response against head and neck cancer. We will outline the factors contributing to head and neck cancer heterogeneity and their effect on the response to radiotherapy. We will reviewin-silicomethods to decipher intertumoral and intratumoral heterogeneity and how these algorithms can predict treatment outcomes. We propose that (a) the sequence of surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy should be designed not only to annul cancer directly, but to prime the immune response. (b) Fractionation of radiotherapy and the extent of the irradiated field should facilitate systemic immunity to develop. (c) New players in targeted therapy should be evaluated in translational studies toward clinical trials.

We designed a pilot study and aimed to investigate the performance of mSEPT9, AFP, PIVKA-II and their combination in hepatic cirrhosis (HC) population.A training cohort was established including 103 HCC and 114 HC patients. 10 ml blood was collected from each patient with K2EDTA tubes, and 3-4 ml plasma was extracted for subsequent tests. The performance of mSEPT9, AFP, PIVKA-II and their combination was optimized by the training cohort. Test performance was prospectively validated with a validation cohort, including 51 HCC and 121 HC patients.At the optimal thresholds in the training cohort, the sensitivity, specificity and area under curve (AUC) was 72.82%, 89.47%, 0.84, and 48.57%, 89.92%, 0.79, and 63.64%, 95.95%, 0.79 for mSEPT9, AFP and PIVKA-II, respectively. The combined test significantly increased the sensitivity to 84.47% (P < 0.05) at the specificity of 86.84% with an AUC of 0.91. Stage-dependent performance was observed with all single markers and their combination in plasma marker levels, positive detection rate (PDR) and AUC. Moderate correlation was found between mSEPT9 and AFP plasma levels (r = 0.527, P < 0.0001). Good complementarity was found between any two of the three markers, providing optimal sensitivity in HCC detection when used in combination. Subsequent validation achieved a sensitivity, specificity and AUC of 65.31%, 92.86%, 0.80, and 44.24%, 89.26%, 0.75, and 62.22%, 95.27%, 0.78 for mSEPT9, AFP and PIVKA-II, respectively. The combined test yielded a significantly increased sensitivity of 84.00% (P < 0.05) at 85.57% specificity, with an AUC at 0.89.The performance was optimal by the combination of mSEPT9, AFP, PIVKA-II compared with any single marker, and the combination may be effective for HCC opportunistic screening in HC population.© 2023.

Here, we examined age- and sex-dependent dynamic changes of the hippocampal synaptic proteome after maternal immune activation (MIA) in embryonic and adult mice. Adult male and female MIA offspring exhibited social deficits and sex-specific depression-like behaviours, among others, validating the model. Furthermore, we observed dose-, age-, and sex-dependent synaptic proteome differences. Analysis of the embryonic synaptic proteome implicates sphingolipid and ketoacid metabolism pathway disruptions during neurodevelopment for NPD-pertinent sequelae. In the embryonic hippocampus, prenatal immune activation also led to changes in neuronal guidance, glycosphingolipid metabolism important for signalling and myelination, and post-translational modification of proteins that regulate intercellular interaction and developmental timing. In adulthood, the observed changes in synaptoneurosomes revealed a dynamic shift toward transmembrane trafficking, intracellular signalling cascades, and hormone-mediated metabolism. Importantly, 68 of the proteins with differential abundance in the embryonic brains of MIA offspring were also altered in adulthood, 75% of which retained their directionality. These proteins are involved in synaptic organisation, neurotransmitter receptor regulation, and the vesicle cycle. A cluster of persistently upregulated proteins, including AKT3, PAK1/3, PPP3CA, formed a functional network enriched in the embryonic brain that is involved in cellular responses to environmental stimuli. To infer a link between the overlapping protein alterations and cognitive and psychiatric traits, we probed human phenome-wise association study data for cognitive and psychiatric phenotypes and all, but PORCN were significantly associated with the investigated domains. Our data provide insights into the dynamic effects of an early prenatal immune activation on developing and mature hippocampi and highlights targets for early intervention in individuals exposed to such immune challenges."

Weighted co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) of TCGA data identified mitochondrial DNA methylation (MTDM)-associated genes in BC. COX regression and LASSO regression were used to build prognostic models. The biological function of MTDM was assessed using various methods, such as signaling pathway enrichment analysis, copynumber karyotyping analysis, and quantitative analysis of the cell proliferation rate. We also evaluated MTDM-mediated alterations in the immune microenvironment using immune microenvironment, microsatellite instability, mutation, unsupervised clustering, malignant cell subtype differentiation, immune cell subtype differentiation, and cell-communication signature analyses. Finally, we performed cellular experiments to validate the role of the MTDM-associated prognostic geneNCAPD3in BC.In this study, MTDM-associated prognostic models divided BC patients into high/low MTDM groups in TCGA/GEO datasets. The difference in survival time between the two groups was statistically significant (P<0.001). We found that high MTDM status was positively correlated with tumor cell proliferation. We analyzed the immune microenvironment and found that low-MTDM group had higher immune checkpoint gene expression/immune cell infiltration, which could lead to potential benefits from immunotherapy. In contrast, the high MTDM group had higher proliferation rates and levels of CD8+T cell exhaustion, which may be related to the secretion of GDF15 by malignant breast epithelial cells with a high MTDM status. Cellular experiments validated the role of the MTDM-associated prognostic gene NCAPD3 (the gene most positively correlated with epithelial malignant cell proliferation in the model) in BC. Knockdown of NCAPD3 significantly reduced the activity and proliferation of MDA-MB-231 and BCAP-37 cells, and significantly reduced their migration ability of BCAP-37 cell line.This study presented a holistic evaluation of the multifaceted roles of MTDM in BC. The analysis of MTDM levels not only enables the prediction of response to immunotherapy but also serves as an accurate prognostic indicator for patients with BC. These insightful discoveries provide novel perspectives on tumor immunity and have the potentially to revolutionize the diagnosis and treatment of BC.Copyright © 2023 Ma, Du, Chen, Gao, Wang, Mi, Wei and Zhao."
"37433768","Role of neuroinflammation in neurodegeneration development.","Signal Transduct Target Ther","Studies in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and so on, have suggested that inflammation is not only a result of neurodegeneration but also a crucial player in this process. Protein aggregates which are very common pathological phenomenon in neurodegeneration can induce neuroinflammation which further aggravates protein aggregation and neurodegeneration. Actually, inflammation even happens earlier than protein aggregation. Neuroinflammation induced by genetic variations in CNS cells or by peripheral immune cells may induce protein deposition in some susceptible population. Numerous signaling pathways and a range of CNS cells have been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration, although they are still far from being completely understood. Due to the limited success of traditional treatment methods, blocking or enhancing inflammatory signaling pathways involved in neurodegeneration are considered to be promising strategies for the therapy of neurodegenerative diseases, and many of them have got exciting results in animal models or clinical trials. Some of them, although very few, have been approved by FDA for clinical usage. Here we comprehensively review the factors affecting neuroinflammation and the major inflammatory signaling pathways involved in the pathogenicity of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We also summarize the current strategies, both in animal models and in the clinic, for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37509325","Comprehensive Analysis and Drug Modulation of Human Endogenous Retrovirus in Hepatocellular Carcinomas.","Cancers (Basel)","Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) play an important role in the development of cancer and many diseases. Here, we comprehensively explored the impact of HERVs on hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs).We employed Telescope to identify HERVs and quantify their expression in the total RNA sequencing data obtained from 254 HCC samples, comprising 254 tumor tissues and 34 matched normal tissues.In total, 3357 locus-specific activations of HERVs were differentially expressed, and 180 were correlated with patient survival. Using these 180 HERVs for classification, we found four subgroups with survival correlation. Higher expression levels of the 180 HERVs were correlated with poorer survival, while age, AFP, some mutations, and copy and structural variants differed among subgroups. The differential expression of host genes in high expression of these 180 HERVs primarily involved the activation of pathways related to immunity and infection, lipid and atherosclerosis, MAPK and NF-kB signaling, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions. Conversely, there was a suppression of pathways associated with RNA processing, including nucleocytoplasmic transport, surveillance and ribosome biogenesis, and transcriptional misregulation in cancer pathways. Almost all genes involved in HERV activation restriction, KRAB zinc finger proteins, RNA nucleocytoplasmic transport, stemness, HLA and antigen processing and presentation, and immune checkpoints were overexpressed in cancerous tissues, and many over-expressed HERV-related nearby genes were correlated with high HERV activation and poor survival. Twenty-three immune and stromal cells showed higher expression in non-cancerous than cancerous tissues, and seven were correlated with HERV activation. Small-molecule modulation of alternative splicing (AS) altered the expression of survival-related HERVs and their activation-related genes, as well as nearby genes.Comprehensive and integrated approaches for evaluating HERV expression and their correlation with specific pathways have the potential to provide new companion diagnostics and therapeutic strategies for HCC."

Sex-specific mechanisms such as mosaic loss of the Y chromosome in men have been linked to cardiovascular health. In women, X-linked mechanisms such as X chromosome inactivation (XCI) skewing is common in several tissues. Yet, information on the role of XCI in female atherosclerotic plaques is lacking. Here, we investigated the presence of XCI skewing in advanced atherosclerotic lesions and its association with cardiovascular risk factors, histological plaque data, and clinical data.XCI skewing was quantified in 154 atherosclerotic plaque and 55 blood DNA samples of women included in the Athero-Express study. The skewing status was determined performing the HUMARA assay. Then, we studied the relationship of XCI skewing in female plaque and cardiovascular risk factors using regression models. In addition, we studied if plaque XCI predicted plaque composition, and adverse events during 3-years follow-up using Cox proportional hazard models.XCI skewing was detected in 76 of 154 (49.4%) plaques and in 27 of 55 (67%) blood samples. None of the clinical risk factors were associated with plaque skewing. Plaque skewing was more often detected in plaques with a plaque hemorrhage (OR [95% CI]: 1.44 [1.06-1.98], P = 0.02). Moreover, skewed plaques were not associated with a higher incidence of composite and major events but were specifically associated with peripheral artery events during a 3-year follow-up period in a multivariate model (HR [95%CI]: 1.46 [1.09-1.97]; P = 0.007).XCI skewing is common in carotid plaques of females and is predictive for the occurrence of peripheral artery events within 3 years after carotid endarterectomy.© 2023.

"37488646","Circulating macrophages as the mechanistic link between mosaic loss of Y-chromosome and cardiac disease.","Cell Biosci","Genetics evidences have long linked mosaic loss of Y-chromosome (mLOY) in peripheral leukocytes with a wide range of male age-associated diseases. However, a lack of cellular and molecular mechanistic explanations for this link has limited further investigation into the relationship between mLOY and male age-related disease. Excitingly, Sano et al. have provided the first piece of evidence directly linking mLOY to cardiac fibrosis through mLOY enriched profibrotic transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) regulons in hematopoietic macrophages along with suppressed interleukin-1β (IL-1β) proinflammatory regulons. The results of this novel finding can be extrapolated to other disease related to mLOY, such as cancer, cardiac disease, and age-related macular degeneration.Sano et al. used a CRISPR-Cas9 gRNAs gene editing induced Y-chromosome ablation mouse model to assess results of a UK biobank prospective analysis implicating the Y-chromosome in male age-related disease. Using this in vivo model, Sano et al. showed that hematopoietic mLOY accelerated cardiac fibrosis and heart failure in male mice through profibrotic pathways. This process was linked to monocyte-macrophage differentiation during hematopoietic development. Mice confirmed to have mLOY in leukocytes, by loss of Y-chromosome genes Kdm5d, Uty, Eif2s3y, and Ddx3y, at similar percentages to the human population were shown to have accelerated rates of interstitial and perivascular fibrosis and abnormal echocardiograms. These mice also recovered poorly from the transverse aortic constriction (TAC) model of heart failure and developed left ventricular dysfunction at higher rates. This was attributed to aberrant proliferation of cardiac MEF-SK4 + fibroblasts promoted by mLOY macrophages enriched in profibrotic regulons and lacking in proinflammatory regulons. These pro-fibrotic macrophages localized to heart and eventually resulted in cardiac fibrosis via enhanced TGF-β1 and suppressed IL-1β signaling. Furthermore, treatment of mLOY mice with TGFβ1 neutralizing antibody was able to improve their cardiac function. This study by Sano et al. was able to provide a causative link between the known association between mLOY and male cardiac disease morbidity and mortality for the first time, and thereby provide a new target for improving human health.Using a CRISPR-Cas9 induced Y-chromosome ablation mouse model, Sano et al. has proven mosaic loss of Y-chromosome in peripheral myeloid cells to have a causative effect on male mobility and mortality due to male age-related cardiac disease. They traced the mechanism of this effect to hyper-expression of the profibrotic TGF-β1 and reduced pro-inflammatory IL-1β signaling, attenuation of which could provide another potential strategy in improving outcomes against age-related diseases in men.© 2023.

We show that amphioxus (Branchiostoma japonicum) ADAT2 (BjADAT2) contains the active site 'HxE-PCxxC' and the key residues for target-base-binding, and amphioxus ADAT3 (BjADAT3) harbors both the N-terminal positively charged region and the C-terminal pseudo-catalytic domain important for recognition of substrates. The sequencing of BjADAT2-transformed Escherichia coli genome suggests that BjADAT2 has the potential to target E. coli DNA and can deaminate at TCG and GAA sites in the E. coli genome. Biochemical analyses further demonstrate that BjADAT2, in complex with BjADAT3, can perform A-to-I editing of tRNA and convert C-to-U and A-to-I deamination of DNA. We also show that BjADAT2 preferentially deaminates adenosines and cytidines in the loop of DNA hairpin structures of substrates, and BjADAT3 also affects the type of DNA substrate targeted by BjADAT2. Finally, we find that C89, N113, C148 and Y156 play critical roles in the DNA editing activity of BjADAT2. Collectively, our study indicates that BjADAT2/3 is the sole naturally occurring deaminase with both tRNA and DNA editing capacity identified so far in Metazoa.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37455971","The predisposition of smokers to COVID-19 infection: A mini-review of global perspectives.","Heliyon","Both SARS-CoV-2 and smoking tobacco adversely impact the respiratory system, damaging the airways and impairing lung function. While some studies have identified a positive association between smoking and increased susceptibility to COVID-19 infections, a few papers have concluded that smokers may be protected against such infections. Given these contradictory findings, there is an ongoing debate in the scientific community about whether or not smokers have a stronger predisposition towards COVID-19 infections. Through this mini-review, we aimed to study the relationship between tobacco smoking and COVID-19 infections by conducting a comprehensive literature search of peer reviewed articles that reported on the effects of smoking on COVID-19 susceptibility and were published globally over the past two years (January 2020-April 2022). Our search identified 31 articles that demonstrated a positive or strong relationship between smoking and COVID-19, while 13 articles had contrasting results. Additionally, we evaluated mechanistic studies suggesting that, among smokers, angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 genes are upregulated, facilitating easier binding of SARS-CoV-2, thereby increasing the risk of COVID-19 infection. In conclusion, the majority of studies in this area to date provide evidence of a strong relationship between smoking and COVID-19 infection; however, the strength of this association may vary across the smoking behaviors of differing populations. Future work could involve a meta-analysis of studies focusing on susceptibility to COVID-19 infection for different types of tobacco product smokers, which would result in a more comprehensive understanding of the predisposition of smokers towards COVID-19 infections."

However, the published literature comparing PDTO response to clinical outcome does not include CAFs in the models. Here, a co-culture model was created using PDTOs and CAFs derived from endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle biopsies (EUS-FNBs) for potential use in drug screening applications. Co-cultures were established, and growth was compared to monocultures using image metrics and a commercially available assay. We were able to establish and expand validated malignant PDTOs from 19.2% of adenocarcinomas from EUS-FNBs. CAFs could be established from 25% of the samples. The viability of PDTOs in the mixed cell co-culture could be isolated using image metrics. The addition of CAFs promoted PDTO growth in half of the established co-cultures. These results show that co-cultures can be established from tiny amounts of tissue provided by EUS-FNB. An increased growth of PDTOs was shown in co-cultures, suggesting that the present setup successfully models CAF-PDTO interaction. Furthermore, we demonstrated that standard validation techniques may be insufficient to detect contamination with normal cells in PDTO cultures established from primary tumor core biopsies."

PRKRA is involved in cellular stress response, but its role in PC was unknown.The expression of PRKRA between normal and tumor tissues were compared, and the prognostic value of PRKRA was evaluated. SiRNA and plasmids were applied to investigate the effects of PRKRA on PC cells. Organoids and cell lines with knockout and overexpression of PRKRA were established by CRISPR/Cas9 and lentivirus. The effects of PRKRA on PC were evaluated in vivo by cell-derived xenografts. The downstream genes of PRKRA were screened by transcriptome sequencing. The regulation of the target gene was validated by RT-qPCR, western blot, ChIP and dual luciferase reporter assay. Besides, the correlation between PRKRA and gemcitabine sensitivity was investigated by PC organoids.PRKRA was significantly overexpressed in PC tissues and independently associated with poor prognosis. PRKRA promoted the proliferation, migration, and chemoresistance of PC cells. The proliferation of PC organoids was decreased by PRKRA knockout. The growth and chemoresistance of xenografts were increased by PRKRA overexpression. Mechanistically, PRKRA upregulated the transcription of MMP1 via NF-κB pathway. ChIP and dual luciferase reporter assay showed that NF-κB subunit P65 could bind to the promoter of MMP1. The sensitivity of PC organoids to gemcitabine was negatively correlated with the expression of PRKRA and MMP1.Our study indicated that the PRKRA/NF-κB/MMP1 axis promoted the progression of PC and may serve as a potential therapeutic target and prognosis marker.© 2023 The Authors."

A number of HERVs are correlated with the expression of dysregulated genes in Alzheimer's and are physically proximal to genes which drive disease pathways.Dysregulated expression of ancient retroviral insertions in the human genome are present in Alzheimer's disease and show localization patterns that may explain how these elements drive pathogenic gene expression.Copyright © 2023 Dawson, Rentia, Sanford, Cruchaga, Kauwe and Crandall."
"37308596","H4K16ac activates the transcription of transposable elements and contributes to their cis-regulatory function.","Nat Struct Mol Biol","Mammalian genomes harbor abundant transposable elements (TEs) and their remnants, with numerous epigenetic repression mechanisms enacted to silence TE transcription. However, TEs are upregulated during early development, neuronal lineage, and cancers, although the epigenetic factors contributing to the transcription of TEs have yet to be fully elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that the male-specific lethal (MSL)-complex-mediated histone H4 acetylation at lysine 16 (H4K16ac) is enriched at TEs in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and cancer cells. This in turn activates transcription of subsets of full-length long interspersed nuclear elements (LINE1s, L1s) and endogenous retrovirus (ERV) long terminal repeats (LTRs). Furthermore, we show that the H4K16ac-marked L1 and LTR subfamilies display enhancer-like functions and are enriched in genomic locations with chromatin features associated with active enhancers. Importantly, such regions often reside at boundaries of topologically associated domains and loop with genes. CRISPR-based epigenetic perturbation and genetic deletion of L1s reveal that H4K16ac-marked L1s and LTRs regulate the expression of genes in cis. Overall, TEs enriched with H4K16ac contribute to the cis-regulatory landscape at specific genomic locations by maintaining an active chromatin landscape at TEs.© 2023. The Author(s)."

A simple and reliable blood screening test applied routinely would therefore address a major unmet medical need. To gain insight into the value of protein biomarkers in early detection and stratification of cancer we determined the time course of changes in the plasma proteome of mice carrying transplanted human lung, breast, colon, or ovarian tumors. For protein measurements we used an aptamer-based assay which simultaneously measures ~ 5000 proteins. Along with tumor lineage-specific biomarkers, we also found 15 markers shared among all cancer types that included the energy metabolism enzymes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phophate isomerase and dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase as well as several important biomarkers for maintaining protein, lipid, nucleotide, or carbohydrate balance such as tryptophanyl t-RNA synthetase and nucleoside diphosphate kinase. Using significantly altered proteins in the tumor bearing mice, we developed models to stratify tumor types and to estimate the minimum detectable tumor volume.

"37456144","Comparative predictive power of serum vs plasma proteomic signatures in feto-maternal medicine.","AJOG Glob Rep","Blood proteins are frequently measured in serum or plasma, because they provide a wealth of information. Differences in the ex vivo processing of serum and plasma raise concerns that proteomic health and disease signatures derived from serum or plasma differ in content and quality. However, little is known about their respective power to predict feto-maternal health outcomes. Predictive power is a sentinel characteristic to determine the clinical use of biosignatures.This study aimed to compare the power of serum and plasma proteomic signatures to predict a physiological pregnancy outcome.Paired serum and plasma samples from 73 women were obtained from biorepositories of a multinational prospective cohort study on pregnancy outcomes. Gestational age at the time of sampling was the predicted outcome, because the proteomic signatures have been validated for such a prediction. Multivariate and cross-validated models were independently derived for serum and plasma proteins.A total of 1116 proteins were measured in 88 paired samples from 73 women with a highly multiplexed platform using proximity extension technology (Olink Proteomics Inc, Watertown, MA). The plasma proteomic signature showed a higher predictive power (R=0.64; confidence interval, 0.42-0.79;P=3.5×10-6) than the serum signature (R=0.45; confidence interval, 0.18-0.66;P=2.2×10-3). The serum signature was validated in plasma with a similar predictive power (R=0.58; confidence interval, 0.34-0.75;P=4.8×10-5), whereas the plasma signature was validated in serum with reduced predictive power (R=0.53; confidence interval, 0.27-0.72;P=2.6×10-4). Signature proteins largely overlapped in the serum and plasma, but the strength of association with gestational age was weaker for serum proteins.Findings suggest that serum proteomics are less informative than plasma proteomics. They are compatible with the view that the partial ex-vivo degradation and modification of serum proteins during sample processing are an underlying reason. The rationale for collecting and analyzing serum and plasma samples should be carefully considered when deriving proteomic biosignatures to ascertain that specimens of the highest scientific and clinical yield are processed. Findings suggest that plasma is the preferred matrix.© 2023 The Authors."

We further validated AECs derived gene-signature in BECs (AUC = 0.72), ASM (AUC = 0.74) and WB (AUC = 0.66). Similarly, NECs derived gene-signature were validated in BECs (AUC = 0.75), ASM (AUC = 0.82) and WB (AUC = 0.69). Both AECs and NECs based gene-signatures showed a strong diagnostic performance with high sensitivity and specificity. Functional annotation of gene-signatures from AECs and NECs were enriched in pathways associated with IL-13, PI3K/AKT and apoptosis signaling. Several asthma related genes were prioritized including SERPINB2 and CTSC genes, which showed functional relevance in multiple tissue/cell types and related to asthma pathogenesis.

The survival disparity is particularly striking among (estrogen receptor positive) ER+breast cancer cases. The purpose of this study is to examine whether there are racial differences in metabolic pathways typically activated in patients with ER+breast cancer. We collected pretreatment plasma from AA and NHW ER+ breast cancer cases (AA n = 48, NHW n = 54) and cancer-free controls (AA n = 100, NHW n = 48) to conduct an untargeted metabolomics analysis using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to identify metabolites that may be altered in the different racial groups. Unpaired t-test combined with multiple feature selection and prediction models were employed to identify race-specific altered metabolic signatures. This was followed by the identification of altered metabolic pathways with a focus in AA patients with breast cancer. The clinical relevance of the identified pathways was further examined in PanCancer Atlas breast cancer data set from The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA). We identified differential metabolic signatures between NHW and AA patients. In AA patients, we observed decreased circulating levels of amino acids compared to healthy controls, while fatty acids were significantly higher in NHW patients. By mapping these metabolites to potential epigenetic regulatory mechanisms, this study identified significant associations with regulators of metabolism such as methionine adenosyltransferase 1A (MAT1A), DNA Methyltransferases and Histone methyltransferases for AA individuals, and Fatty acid Synthase (FASN) and Monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL) for NHW individuals. Specific gene Negative Elongation Factor Complex E (NELFE) with histone methyltransferase activity, was associated with poor survival exclusively for AA individuals. We employed a comprehensive and novel approach that integrates multiple machine learning and statistical methods, coupled with human functional pathway analyses. The metabolic profile of plasma samples identified may help elucidate underlying molecular drivers of disproportionately aggressive ER+ tumor biology in AA women. It may ultimately lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets. To our knowledge, this is a novel finding that describes a link between metabolic alterations and epigenetic regulation in AA breast cancer and underscores the need for detailed investigations into the biological underpinnings of breast cancer health disparities.© 2023.

To identify the genes pivotal for endocrine-resistance progression, we screened five datasets and found 7 commonly dysregulated genes in endocrine-resistant breast cancer cells. Here we show that downregulation of serine protease inhibitor clade A member 3 (SERPINA3) which is a direct target gene of estrogen receptor α contributes to aromatase inhibitor resistance. Ankyrin repeat domain containing 11 (ANKRD11) works as a downstream effector of SERPINA3 in mediating endocrine-resistance. It induces aromatase inhibitor insensitivity by interacting with histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) and upregulating its activity. Our study suggests that aromatase inhibitor therapy downregulates SERPINA3 and leads to the ensuing upregulation of ANKRD11, which in turn promotes aromatase inhibitor resistance via binding to and activating HDAC3. HDAC3 inhibition may reverse the aromatase inhibitor resistance in ER-positive breast cancer with decreased SERPINA3 and increased ANKRD11 expression.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37370789","Stratification of Tamoxifen Synergistic Combinations for the Treatment of ER+ Breast Cancer.","Cancers (Basel)","Breast cancer alone accounts for the majority of cancer deaths among women, with the most commonly diagnosed subtype being estrogen receptor positive (ER+). Survival has greatly improved for patients with ER+ breast cancer, due in part to the development of antiestrogen compounds, such as tamoxifen. While treatment of the primary disease is often successful, as many as 30% of patients will experience recurrence and metastasis, mainly due to developed endocrine therapy resistance. In this study, we discovered two tamoxifen combination therapies, with simeprevir and VX-680, that reduce the tumor burden in animal models of ER+ breast cancer more than either compound or tamoxifen alone. Additionally, these tamoxifen combinations reduced the expression of HER2, a hallmark of tamoxifen treatment, which can facilitate acquisition of a treatment-resistant phenotype. These combinations could provide clinical benefit by potentiating tamoxifen treatment in ER+ breast cancer."

The immune-mediated mechanisms that promulgate the demyelinating lesions during relapses of acute episodes are not characteristic of chronic lesions during progressive MS. This has limited our capacity to target the disease effectively as it evolves within the central nervous system white and gray matter, thereby leaving neurologists without effective options to manage individuals as they transition to a secondary progressive phase. The current review highlights the molecular and cellular sequelae that have been identified as cooperating with and/or contributing to neurodegeneration that characterizes individuals with progressive forms of MS. We emphasize the need for appropriate monitoring via known and novel molecular and imaging biomarkers that can accurately detect and predict progression for the purposes of newly designed clinical trials that can demonstrate the efficacy of neuroprotection and potentially neurorepair.

However, little is known about the direct interaction between these cells when they are in close proximity in the inflamed CNS. By using an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS, we previously found that in the proximity of autoreactive CNS-infiltrated immune cells (CNS-IICs), astrocytes respond with a rapid calcium increase that is mediated by the autocrine P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) activation. We now reveal that the mechanisms regulating this direct interaction of astrocytes and CNS-IICs involve the coupling between P2X7R, connexin-43, and β3-integrin. We found that P2X7R and astroglial connexin-43 interact and concentrate in the immediate proximity of the CNS-IICs in EAE. P2X7R also interacts with β3-integrin, and the block of astroglial αvβ3-integrin reduces the P2X7R-dependent calcium response of astrocytes upon encountering CNS-IICs. This interaction was dependent on astroglial mitochondrial activity, which regulated the ATP-driven P2X7R activation and facilitated the termination of the astrocytic calcium response evoked by CNS-IICs. By further defining the interactions between the CNS and the immune system, our findings provide a novel perspective toward expanding integrin-targeting therapeutic approaches for MS treatment by controlling the cell-cell interactions between astrocytes and CNS-IICs."
"37410268","Neuroglial components of brain lesions may provide new therapeutic strategies for multiple sclerosis.","Neurol Sci","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune and demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) which leads to focal demyelinated lesions in the brain and spinal cord. Failure of remyelination contributes to chronic disability in young adults. Characterization of events occurring during the demyelination and remyelination processes and those of which subsequently limit remyelination or contribute to demyelination can provide the possibility of new therapies development for MS. Most of the currently available therapies and investigations modulate immune responses and mediators. Since most therapeutic strategies have unsatisfied outcomes, developing new therapies that enhance brain lesion repair is a priority. A close look at cellular and chemical components of MS lesions will pave the way to a better understanding of lesions pathology and will provide possible opportunities for repair strategies and targeted pharmacotherapy. This review summarizes the lesion components and features, particularly the detrimental elements, and discusses the possibility of suggesting new potential targets as therapies for demyelinating diseases like MS.© 2023.

"37465119","The central role of DNA damage in immunosenescence.","Front Aging","Ageing is the biggest risk factor for the development of multiple chronic diseases as well as increased infection susceptibility and severity of diseases such as influenza and COVID-19. This increased disease risk is linked to changes in immune function during ageing termed immunosenescence. Age-related loss of immune function, particularly in adaptive responses against pathogens and immunosurveillance against cancer, is accompanied by a paradoxical gain of function of some aspects of immunity such as elevated inflammation and increased incidence of autoimmunity. Of the many factors that contribute to immunosenescence, DNA damage is emerging as a key candidate. In this review, we discuss the evidence supporting the hypothesis that DNA damage may be a central driver of immunosenescence through senescence of both immune cells and cells of non-haematopoietic lineages. We explore why DNA damage accumulates during ageing in a major cell type, T cells, and how this may drive age-related immune dysfunction. We further propose that existing immunosenescence interventions may act, at least in part, by mitigating DNA damage and restoring DNA repair processes (which we term ""genoprotection""). As such, we propose additional treatments on the basis of their evidence for genoprotection, and further suggest that this approach may provide a viable therapeutic strategy for improving immunity in older people.Copyright © 2023 Kell, Simon, Alsaleh and Cox."
"37524865","Reversing pancreatic Î²-cell dedifferentiation in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.","Exp Mol Med","The maintenance of glucose homeostasis is fundamental for survival and health. Diabetes develops when glucose homeostasis fails. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is characterized by insulin resistance and pancreatic β-cell failure. The failure of β-cells to compensate for insulin resistance results in hyperglycemia, which in turn drives altered lipid metabolism and β-cell failure. Thus, insulin secretion by pancreatic β-cells is a primary component of glucose homeostasis. Impaired β-cell function and reduced β-cell mass are found in diabetes. Both features stem from a failure to maintain β-cell identity, which causes β-cells to dedifferentiate into nonfunctional endocrine progenitor-like cells or to trans-differentiate into other endocrine cell types. In this regard, one of the key issues in achieving disease modification is how to reestablish β-cell identity. In this review, we focus on the causes and implications of β-cell failure, as well as its potential reversibility as a T2D treatment.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37481581","A universal tool for predicting differentially active features in single-cell and spatial genomics data.","Sci Rep","With the growing complexity of single-cell and spatial genomics data, there is an increasing importance of unbiased and efficient exploratory data analysis tools. One common exploratory data analysis step is the prediction of genes with different levels of activity in a subset of cells or locations inside a tissue. We previously developed singleCellHaystack, a method for predicting differentially expressed genes from single-cell transcriptome data, without relying on comparisons between clusters of cells. Here we present an update to singleCellHaystack, which is now a universally applicable method for predicting differentially active features: (1) singleCellHaystack now accepts continuous features that can be RNA or protein expression, chromatin accessibility or module scores from single-cell, spatial and even bulk genomics data, and (2) it can handle 1D trajectories, 2-3D spatial coordinates, as well as higher-dimensional latent spaces as input coordinates. Performance has been drastically improved, with up to ten times reduction in computational time and scalability to millions of cells, making singleCellHaystack a suitable tool for exploratory analysis of atlas level datasets. singleCellHaystack is available as packages in both R and Python.© 2023.

Despite the great advances in the development of computational methods for various steps of scRNA-seq analyses, one major bottleneck of the existing technologies remains in identifying the molecular relationship between disease phenotype and cell subpopulations, where ""disease phenotype"" refers to the clinical characteristics of each patient sample, and subpopulation refer to groups of single cells, which often do not correspond to clusters identified by standard single-cell clustering analysis. Here, we present PACSI, a method aimed at distinguishing cell subpopulations associated with disease phenotypes at the single-cell level.PACSI takes advantage of the topological properties of biological networks to introduce a proximity-based measure that quantifies the correlation between each cell and the disease phenotype of interest. Applied to simulated data and four case studies, PACSI accurately identified cells associated with disease phenotypes such as diagnosis, prognosis, and response to immunotherapy. In addition, we demonstrated that PACSI can also be applied to spatial transcriptomics data and successfully label spots that are associated with poor survival of breast carcinoma.PACSI is an efficient method to identify cell subpopulations associated with disease phenotypes. Our research shows that it has a broad range of applications in revealing mechanistic and clinical insights of diseases.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Here, we describe M ulti Mo dal C lassifier Hi erarchy (MMoCHi), a marker-based approach for classification, reconciling gene and protein expression without reliance on reference atlases. We benchmark MMoCHi using sorted T lymphocyte subsets and annotate a cross-tissue human immune cell dataset. MMoCHi outperforms leading transcriptome-based classifiers and multimodal unsupervised clustering in its ability to identify immune cell subsets that are not readily resolved and to reveal novel subset markers. MMoCHi is designed for adaptability and can integrate CITE-seq annotation of cell types and developmental states across diverse lineages, tissues, or individuals."

"37447838","Recent Approaches to Design and Analysis of Electrical Impedance Systems for Single Cells Using Machine Learning.","Sensors (Basel)","Individual cells have many unique properties that can be quantified to develop a holistic understanding of a population. This can include understanding population characteristics, identifying subpopulations, or elucidating outlier characteristics that may be indicators of disease. Electrical impedance measurements are rapid and label-free for the monitoring of single cells and generate large datasets of many cells at single or multiple frequencies. To increase the accuracy and sensitivity of measurements and define the relationships between impedance and biological features, many electrical measurement systems have incorporated machine learning (ML) paradigms for control and analysis. Considering the difficulty capturing complex relationships using traditional modelling and statistical methods due to population heterogeneity, ML offers an exciting approach to the systemic collection and analysis of electrical properties in a data-driven way. In this work, we discuss incorporation of ML to improve the field of electrical single cell analysis by addressing the design challenges to manipulate single cells and sophisticated analysis of electrical properties that distinguish cellular changes. Looking forward, we emphasize the opportunity to build on integrated systems to address common challenges in data quality and generalizability to save time and resources at every step in electrical measurement of single cells."
"37379341","Cell-type annotation with accurate unseen cell-type identification using multiple references.","PLoS Comput Biol","The recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) techniques have stimulated efforts to identify and characterize the cellular composition of complex tissues. With the advent of various sequencing techniques, automated cell-type annotation using a well-annotated scRNA-seq reference becomes popular. But it relies on the diversity of cell types in the reference, which may not capture all the cell types present in the query data of interest. There are generally unseen cell types in the query data of interest because most data atlases are obtained for different purposes and techniques. Identifying previously unseen cell types is essential for improving annotation accuracy and uncovering novel biological discoveries. To address this challenge, we propose mtANN (multiple-reference-based scRNA-seq data annotation), a new method to automatically annotate query data while accurately identifying unseen cell types with the aid of multiple references. Key innovations of mtANN include the integration of deep learning and ensemble learning to improve prediction accuracy, and the introduction of a new metric that considers three complementary aspects to distinguish between unseen cell types and shared cell types. Additionally, we provide a data-driven method to adaptively select a threshold for identifying previously unseen cell types. We demonstrate the advantages of mtANN over state-of-the-art methods for unseen cell-type identification and cell-type annotation on two benchmark dataset collections, as well as its predictive power on a collection of COVID-19 datasets.

"37432338","Molecular Oxygen Levels and Percentages of DNA Damage in TPN Patients.","Nutrients","Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is a life-saving therapy for patients with intestinal failure, but it carries the risk of complications, including an increase in liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) after long-term use. Patients receiving chronic TPN are also exposed to metabolic stress from both the underlying disease and parenteral nutrition. The aim of this study was to compare the concentration of liver transaminases AST and ALT in relation to the rate of oxygen consumption in platelet mitochondria in patients receiving long-term TPN with the degree of oxidative stress induced by lipid emulsions, and to explain their role in cellular energy metabolism and changes in the liver based on the percentage of genomic DNA damage. The study group consisted of 86 TPN patients, while the control group consisted of 86 healthy volunteers who were fed only orally. The results of the study showed that the percentage of molecular oxygen depended on the type of lipid emulsion supplied. Analyzing time on TPN as a factor, we observed a decrease in percentage genomic DNA damage and an increase in percentage molecular oxygen in cells. It remains unclear whether TPN has a direct effect on genomic DNA damage and the level of molecular oxygen in cells during the course of treatment. In conclusion, this study provides important insights into the potential effects of TPN on liver enzymes and cellular metabolism. Further research is needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms and to develop strategies to minimize the risk of complications associated with TPN."
"37306474","Nutrition and autophagy deficiency in critical illness.","Curr Opin Crit Care","Critical illness imposes a severe insult on the body, with various stressors triggering pronounced cell damage. This compromises cellular function, leading to a high risk of multiple organ failure. Autophagy can remove damaged molecules and organelles but appears insufficiently activated during critical illness. This review discusses insight into the role of autophagy in critical illness and the involvement of artificial feeding in insufficient autophagy activation in critical illness.Animal studies manipulating autophagy have shown its protective effects against kidney, lung, liver, and intestinal injury after several critical insults. Autophagy activation also protected peripheral, respiratory, and cardiac muscle function, despite aggravated muscle atrophy. Its role in acute brain injury is more equivocal. Animal and patient studies showed that artificial feeding suppressed autophagy activation in critical illness, particularly with high protein/amino acid doses. Feeding-suppressed autophagy may explain short and long-term harm by early enhanced calorie/protein feeding in large randomized controlled trials.Insufficient autophagy during critical illness is at least partly explained by feeding-induced suppression. This may explain why early enhanced nutrition failed to benefit critically ill patients or even induced harm. Safe, specific activation of autophagy avoiding prolonged starvation opens perspectives for improving outcomes of critical illness.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

The main treatment options are laparoscopic (LS) and open surgery (OS), which might differ in their impact on the cellular immunity so indispensable for anti-infectious and antitumor defense. MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science (SCI-EXPANDED), the Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, ClinicalTrials.gov, and ICTRP (WHO) were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing cellular immunity in CRC patients of any stage between minimally invasive and open surgical resections. A random effects-weighted inverse variance meta-analysis was performed for cell counts of natural killer (NK) cells, white blood cells (WBCs), lymphocytes, CD4+ T cells, and the CD4+/CD8+ ratio. The RoB2 tool was used to assess the risk of bias. The meta-analysis was prospectively registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021264324). A total of 14 trials including 974 participants were assessed. The LS groups showed more favorable outcomes in eight trials, with lower inflammation and less immunosuppression as indicated by higher innate and adaptive cell counts, higher NK cell activity, and higher HLA-DR expression rates compared to OS, with only one study reporting lower WBCs after OS. The meta-analysis yielded significantly higher NK cell counts at postoperative day (POD)4 (weighted mean difference (WMD) 30.80 cells/µL [19.68; 41.92],p <0.00001) and POD6-8 (WMD 45.08 cells/µL [35.95; 54.21],p <0.00001). Although further research is required, LS is possibly associated with less suppression of cellular immunity and lower inflammation, indicating better preservation of cellular immunity."
"37462886","Identification of Novel Diagnostic Biomarkers and Classification Patterns for Osteoarthritis by Analyzing a Specific Set of Genes Related to Inflammation.","Inflammation","Osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent joint disease globally. TNFA is recognized as a crucial inflammatory cytokine that plays a significant role in the pathophysiological mechanisms that occur during the progression of OA. However, the TNFA_SIGNALING_VIA_NFKB (TSVN)-related genes (TRGs) during the progression of OA remain unclear. By conducting a combinatory analysis of OA transcriptome data from three datasets, various differentially expressed TRGs were identified. The logistic regression model was used to mine hub TRGs for OA, and a nomogram prediction model was subsequently constructed using these TRGs. To identify new molecular subgroups, we performed consensus clustering. We then conducted functional analyses, including GO, KEGG, GSVA, and GSEA, to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. To determine the immune microenvironment, we applied xCell. The logistic regression analysis identified three hub TRGs (BHLHE40, BTG2, and CCNL1) as potential biomarkers for OA. Based on these TRGs, we constructed an OA predictive model. This model has demonstrated promising results in enhancing the accuracy of OA diagnosis, as evident from the ROC analysis (AUC merged dataset = 0.937, AUC validating dataset = 0.924). We identified two molecular subtypes, C1 and C2, and found that the C1 subtype showed activation of immune- and inflammation-related pathways. The involvement of TSVN in the development and progression of OA has been established. We identified several hub genes, such as BHLHE40, BTG2, and CCNL1, that may have a significant association with the progression of OA. Furthermore, our logistic regression model based on these genes has shown promising results in accurately diagnosing OA patients.© 2023.

Preliminary studies suggest that these associations may begin already in utero. Here, we study the longitudinal associations of prenatal psychosocial stress with sleep across childhood, and assess whether prenatal stress interacts with genetic liability for poor sleep.The study is embedded in the Generation R population-based birth cohort. Caregivers reported on prenatal psychosocial stress (life events, contextual, parental or interpersonal stressors) and on children's sleep at ages 2 months, 1.5, 2, 3 and 6 years. The study sample consisted of 4,930 children; polygenic risk scores for sleep traits were available in 2,063.Prenatal stress was consistently associated with more sleep problems across assessments. Effect sizes ranged from small (B = 0.21, 95%CI: 0.14;0.27) at 2 months to medium (B = 0.45, 95%CI: 0.38;0.53) at 2 years. Prenatal stress was moreover associated with shorter sleep duration at 2 months (Bhrs = -0.22, 95%CI: -0.32;-0.12) and at 2 years (Bhrs = -0.04, 95%CI -0.07; -0.001), but not at 3 years (Bhrs = 0.02, 95%CI: -0.02;0.06). Prenatal negative life events interacted with polygenic risk for insomnia to exacerbate sleep problems at 6 years (Binteraction = 0.07, 95%CI: 0.02;0.13).Psychosocial stress during pregnancy has negative associations with children's sleep that persist across childhood, and are exacerbated by genetic liability for insomnia. Associations with sleep duration were more pronounced in infancy and seem to attenuate with age. These findings highlight the role of the prenatal environment for developing sleep regulation, and could inform early intervention programs targeting sleep in children from high-risk pregnancies.© 2023.

Here, we describe SComatic, an algorithm designed for the detection of somatic mutations in single-cell transcriptomic and ATAC-seq (assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequence) data sets directly without requiring matched bulk or single-cell DNA sequencing data. SComatic distinguishes somatic mutations from polymorphisms, RNA-editing events and artefacts using filters and statistical tests parameterized on non-neoplastic samples. Using >2.6 million single cells from 688 single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) data sets spanning cancer and non-neoplastic samples, we show that SComatic detects mutations in single cells accurately, even in differentiated cells from polyclonal tissues that are not amenable to mutation detection using existing methods. Validated against matched genome sequencing and scRNA-seq data, SComatic achieves F1 scores between 0.6 and 0.7 across diverse data sets, in comparison to 0.2-0.4 for the second-best performing method. In summary, SComatic permits de novo mutational signature analysis, and the study of clonal heterogeneity and mutational burdens at single-cell resolution.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Toxicant-associated NAFLD, also known as toxicant-associated fatty liver disease (TAFLD), consists of a spectrum of disorders ranging from steatosis and steatohepatitis to fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Previously, our group demonstrated that 12-week exposure to the PCB mixture, Aroclor 1260, exacerbated steatohepatitis in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice; however, the longer-term effects of PCBs on TAFLD remain to be elucidated. This study aims to examine the longer-term effects of Aroclor 1260 (>30 weeks) in a diet-induced obesity model to better understand how duration of exposure can impact TAFLD.Male C57BL/6 mice were exposed to Aroclor 1260 (20 mg/kg) or vehicle control by oral gavage at the beginning of the study period and fed either a low-fat diet (LFD) or HFD throughout the study period.Aroclor 1260 exposure (>30 weeks) led to steatohepatitis only in LFD-fed mice. Several Aroclor 1260 exposed LFD-fed mice also developed hepatocellular carcinoma (25%), which was absent in HFD-fed mice. The LFD+Aroclor1260 group also exhibited decreased hepaticCyp7a1expression and increased pro-fibroticActa2expression. In contrast, longer term Aroclor 1260 exposure in conjunction with HFD did not exacerbate steatosis or inflammatory responses beyond those observed with HFD alone. Further, hepatic xenobiotic receptor activation by Aroclor 1260 was absent at 31 weeks post exposure, suggesting PCB redistribution to the adipose and other extra-hepatic tissues with time.Overall, the results demonstrated that longer-term PCB exposure worsened TAFLD outcomes independent of HFD feeding and suggests altered energy metabolism as a potential mechanism fueling PCB mediated toxicity without dietary insult. Additional research exploring mechanisms for these longer-term PCB mediated toxicity in TAFLD is warranted."

Oxidative stress and inflammation related to hyperglycemia are interlinked and contribute to the occurrence of DKD. It was shown that sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, a novel yet already widely used therapy, may prevent the development of DKD and alter its natural progression. SGLT2 inhibitors induce systemic and glomerular hemodynamic changes, provide metabolic advantages, and reduce inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways. In T2DM patients, regardless of cardiovascular diseases, SGLT2 inhibitors may reduce albuminuria, progression of DKD, and doubling of serum creatinine levels, thus lowering the need for kidney replacement therapy by over 40%. The molecular mechanisms behind these beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibitors extend beyond their glucose-lowering effects. The emerging studies are trying to explain these mechanisms at the genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, and proteomic levels."

"37420756","Ultrasensitive Surface Plasmon Resonance Sensor with a Feature of Dynamically Tunable Sensitivity and High Figure of Merit for Cancer Detection.","Sensors (Basel)","Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and it is well known that an early detection of cancer in a human body will provide an opportunity to cure the cancer. Early detection of cancer depends on the sensitivity of the measuring device and method, where the lowest detectable concentration of the cancerous cell in a test sample becomes a matter of high importance. Recently, Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) has proven to be a promising method to detect cancerous cells. The SPR method is based on the detection of changes in refractive indices of samples under testing and the sensitivity of such a SPR based sensor is related to the smallest detectable change in the refractive index of the sample. There exist many techniques where different combinations of metals, metal alloys and different configurations have been shown to lead to high sensitivities of the SPR sensors. Based on the difference in the refractive index between a normal healthy cell and a cancerous cell, recently, SPR method has been shown to be applicable to detect different types of cancers. In this work, we propose a new sensor surface configuration that comprises of gold-silver-graphene-black phosphorus to detect different cancerous cells based on the SPR method. Additionally, recently we proposed that the application of electric field across gold-graphene layers that form the SPR sensor surface can provide enhanced sensitivity than that is possible without the application of electrical bias. We utilized the same concept and numerically studied the impact of electrical bias across the gold-graphene layers combined with silver and black Phosphorus layers which forms the SPR sensor surface. Our numerical results have shown that electrical bias across the sensor surface in this new heterostructure can provide enhanced sensitivity compared to the original unbiased sensor surface. Not only that, our results have shown that as the electrical bias increases, the sensitivity increases up to a certain value and stabilizes at a still improved sensitivity value. Such dependence of sensitivity on the applied bias provides a dynamic tunability of the sensitivity and figure-of-merit (FOM) of the sensor to detect different types of cancer. In this work, we used the proposed heterostructure to detect six different types of cancers: Basal, Hela, Jurkat, PC12, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7. Comparing our results to work published recently, we were able to achieve an enhanced sensitivity ranging from 97.2 to 1851.4 (deg/RIU) and FOM values ranging from 62.13 to 89.81 far above the values presented recently by other researchers."

Serum levels of AFP, sAXL, and DCP were determined, and APRI and GPR values were calculated. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to analyze the diagnostic value of single and combined biomarkers.We detected significant differences between the HCC group and other groups regarding serum AFP, sAXL, DCP, and APRI levels. GPR significantly differed between the HCC group and other groups, except for the liver cirrhosis group. AFP, sAXL, DCP, APRI, and GPR had positive correlations with each other, and AFP showed a higher area under the curve (AUC) and Youden index values, while APRI and DCP showed the highest sensitivity and specificity. Also, when AFP was combined with sAXL, DCP, APRI, and GRP, the highest AUC (0.911) and a higher net reclassification improvement value were obtained compared with those obtained for the individual biomarkers.AFP, sAXL, DCP, APRI, and GPR are independent risk factors for HCC, and the diagnostic performance of AFP combined with sAXL, DCP, APRI, and GPR for HCC diagnosis was superior to that of the individual biomarkers.© 2023 Authors."

Here, we present concisely the experience on the assessment of ctDNA levels and kinetics during therapy in the outcome of radiotherapy (RT) and chemo-radiotherapy (CRT) in squamous cell head-neck cancer and esophageal squamous cell cancer patients. The levels of circulating viral (human papilloma virus or Epstein-Barr) ctDNA, and levels of total, mutated or methylated ctDNA at diagnosis are linked with tumor burden and clinical aggressiveness, and may be of prognostic or even predictive value of RT/CRT efficacy.

"37474564","Enhanced performance of gene expression predictive models with protein-mediated spatial chromatin interactions.","Sci Rep","There have been multiple attempts to predict the expression of the genes based on the sequence, epigenetics, and various other factors. To improve those predictions, we have decided to investigate adding protein-specific 3D interactions that play a significant role in the condensation of the chromatin structure in the cell nucleus. To achieve this, we have used the architecture of one of the state-of-the-art algorithms, ExPecto, and investigated the changes in the model metrics upon adding the spatially relevant data. We have used ChIA-PET interactions that are mediated by cohesin (24 cell lines), CTCF (4 cell lines), and RNAPOL2 (4 cell lines). As the output of the study, we have developed the Spatial Gene Expression (SpEx) algorithm that shows statistically significant improvements in most cell lines. We have compared ourselves to the baseline ExPecto model, which obtained a 0.82 Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (SCC) score, and 0.85, which is reported by newer Enformer were able to obtain the average correlation score of 0.83. However, in some cases (e.g. RNAPOL2 on GM12878), our improvement reached 0.04, and in some cases (e.g. RNAPOL2 on H1), we reached an SCC of 0.86.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37440599","DeepChIA-PET: Accurately predicting ChIA-PET from Hi-C and ChIP-seq with deep dilated networks.","PLoS Comput Biol","Chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET) can capture genome-wide chromatin interactions mediated by a specific DNA-associated protein. The ChIA-PET experiments have been applied to explore the key roles of different protein factors in chromatin folding and transcription regulation. However, compared with widely available Hi-C and ChIP-seq data, there are not many ChIA-PET datasets available in the literature. A computational method for accurately predicting ChIA-PET interactions from Hi-C and ChIP-seq data is needed that can save the efforts of performing wet-lab experiments. Here we present DeepChIA-PET, a supervised deep learning approach that can accurately predict ChIA-PET interactions by learning the latent relationships between ChIA-PET and two widely used data types: Hi-C and ChIP-seq. We trained our deep models with CTCF-mediated ChIA-PET of GM12878 as ground truth, and the deep network contains 40 dilated residual convolutional blocks. We first showed that DeepChIA-PET with only Hi-C as input significantly outperforms Peakachu, another computational method for predicting ChIA-PET from Hi-C but using random forests. We next proved that adding ChIP-seq as one extra input does improve the classification performance of DeepChIA-PET, but Hi-C plays a more prominent role in DeepChIA-PET than ChIP-seq. Our evaluation results indicate that our learned models can accurately predict not only CTCF-mediated ChIA-ET in GM12878 and HeLa but also non-CTCF ChIA-PET interactions, including RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) ChIA-PET of GM12878, RAD21 ChIA-PET of GM12878, and RAD21 ChIA-PET of K562. In total, DeepChIA-PET is an accurate tool for predicting the ChIA-PET interactions mediated by various chromatin-associated proteins from different cell types.Copyright: © 2023 Liu, Wang.

However, Australian parents' knowledge and attitudes regarding PRS for NBS is currently unknown.Methods:Parents with at least one Australian-born child under 18 years were invited via social media platforms to complete an online questionnaire aimed at examining parents' knowledge of NCDs, PRS, and precision medicine, their opinions on receiving PRS for their child, and considerations of early-intervention strategies to prevent the onset of disease.Results:Of 126 participants, 90.5% had heard the term ""non-communicable disease or chronic condition,"" but only 31.8% and 34.4% were aware of the terms ""polygenic risk score"" and ""precision medicine"" respectively. A large proportion of participants said they would consider screening their newborn to receive a PRS for allergies (77.9%), asthma (81.0%), cancer (64.8%), cardiovascular disease (65.7%), mental illness (56.7%), obesity (49.5%), and type 2 diabetes (66.7%). Additionally, participants would primarily consider diet and exercise as interventions for specific NCDs.Discussion:The results from this study will inform future policy for genomic NBS, including expected rate of uptake and interventions that parents would consider employing to prevent the onset of disease.Copyright © 2023 Casauria, Lewis, Lynch and Saffery."

An mRNA signature predictive of prognosis and therapy response in BRCA carriers was developed according to circular RNA homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 3 (circHIPK3)-based ceRNA network.We constructed a circHIPK3-based ceRNA network based on GSE173766 dataset and identified potential mRNAs that were associated with BRCA mutation patients within this ceRNA network. A total of 11 prognostic mRNAs and a risk model were identified and developed by univariate Cox regression analysis and the LASSO regression analysis as well as stepAIC method. Genomic landscape was treated by mutect2 and fisher. Immune characteristics was analyzed by ESTIMATE, MCP-counter. TIDE analysis was conducted to predict immunotherapy. The clinical treatment outcomes of BRCA mutation patients were assessed using a nomogram. The proliferation, migration and invasion in breast cancer cell lines were examined using CCK8 assay and transwell assay.We found 241 mRNAs within the circHIPK3-based ceRNA network. An 11 mRNA-based signature was identified for prognostic model construction. High risk patients exhibited dismal prognosis, low response to immunotherapy, less immune cell infiltration and tumor mutation burden (TMB). High-risk patients were sensitive to six anti-tumor drugs, while low-risk patient were sensitive to 47 drugs. The risk score was the most effective on evaluating patients' survival. The robustness and good prediction performance were validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset and immunotherapy datasets, respectively. In addition, circHIPK3 mRNA level was upregulated, and promoted cell viability, migration and invasion in breast cancer cell lines.The current study could improve the understanding of mRNAs in relation to BRCA mutation and pave the way to develop mRNA-based therapeutic targets for breast cancer patients with BRCA mutation.©2023 Lian et al."
"37415206","Prenatal delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol exposure is associated with changes in rhesus macaque DNA methylation enriched for autism genes.","Clin Epigenetics","With the growing availability of cannabis and the popularization of additional routes of cannabis use beyond smoking, including edibles, the prevalence of cannabis use in pregnancy is rapidly increasing. However, the potential effects of prenatal cannabis use on fetal developmental programming remain unknown.We designed this study to determine whether the use of edible cannabis during pregnancy is deleterious to the fetal and placental epigenome. Pregnant rhesus macaques consumed a daily edible containing either delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (2.5 mg/7 kg/day) or placebo. DNA methylation was measured in 5 tissues collected at cesarean delivery (placenta, lung, cerebellum, prefrontal cortex, and right ventricle of the heart) using the Illumina MethylationEPIC platform and filtering for probes previously validated in rhesus macaque. In utero exposure to THC was associated with differential methylation at 581 CpGs, with 573 (98%) identified in placenta. Loci differentially methylated with THC were enriched for candidate autism spectrum disorder (ASD) genes from the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI) database in all tissues. The placenta demonstrated greatest SFARI gene enrichment, including genes differentially methylated in placentas from a prospective ASD study.Overall, our findings reveal that prenatal THC exposure alters placental and fetal DNA methylation at genes involved in neurobehavioral development that may influence longer-term offspring outcomes. The data from this study add to the limited existing literature to help guide patient counseling and public health polices focused on prenatal cannabis use in the future.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37489456","LncRNA Functional Screening in Organismal Development.","Noncoding RNA","Controversy continues over the functional prevalence of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) despite their being widely investigated in all kinds of cells and organisms. In animals, lncRNAs have aroused general interest from exponentially increasing transcriptomic repertoires reporting their highly tissue-specific and developmentally dynamic expression, and more importantly, from growing experimental evidence supporting their functionality in facilitating organogenesis and individual fitness. In mammalian testes, while a great multitude of lncRNA species are identified, only a minority of them have been shown to be useful, and even fewer have been demonstrated as true requirements for male fertility using knockout models to date. This noticeable gap is attributed to the virtual existence of a large number of junk lncRNAs, the lack of an ideal germline culture system, difficulty in loss-of-function interrogation, and limited screening strategies. Facing these challenges, in this review, we discuss lncRNA functionality in organismal development and especially in mouse testis, with a focus on lncRNAs with functional screening."
"37415685","Ethical principles, challenges and opportunities when conducting genetic counselling for schizophrenia.","Front Psychiatry","Ethical challenges of genetic counselling for schizophrenia include effective communication of critical scientific information in an easily understood manner by patients and relatives, and the ability to ensure communication is unencumbered by medical jargon. Levels of literacy in the target population may limit this process, making it difficult for patients to attain the desired levels of informed consent to make crucial decisions during genetic counselling. Multilingualism in target communities may further complicate such communication. This paper outlines the ethical principles, challenges and opportunities facing clinicians when conducting genetic counselling for schizophrenia and how these might be met, drawing on lessons from South African studies. The paper draws on reflections of clinician and researcher experiences gained from clinical practice or research on the genetics of schizophrenia and psychotic disorders in South Africa. The context of genetic studies in schizophrenia is used to illustrate the ethical challenges in genetic counselling for schizophrenia, both in clinical and research settings. Attention is also drawn to multicultural and multilingual populations, particularly where the preferred language lacks a well-developed scientific language of communication for some of the genetic concepts that have to be presented during the genetic counselling process. The authors describe the ethical challenges and how to address these to empower patients and relatives to make well-informed decisions despite these obstacles. Principles applied by clinicians and researchers during the genetic counselling are described. Potential solutions, including the establishment of community advisory boards to address potential ethical challenges inherent to the genetic counselling process, are also shared. Genetic counselling for schizophrenia still faces ethical challenges which require a balance of principles of beneficence, autonomy, informed consent, confidentiality and distributive justice, while striving to present accuracy in the science that guides the process. Evolution in language and cultural competency therefore needs to occur alongside scientific advances in genetic research. Key stakeholders need to partner and build capacity and expertise in genetic counselling through the provision of funding and resources. The goal of partnerships is to empower patients, relatives, clinicians and researchers to share scientific information in a manner guided by empathy while retaining scientific accuracy.Copyright © 2023 Zingela, Sokudela, Thungana and van Wyk."
"37404684",NA,NA,"The optimization of genetically engineered biological constructs is a key step to deliver high-impact biotechnological applications. The use of high-throughput DNA assembly methods allows the construction of enough genotypic variants to successfully cover the target design space. This, however, entails extra workload for researchers during the screening stage of candidate variants. Despite the existence of commercial colony pickers, their high price excludes small research laboratories and budget-adjusted institutions from accessing such extensive screening capability. In this work we present COPICK, a technical solution to automatize colony picking in an open-source liquid handler Opentrons OT-2. COPICK relies on a mounted camera to capture images of regular Petri dishes and detect microbial colonies for automated screening. COPICK's software can then automatically select the best colonies according to different criteria (size, color and fluorescence) and execute a protocol to pick them for further analysis. Benchmark tests performed forE. coliandP. putidacolonies delivers a raw picking performance over pickable colonies of 82% with an accuracy of 73.4% at an estimated rate of 240 colonies/h.

"37507485","Quantitative proteomics profiling reveals the inhibition of trastuzumab antitumor efficacy by phosphorylated RPS6 in gastric carcinoma.","Cancer Chemother Pharmacol","The anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab is a standard treatment for gastric carcinoma with HER2 overexpression, but not all patients benefit from treatment with HER2-targeted therapies due to intrinsic and acquired resistance. Thus, more precise predictors for selecting patients to receive trastuzumab therapy are urgently needed.We applied mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis to 38 HER2-positive gastric tumor biopsies from 19 patients pretreated with trastuzumab (responders n = 10; nonresponders, n = 9) to identify factors that may influence innate sensitivity or resistance to trastuzumab therapy and validated the results in tumor cells and patient samples.Statistical analyses revealed significantly lower phosphorylated ribosomal S6 (p-RPS6) levels in responders than nonresponders, and this downregulation was associated with a durable response and better overall survival after anti-HER2 therapy. High p-RPS6 levels could trigger AKT/mTOR/RPS6 signaling and inhibit trastuzumab antitumor efficacy in nonresponders. We demonstrated that RPS6 phosphorylation inhibitors in combination with trastuzumab effectively suppressed HER2-positive GC cell survival through the inhibition of the AKT/mTOR/RPS6 axis.Our findings provide for the first time a detailed proteomics profile of current protein alterations in patients before anti-HER2 therapy and present a novel and optimal predictor for the response to trastuzumab treatment. HER2-positive GC patients with low expression of p-RPS6 are more likely to benefit from trastuzumab therapy than those with high expression. However, those with high expression of p-RPS6 may benefit from trastuzumab in combination with RPS6 phosphorylation inhibitors.© 2023.

"37520992","Transcription factors organize into functional groups on the linear genome and in 3D chromatin.","Heliyon","Transcription factors (TFs) and their binding sites have evolved to interact cooperatively or competitively with each other. Here we examine in detail, across multiple cell lines, such cooperation or competition among TFs both in sequential and spatial proximity (using chromatin conformation capture assays), considering in vivo binding data as well as TF binding motifs in DNA. We ascertain significantly co-occurring (""attractive"") or avoiding (""repulsive"") TF pairs using robust randomized models that retain the essential characteristics of the experimental data. Across human cell lines TFs organize into two groups, with intra-group attraction and inter-group repulsion. This is true for both sequential and spatial proximity, and for both in vivo binding and sequence motifs. Attractive TF pairs exhibit significantly more physical interactions suggesting an underlying mechanism. The two TF groups differ significantly in their genomic and network properties, as well in their function-while one group regulates housekeeping function, the other potentially regulates lineage-specific functions, that are disrupted in cancer. Weaker binding sites tend to occur in spatially interacting regions of the genome. Our results suggest that a complex pattern of spatial cooperativity of TFs and chromatin has evolved with the genome to support housekeeping and lineage-specific functions.© 2023 The Author(s)."
"37511434","Perinatal S-Adenosylmethionine Supplementation Represses PSEN1 Expression by the Cellular Epigenetic Memory of CpG and Non-CpG Methylation in Adult TgCRD8 Mice.","Int J Mol Sci","DNA methylation, the main epigenetic modification regulating gene expression, plays a role in the pathophysiology of neurodegeneration. Previous evidence indicates that 5'-flanking hypomethylation ofPSEN1, a gene involved in the amyloidogenic pathway in Alzheimer's disease (AD), boosts the AD-like phenotype in transgenic TgCRND8 mice. Supplementation with S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the methyl donor in the DNA methylation reactions, reverts the pathological phenotype. Several studies indicate that epigenetic signatures, driving the shift between normal and diseased aging, can be acquired during the first stages of life, even in utero, and manifest phenotypically later on in life. Therefore, we decided to test whether SAM supplementation during the perinatal period (i.e., supplementing the mothers from mating to weaning) could exert a protective role towards AD-like symptom manifestation. We therefore compared the effect of post-weaning vs. perinatal SAM treatment in TgCRND8 mice by assessingPSEN1methylation and expression and the development of amyloid plaques. We found that short-term perinatal supplementation was as effective as the longer post-weaning supplementation in repressingPSEN1expression and amyloid deposition in adult mice. These results highlight the importance of epigenetic memory and methyl donor availability during early life to promote healthy aging and stress the functional role of non-CpG methylation."

We examined a random population sample in 2003/2005 (n= 9360, men/women, 45-69, the HAPIEE project) and followed up for 15 years. Using a nested case-control design, we selected non-external deaths among those free from baseline cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and cancer (n= 371), and a sex- and age-stratified control (n= 785). The odds ratios (ORs) of death were 1.06 (95%CI 1.01-1.11) per one-decile decrease in mtDNA-CN independent of age, sex, metabolic factors, smoking, alcohol intake and education. The age-sex-adjusted ORs of death in the second and first tertiles of mtDNA-CN vs. the top tertile were 2.35 (95% CI 1.70-3.26) and 1.59 (1.16-2.17); an increased risk was confined to the second tertile after controlling for smoking and metabolic factors. The multivariable-adjusted OR of CVD death was 1.92 (95% CI 1.18-3.15) in tertile 2 vs. the top tertile of mtDNA-CN, and for cancer-related death the ORs were 3.66 (95% CI 2.21-6.05) and 2.29 (95% CI 1.43-3.68) in tertiles 2 and 1 vs. the top tertile. In the Siberian population cohort, the mtDNA-CN was an inverse predictor of the 15-year risk of natural mortality, due to the greatest impact of CVD and cancer-related death. The findings merit attention for exploring further the role of mtDNA in human ageing and the diversity of mortality."

"37509121","Counteracting Immunosenescence-Which Therapeutic Strategies Are Promising?","Biomolecules","Aging attenuates the overall responsiveness of the immune system to eradicate pathogens. The increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by innate immune cells under basal conditions, termed inflammaging, contributes to impaired innate immune responsiveness towards pathogen-mediated stimulation and limits antigen-presenting activity. Adaptive immune responses are attenuated as well due to lowered numbers of naïve lymphocytes and their impaired responsiveness towards antigen-specific stimulation. Additionally, the numbers of immunoregulatory cell types, comprising regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, that inhibit the activity of innate and adaptive immune cells are elevated. This review aims to summarize our knowledge on the cellular and molecular causes of immunosenescence while also taking into account senescence effects that constitute immune evasion mechanisms in the case of chronic viral infections and cancer. For tumor therapy numerous nanoformulated drugs have been developed to overcome poor solubility of compounds and to enable cell-directed delivery in order to restore immune functions, e.g., by addressing dysregulated signaling pathways. Further, nanovaccines which efficiently address antigen-presenting cells to mount sustained anti-tumor immune responses have been clinically evaluated. Further, senolytics that selectively deplete senescent cells are being tested in a number of clinical trials. Here we discuss the potential use of such drugs to improve anti-aging therapy."
"37408186","Impact of Combined Baricitinib and FTI Treatment on Adipogenesis in Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome and Other Lipodystrophic Laminopathies.","Cells","Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare genetic disease that causes premature aging symptoms, such as vascular diseases, lipodystrophy, loss of bone mineral density, and alopecia. HGPS is mostly linked to a heterozygous and de novo mutation in the LMNA gene (c.1824 C > T; p.G608G), resulting in the production of a truncated prelamin A protein called ""progerin"". Progerin accumulation causes nuclear dysfunction, premature senescence, and apoptosis. Here, we examined the effects of baricitinib (Bar), an FDA-approved JAK/STAT inhibitor, and a combination of Bar and lonafarnib (FTI) treatment on adipogenesis using skin-derived precursors (SKPs). We analyzed the effect of these treatments on the differentiation potential of SKPs isolated from pre-established human primary fibroblast cultures. Compared to mock-treated HGPS SKPs, Bar and Bar + FTI treatments improved the differentiation of HGPS SKPs into adipocytes and lipid droplet formation. Similarly, Bar and Bar + FTI treatments improved the differentiation of SKPs derived from patients with two other lipodystrophic diseases: familial partial lipodystrophy type 2 (FPLD2) and mandibuloacral dysplasia type B (MADB). Overall, the results show that Bar treatment improves adipogenesis and lipid droplet formation in HGPS, FPLD2, and MADB, indicating that Bar + FTI treatment might further ameliorate HGPS pathologies compared to lonafarnib treatment alone."
"37329949","Chronic inflammation and the hallmarks of aging.","Mol Metab","Recently, the hallmarks of aging were updated to include dysbiosis, disabled macroautophagy, and chronic inflammation. In particular, the low-grade chronic inflammation during aging, without overt infection, is defined as ""inflammaging,"" which is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in the aging population. Emerging evidence suggests a bidirectional and cyclical relationship between chronic inflammation and the development of age-related conditions, such as cardiovascular diseases, neurodegeneration, cancer, and frailty. How the crosstalk between chronic inflammation and other hallmarks of aging underlies biological mechanisms of aging and age-related disease is thus of particular interest to the current geroscience research.This review integrates the cellular and molecular mechanisms of age-associated chronic inflammation with the other eleven hallmarks of aging. Extra discussion is dedicated to the hallmark of ""altered nutrient sensing,"" given the scope of Molecular Metabolism. The deregulation of hallmark processes during aging disrupts the delicate balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory signaling, leading to a persistent inflammatory state. The resultant chronic inflammation, in turn, further aggravates the dysfunction of each hallmark, thereby driving the progression of aging and age-related diseases.The crosstalk between chronic inflammation and other hallmarks of aging results in a vicious cycle that exacerbates the decline in cellular functions and promotes aging. Understanding this complex interplay will provide new insights into the mechanisms of aging and the development of potential anti-aging interventions. Given their interconnectedness and ability to accentuate the primary elements of aging, drivers of chronic inflammation may be an ideal target with high translational potential to address the pathological conditions associated with aging.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

We used logistic regression in the cross-sectional analysis (n=1300), and Cox regression accounting for interval-censored data in the longitudinal analysis (n=1143). We further applied two-level growth models to investigate associations with repeatedly measured traits (fasting glucose, 2 h glucose, fasting insulin, HOMA-B, HOMA-IR, HbA1c), and two-sample Mendelian randomisation analysis to investigate causal associations. Moreover, we built prediction models using priority-Lasso on top of Framingham-Offspring Risk Score components and evaluated the prediction accuracy through AUC.We identified 14, 24 and four proteins associated with prevalent prediabetes (i.e. impaired glucose tolerance and/or impaired fasting glucose), prevalent newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes and incident type 2 diabetes, respectively (28 overlapping proteins). Of these, IL-17D, IL-18 receptor 1, carbonic anhydrase-5A, IL-1 receptor type 2 (IL-1RT2) and matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein were novel candidates. IGF binding protein 2 (IGFBP2), lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and paraoxonase 3 (PON3) were inversely associated while fibroblast growth factor 21 was positively associated with incident type 2 diabetes. LPL was longitudinally linked with change in glucose-related traits, while IGFBP2 and PON3 were linked with changes in both insulin- and glucose-related traits. Mendelian randomisation analysis suggested causal effects of LPL on type 2 diabetes and fasting insulin. The simultaneous addition of 12 priority-Lasso-selected biomarkers (IGFBP2, IL-18, IL-17D, complement component C1q receptor, V-set and immunoglobulin domain-containing protein 2, IL-1RT2, LPL, CUB domain-containing protein 1, vascular endothelial growth factor D, PON3, C-C motif chemokine 4 and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase type 5) significantly improved the predictive performance (ΔAUC 0.0219; 95% CI 0.0052, 0.0624).We identified new candidates involved in the development of derangements in glucose metabolism and type 2 diabetes and confirmed previously reported proteins. Our findings underscore the importance of proteins in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and the identified putative proteins can function as potential pharmacological targets for diabetes treatment and prevention.© 2023.

The cis-trans regulatory dynamics occurred throughout the course of cotton fiber development are elusive. Here we generated genome-wide high-resolution DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) maps to understand the regulatory mechanisms of cotton ovule and fiber development.We generated DNase I hypersensitive site (DHS) profiles from cotton ovules at 0 and 3 days post anthesis (DPA) and fibers at 8, 12, 15, and 18 DPA. We obtained a total of 1185 million reads and identified a total of 199,351 DHSs through ~ 30% unique mapping reads. It should be noted that more than half of DNase-seq reads mapped multiple genome locations and were not analyzed in order to achieve a high specificity of peak profile and to avoid bias from repetitive genomic regions. Distinct chromatin accessibilities were observed in the ovules (0 and 3 DPA) compared to the fiber elongation stages (8, 12, 15, and 18 DPA). Besides, the chromatin accessibility during ovules was particularly elevated in genomic regions enriched with transposable elements (TEs) and genes in TE-enriched regions were involved in ovule cell division. We analyzed cis-regulatory modules and revealed the influence of hormones on fiber development from the regulatory divergence of transcription factor (TF) motifs. Finally, we constructed a reliable regulatory network of TFs related to ovule and fiber development based on chromatin accessibility and gene co-expression network. From this network, we discovered a novel TF, WRKY46, which may shape fiber development by regulating the lignin content.Our results not only reveal the contribution of TEs in fiber development, but also predict and validate the TFs related to fiber development, which will benefit the research of cotton fiber molecular breeding.© 2023.

Here, we present Mellon, a novel computational algorithm for high-resolution estimation of cell-state densities from single-cell data. We demonstrate Mellon's efficacy by dissecting the density landscape of various differentiating systems, revealing a consistent pattern of high-density regions corresponding to major cell types intertwined with low-density, rare transitory states. Utilizing hematopoietic stem cell fate specification to B-cells as a case study, we present evidence implicating enhancer priming and the activation of master regulators in the emergence of these transitory states. Mellon offers the flexibility to perform temporal interpolation of time-series data, providing a detailed view of cell-state dynamics during the inherently continuous developmental processes. Scalable and adaptable, Mellon facilitates density estimation across various single-cell data modalities, scaling linearly with the number of cells. Our work underscores the importance of cell-state density in understanding the differentiation processes, and the potential of Mellon to provide new insights into the regulatory mechanisms guiding cellular fate decisions."

Here we leverage single-cell chromatin accessibility profiling of 22 AML bone marrow aspirates from eight patients at time of therapy resistance and following subsequent therapy to characterize their lineage landscape. Our findings reveal a complex lineage architecture of therapy-resistant AML cells that are primed for stem and progenitor lineages and spanning quiescent, activated and late stem cell/progenitor states. Remarkably, therapy-resistant AML cells are also composed of cells primed for differentiated myeloid, erythroid and even lymphoid lineages. The heterogeneous lineage composition persists following subsequent therapy, with early progenitor-driven features marking unfavorable prognosis in The Cancer Genome Atlas AML cohort. Pseudotime analysis further confirms the vast degree of heterogeneity driven by the dynamic changes in chromatin accessibility. Our findings suggest that therapy-resistant AML cells are characterized not only by stem and progenitor states, but also by a continuum of differentiated cellular lineages. The heterogeneity in lineages likely contributes to their therapy resistance by harboring different degrees of lineage-specific susceptibilities to therapy.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37468546","Single-nucleus chromatin landscapes during zebrafish early embryogenesis.","Sci Data","Vertebrate embryogenesis is a remarkable process, during which numerous cell types of different lineages arise within a short time frame. An overwhelming challenge to understand this process is the lack of dynamic chromatin accessibility information to correlate cis-regulatory elements (CREs) and gene expression within the hierarchy of cell fate decisions. Here, we employed single-nucleus ATAC-seq to generate a chromatin accessibility dataset on the first day of zebrafish embryogenesis, including 3.3 hpf, 5.25 hpf, 6 hpf, 10 hpf, 12 hpf, 18 hpf and 24 hpf, obtained 51,620 high-quality nuclei and 23 clusters. Furthermore, by integrating snATAC-seq data with single-cell RNA-seq data, we described the dynamics of chromatin accessibility and gene expression across developmental time points, which validates the accuracy of the chromatin landscape data. Together, our data could serve as a fundamental resource for revealing the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms of zebrafish embryogenesis.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37443338","SCENIC+: single-cell multiomic inference of enhancers and gene regulatory networks.","Nat Methods","Joint profiling of chromatin accessibility and gene expression in individual cells provides an opportunity to decipher enhancer-driven gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Here we present a method for the inference of enhancer-driven GRNs, called SCENIC+. SCENIC+ predicts genomic enhancers along with candidate upstream transcription factors (TFs) and links these enhancers to candidate target genes. To improve both recall and precision of TF identification, we curated and clustered a motif collection with more than 30,000 motifs. We benchmarked SCENIC+ on diverse datasets from different species, including human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, ENCODE cell lines, melanoma cell states and Drosophila retinal development. Next, we exploit SCENIC+ predictions to study conserved TFs, enhancers and GRNs between human and mouse cell types in the cerebral cortex. Finally, we use SCENIC+ to study the dynamics of gene regulation along differentiation trajectories and the effect of TF perturbations on cell state.

Emerging evidence indicates that cholecystokinin (CCK)-expressing interneurons (CCK+) are highly heterogenous. We find that a large subset of parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons express CCK strongly; between 40 and 56% of PV+ interneurons in mouse hippocampal CA1 express CCK. Primate interneurons also exhibit substantial PV/CCK co-expression. Mouse PV+/CCK+ and PV+/CCK- cells show distinguishable electrophysiological and molecular characteristics. Analysis of single nuclei RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data shows that PV+/CCK+ cells are a subset of PV+ cells, not of synuclein gamma positive (SNCG+) cells, and that they strongly express oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) genes. We find that mitochondrial complex I and IV-associated OXPHOS gene expression is strongly correlated with CCK expression in PV+ interneurons at both the transcriptomic and protein levels. Both PV+ interneurons and dysregulation of OXPHOS processes are implicated in neuropsychiatric conditions, including autism spectrum (ASD) disorder and schizophrenia (SCZ). Analysis of human brain samples from patients with these conditions shows alterations in OXPHOS gene expression. Together these data reveal important molecular characteristics of PV-CCK co-expressing interneurons and support their implication in neuropsychiatric conditions.© 2023. The Author(s)."

The current constructs, however, have variable efficiency and may require laborious experimental optimization. This study presents statistical models for learning the salient epigenomic and sequence features of target sites modulating the editing efficiency and provides guidelines for designing optimal PEs. We found that both regional constitutive heterochromatin and local nucleosome occlusion of target sites impede editing, while position-specific G/C nucleotides in the primer-binding site (PBS) and reverse transcription (RT) template regions of PE guide RNA (pegRNA) yield high editing efficiency, especially for short PBS designs. The presence of G/C nucleotides was most critical immediately 5' to the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) site for all designs. The effects of different last templated nucleotides were quantified and observed to depend on the length of both PBS and RT templates. Our models found AGG to be the preferred PAM and detected a guanine nucleotide four bases downstream of the PAM to facilitate editing, suggesting a hitherto-unrecognized interaction with Cas9. A neural network interpretation method based on nonextensive statistical mechanics further revealed multi-nucleotide preferences, indicating dependency among several bases across pegRNA. Our work clarifies previous conflicting observations and uncovers context-dependent features important for optimizing PE designs.Copyright © 2023 Kim, Yuan, Woods, Newton, Perez-Pinera and Song."
"37426106","Treatment-associated mRNA co-expression changes in monocytes of patients with posttraumatic stress disorder.","Front Psychiatry","PTSD is a prevalent mental disorder that results from exposure to extreme and stressful life events and comes at high costs for both the individual and society. Therapeutic treatment presents the best way to deal with PTSD-the mechanisms underlying change after treatment, however, remain poorly understood. While stress and immune associated gene expression changes have been associated with PTSD development, studies investigating treatment effects at the molecular level so far tended to focus on DNA methylation. Here we use gene-network analysis on whole-transcriptome RNA-Seq data isolated from CD14+monocytes of female PTSD patients (N = 51) to study pre-treatment signatures of therapy response and therapy-related changes at the level of gene expression. Patients who exhibited significant symptom improvement after therapy showed higher baseline expression in two modules involved in inflammatory processes (including notable examplesIL1R2andFKBP5) and blood coagulation. After therapy, expression of an inflammatory module was increased, and expression of a wound healing module was decreased. This supports findings reporting an association between PTSD and dysregulations of the inflammatory and the hemostatic system and mark both as potentially treatment sensitive.Copyright © 2023 Kumsta, Zang, Hummel, Müller, Moser, Herpertz and Kessler."

A few studies have linked the methylation pattern of LINE-1 to different mental disorders (e.g., post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD], autism spectrum disorder [ASD], panic disorder [PD]). We sought to unify the existing knowledge in the field and provide a better understanding of the association between mental disorders and LINE-1 methylation.A systematic review was executed with 12 eligible articles according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.For psychotic disorders, PTSD, ASD, and PD, lower LINE-1 methylation levels were detected, whereas for mood disorders, the findings are controversial. The studies were conducted with subjects aged 18-80 years. Peripheral blood samples were utilized in 7/12 articles.Although most studies have shown that LINE-1 hypomethylation was associated with mental disorders, there were still some divergences (i.e., hypermethylation associated with mental disorders).

Today, nanopore sequencing is one of the leading third-generation sequencing technologies. With its long reads, portability, and low cost, nanopore sequencing is widely used in various scientific fields including epidemic prevention and control, disease diagnosis, and animal and plant breeding. Despite initial concerns about high error rates, continuous innovation in sequencing platforms and algorithm analysis technology has effectively addressed its accuracy. During the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, nanopore sequencing played a critical role in detecting the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 virus genome and containing the pandemic. However, a lack of understanding of this technology may limit its popularization and application. Nanopore sequencing is poised to become the mainstream choice for preventing and controlling COVID-19 and future epidemics while creating value in other fields such as oncology and botany.

"37398417","The variation and evolution of complete human centromeres.","bioRxiv","We completely sequenced and assembled all centromeres from a second human genome and used two reference sets to benchmark genetic, epigenetic, and evolutionary variation within centromeres from a diversity panel of humans and apes. We find that centromere single-nucleotide variation can increase by up to 4.1-fold relative to other genomic regions, with the caveat that up to 45.8% of centromeric sequence, on average, cannot be reliably aligned with current methods due to the emergence of new α-satellite higher-order repeat (HOR) structures and two to threefold differences in the length of the centromeres. The extent to which this occurs differs depending on the chromosome and haplotype. Comparing the two sets of complete human centromeres, we find that eight harbor distinctly different α-satellite HOR array structures and four contain novel α-satellite HOR variants in high abundance. DNA methylation and CENP-A chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments show that 26% of the centromeres differ in their kinetochore position by at least 500 kbp-a property not readily associated with novel α-satellite HORs. To understand evolutionary change, we selected six chromosomes and sequenced and assembled 31 orthologous centromeres from the common chimpanzee, orangutan, and macaque genomes. Comparative analyses reveal nearly complete turnover of α-satellite HORs, but with idiosyncratic changes in structure characteristic to each species. Phylogenetic reconstruction of human haplotypes supports limited to no recombination between the p- and q-arms of human chromosomes and reveals that novel α-satellite HORs share a monophyletic origin, providing a strategy to estimate the rate of saltatory amplification and mutation of human centromeric DNA."
"37511104","Endothelial Senescence and Its Impact on Angiogenesis in Alzheimer's Disease.","Int J Mol Sci","Endothelial cells are constantly exposed to environmental stress factors that, above a certain threshold, trigger cellular senescence and apoptosis. The altered vascular function affects new vessel formation and endothelial fitness, contributing to the progression of age-related diseases. This narrative review highlights the complex interplay between senescence, oxidative stress, extracellular vesicles, and the extracellular matrix and emphasizes the crucial role of angiogenesis in aging and Alzheimer's disease. The interaction between the vascular and nervous systems is essential for the development of a healthy brain, especially since neurons are exceptionally dependent on nutrients carried by the blood. Therefore, anomalies in the delicate balance between pro- and antiangiogenic factors and the consequences of disrupted angiogenesis, such as misalignment, vascular leakage and disturbed blood flow, are responsible for neurodegeneration. The implications of altered non-productive angiogenesis in Alzheimer's disease due to dysregulated Delta-Notch and VEGF signaling are further explored. Additionally, potential therapeutic strategies such as exercise and caloric restriction to modulate angiogenesis and vascular aging and to mitigate the associated debilitating symptoms are discussed. Moreover, both the roles of extracellular vesicles in stress-induced senescence and as an early detection marker for Alzheimer's disease are considered. The intricate relationship between endothelial senescence and angiogenesis provides valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying angiogenesis-related disorders and opens avenues for future research and therapeutic interventions."
"37443741","Microvesicle-Mediated Tissue Regeneration Mitigates the Effects of Cellular Ageing.","Cells","Extracellular vesicles (EVs), comprising microvesicles (MVs) and exosomes (Exos), are membranous vesicles secreted by cells which mediate the repair of cellular and tissue damage via paracrine mechanisms. The action of EVs under normative and morbid conditions in the context of ageing remains largely unexplored. We demonstrate that MVs, but not Exos, from Pathfinder cells (PCs), a putative stem cell regulatory cell type, enhance the repair of human dermal fibroblast (HDF) and mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) co-cultures, following both mechanical and genotoxic stress. Critically, this effect was found to be both cellular age and stress specific. Notably, MV treatment was unable to repair mechanical injury in older co-cultures but remained therapeutic following genotoxic stress. These observations were further confirmed in human dermal fibroblast (HDF) and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) co-cultures of increasing cellular age. In a model of comorbidity comprising co-cultures of HDFs and highly senescent abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) VSMCs, MV administration appeared to be senotherapeutic, following both mechanical and genotoxic stress. Our data provide insights into EVs and the specific roles they play during tissue repair and ageing. These data will potentiate the development of novel cell-free therapeutic interventions capable of attenuating age-associated morbidities and avoiding undesired effects."
"37418548","Restoring tumor immunogenicity with dendritic cell reprogramming.","Sci Immunol","Decreased antigen presentation contributes to the ability of cancer cells to evade the immune system. We used the minimal gene regulatory network of type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1) to reprogram cancer cells into professional antigen-presenting cells (tumor-APCs). Enforced expression of the transcription factors PU.1, IRF8, and BATF3 (PIB) was sufficient to induce the cDC1 phenotype in 36 cell lines derived from human and mouse hematological and solid tumors. Within 9 days of reprogramming, tumor-APCs acquired transcriptional and epigenetic programs associated with cDC1 cells. Reprogramming restored the expression of antigen presentation complexes and costimulatory molecules on the surfaces of tumor cells, allowing the presentation of endogenous tumor antigens on MHC-I and facilitating targeted killing by CD8+T cells. Functionally, tumor-APCs engulfed and processed proteins and dead cells, secreted inflammatory cytokines, and cross-presented antigens to naïve CD8+T cells. Human primary tumor cells could also be reprogrammed to increase their capability to present antigen and to activate patient-specific tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. In addition to acquiring improved antigen presentation, tumor-APCs had impaired tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo. Injection of in vitro generated melanoma-derived tumor-APCs into subcutaneous melanoma tumors delayed tumor growth and increased survival in mice. Antitumor immunity elicited by tumor-APCs was synergistic with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Our approach serves as a platform for the development of immunotherapies that endow cancer cells with the capability to process and present endogenous tumor antigens."

The application of such technologies represents a flourishing field of research in human medicine, especially in transfusion medicine, while their application in veterinary medicine still needs to be developed.Omics technologies, especially proteomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics, are currently applied in several fields of human medicine. In transfusion medicine, the creation and integration of multiomics datasets have uncovered intricate molecular pathways occurring within blood bags during storage. In particular, the research has been directed toward the study of storage lesions (SLs), i.e., those biochemical and structural changes that red blood cells (RBCs) undergo during hypothermic storage, their causes, and the development of new strategies to prevent them. However, due to their challenges to perform and high costs, these technologies are hardly accessible to veterinary research, where their application dates back only to the last few years and thus a great deal of progress still needs to be made. As regards veterinary medicine, there are only a few studies that have focused mainly on fields such as oncology, nutrition, cardiology, and nephrology. Other studies have suggested omics datasets that provide important insights for future comparative investigations between human and nonhuman species. Regarding the study of storage lesions and, more generally, the veterinary transfusion field, there is a marked lack of available omics data and results with relevance for clinical practice.The use of omics technologies in human medicine is well established and has led to promising results in blood transfusion and related practices knowledge. Transfusion practice is a burgeoning field in veterinary medicine, but, to date, there are no species-specific procedures and techniques for the collection and storage of blood units and those validated in the human species are univocally pursued. Multiomics analysis of the species-specific RBCs' biological characteristics could provide promising results both from a comparative perspective, by increasing our understanding of species suitable to be used as animal models, and in a strictly veterinary view, by contributing to the development of animal-targeted procedures.© 2023 The Author(s).

"37442953","Integrative modeling of lncRNA-chromatin interaction maps reveals diverse mechanisms of nuclear retention.","BMC Genomics","Many long non-coding RNAs, known to be involved in transcriptional regulation, are enriched in the nucleus and interact with chromatin. However, their mechanisms of chromatin interaction and the served cellular functions are poorly understood. We sought to characterize the mechanisms of lncRNA nuclear retention by systematically mapping the sequence and chromatin features that distinguish lncRNA-interacting genomic segments.We found DNA 5-mer frequencies to be predictive of chromatin interactions for all lncRNAs, suggesting sequence-specificity as a global theme in the interactome. Sequence features representing protein-DNA and protein-RNA binding motifs revealed potential mechanisms for specific lncRNAs. Complementary to these global themes, transcription-related features and DNA-RNA triplex formation potential were noted to be highly predictive for two mutually exclusive sets of lncRNAs. DNA methylation was also noted to be a significant predictor, but only when combined with other epigenomic features.Taken together, our statistical findings suggest that a group of lncRNAs interacts with transcriptionally inactive chromatin through triplex formation, whereas another group interacts with transcriptionally active regions and is involved in DNA Damage Response (DDR) through formation of R-loops. Curiously, we observed a strong pattern of enrichment of 5-mers in four potentially interacting entities: lncRNA-bound DNA tiles, lncRNAs, miRNA seed sequences, and repeat elements. This finding points to a broad sequence-based network of interactions that may underlie regulation of fundamental cellular functions. Overall, this study reveals diverse sequence and chromatin features related to lncRNA-chromatin interactions, suggesting potential mechanisms of nuclear retention and regulatory function.© 2023.

"37442824","An unwelcome inheritance: childhood obesity after diabetes in pregnancy.","Diabetologia","Diabetes in pregnancy affects 20 million women per year and is associated with increased risk of obesity in offspring, leading to insulin resistance and cardiometabolic disease. Despite the substantial public health ramifications, relatively little is known about the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying obesity in these high-risk children, which creates a barrier to successful intervention. While maternal glucose itself is undeniably a major stimulus upon intrauterine growth, the degree of offspring hyperinsulinism and disturbed lipid metabolism in mothers and offspring are also likely to be implicated in the disease process. The aim of this review is to summarise current understanding of the pathophysiology of childhood obesity after intrauterine exposure to maternal hyperglycaemia and to highlight possible opportunities for intervention. I present here a new unified hypothesis for the pathophysiology of childhood obesity in infants born to mothers with diabetes, which involves self-perpetuating twin cycles of pancreatic beta cell hyperfunction and altered lipid metabolism, both acutely and chronically upregulated by intrauterine exposure to maternal hyperglycaemia.© 2023.

"37470973","Disease Assessments in Patients with Glioblastoma.","Curr Oncol Rep","The neuro-oncology team faces a unique challenge when assessing treatment response in patients diagnosed with glioblastoma. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remains the standard imaging modality for measuring therapeutic response in both clinical practice and clinical trials. However, even for the neuroradiologist, MRI interpretations are not straightforward because of tumor heterogeneity, as evidenced by varying degrees of enhancement, infiltrating tumor patterns, cellular densities, and vasogenic edema. The situation is even more perplexing following therapy since treatment-related changes can mimic viable tumor. Additionally, antiangiogenic therapies can dramatically decrease contrast enhancement giving the false impression of decreasing tumor burden. Over the past few decades, several approaches have emerged to augment and improve visual interpretation of glioblastoma response to therapeutics. Herein, we summarize the state of the art for evaluating the response of glioblastoma to standard therapies and investigational agents as well as challenges and future directions for assessing treatment response in neuro-oncology.Monitoring glioblastoma responses to standard therapy and novel agents has been fraught with many challenges and limitations over the past decade. Excitingly, new promising methods are emerging to help address these challenges. Recently, the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) working group proposed an updated response criteria (RANO 2.0) for the evaluation of all grades of glial tumors regardless of IDH status or therapies being evaluated. In addition, advanced neuroimaging techniques, such as histogram analysis, parametric response maps, morphometric segmentation, radio pharmacodynamics approaches, and the integrating of amino acid radiotracers in the tumor evaluation algorithm may help resolve equivocal lesion interpretations without operative intervention. Moreover, the introduction of other techniques, such as liquid biopsy and artificial intelligence could complement conventional visual assessment of glioblastoma response to therapies. Neuro-oncology has evolved over the past decade and has achieved significant milestones, including the establishment of new standards of care, emerging therapeutic options, and novel clinical, translational, and basic research. More recently, the integration of histopathology with molecular features for tumor classification has marked an important paradigm shift in brain tumor diagnosis. In a similar manner, treatment response monitoring in neuro-oncology has made considerable progress. While most techniques are still in their inception, there is an emerging body of evidence for clinical application.

Here, using a series of questions that highlight differing perspectives about the nature of aging, we ask how data from Drosophila melanogaster at the organismal, tissue, cellular, and molecular levels shed light on the complex interactions among the phenotypes associated with aging. Should aging be viewed as an individual's increasing probability of mortality over time or as a progression of physiological states? Are all age-correlated changes in physiology detrimental to vigor or are some compensatory changes that maintain vigor? Why do different age-correlated functions seem to change at different rates in a single individual as it ages? Should aging be considered as a single, integrated process across the scales of biological resolution, from organismal to molecular, or must we consider each level of biological scale as a separate, distinct entity? Viewing aging from these differing perspectives yields distinct but complementary interpretations about the properties and mechanisms of aging and may offer a path through the complexities related to understanding the nature of aging.Published by Elsevier B.V."

A computational approach with reliable interpretability is needed to infer the function of genes, particularly for non-coding RNAs. We have analyzed genomic features that are present across both coding and non-coding genes like transcription factor (TF) and cofactor ChIP-seq (823), histone modifications ChIP-seq (n = 621), cap analysis gene expression (CAGE) tags (n = 255), and DNase hypersensitivity profiles (n = 255) to predict ontology-based functions of genes. Our approach for gene function prediction was reliable (>90% balanced accuracy) for 486 gene-sets. PubMed abstract mining and CRISPR screens supported the inferred association of genes with biological functions, for which our method had high accuracy. Further analysis revealed that TF-binding patterns at promoters have high predictive strength for multiple functions. TF-binding patterns at the promoter add an unexplored dimension of explainable regulatory aspects of genes and their functions. Therefore, we performed a comprehensive analysis for the functional-specificity of TF-binding patterns at promoters and used them for clustering functions to reveal many latent groups of gene-sets involved in common major cellular processes. We also showed how our approach could be used to infer the functions of non-coding genes using the CRISPR screens of coding genes, which were validated using a long non-coding RNA CRISPR screen. Thus our results demonstrated the generality of our approach by using gene-sets from CRISPR screens. Overall, our approach opens an avenue for predicting the involvement of non-coding genes in various functions.© 2023 The Authors."

"37438529","Complementary Alu sequences mediate enhancer-promoter selectivity.","Nature","Enhancers determine spatiotemporal gene expression programs by engaging with long-range promoters1-4. However, it remains unknown how enhancers find their cognate promoters. We recently developed a RNA in situ conformation sequencing technology to identify enhancer-promoter connectivity using pairwise interacting enhancer RNAs and promoter-derived noncoding RNAs5,6. Here we apply this technology to generate high-confidence enhancer-promoter RNA interaction maps in six additional cell lines. Using these maps, we discover that 37.9% of the enhancer-promoter RNA interaction sites are overlapped with Alu sequences. These pairwise interacting Alu and non-Alu RNA sequences tend to be complementary and potentially form duplexes. Knockout of Alu elements compromises enhancer-promoter looping, whereas Alu insertion or CRISPR-dCasRx-mediated Alu tethering to unregulated promoter RNAs can create new loops to homologous enhancers. Mapping 535,404 noncoding risk variants back to the enhancer-promoter RNA interaction maps enabled us to construct variant-to-function maps for interpreting their molecular functions, including 15,318 deletions or insertions in 11,677 Alu elements that affect 6,497 protein-coding genes. We further demonstrate that polymorphic Alu insertion at the PTK2 enhancer can promote tumorigenesis. Our study uncovers a principle for determining enhancer-promoter pairing specificity and provides a framework to link noncoding risk variants to their molecular functions.© 2023.

The Cys2-His2(C2H2) zinc finger domain TYPE2 TYPE3 domains of ZFP296 co-regulated the modification level of the trimethylation of lysine 9 on the histone H3 protein subunit (H3K9me3). According to ChIP-seq analysis, ZFP296 was also enriched inTrim28,Suv39h1,Setdb1,Kdm4a, andEhmt2in the mESC genome. Then, knockdown of the expression ofZfp296at the late zygote of the mouse led to the early developmental arrest of the mouse embryos and failure resulting from a decrease in H3K9me3. Together, our results reveal thatZfp296is an H3K9me3 modulator which is essential to the embryonic genome activation of mouse embryos."

While several bioinformatics tools for DNA methylation analysis have been adapted for cfMeDIP-seq data, an end-to-end pipeline and quality control framework specifically for this data type is still lacking. Here, we present the MEDIPIPE, which provides a one-stop solution for cfMeDIP-seq data quality control, methylation quantification, and sample aggregation. The major advantages of MEDIPIPE are: (i) ease of implementation and reproducibility with Snakemake containerized execution environments that will be automatically deployed via Conda; (ii) flexibility to handle different experimental settings with a single configuration file; and (iii) computationally efficiency for large-scale cfMeDIP-seq profiling data analysis and aggregation.This pipeline is an open-source software under the MIT license and it is freely available at https://github.com/pughlab/MEDIPIPE.© The Author(s) 2023.

"37427348","Role of RNA methylation in the regulation of pancreatic cancer stem cells (Review).","Oncol Lett","Pancreatic cancer stem cells (CSCs) play a key role in the initiation and progression of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC). CSCs are responsible for resistance to chemotherapy and radiation, and for cancer metastasis. Recent studies have indicated that RNA methylation, a type of RNA modification, predominantly occurring as m6A methylation, plays an important role in controlling the stemness of cancer cells, therapeutic resistance against chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and their overall relevance to a patient's prognosis. CSCs regulate various behaviors of cancer through cell-cell communication by secreting factors, through their receptors, and through signal transduction. Recent studies have shown that RNA methylation is involved in the biology of the heterogeneity of PDAC. The present review provides an update on the current understanding of RNA modification-based therapeutic targets against deleterious PDAC. Several key pathways and agents that can specifically target CSCs have been identified, thus providing novel insights into the early diagnosis and efficient treatment of PDAC.Copyright: © Tsuji et al."

Autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease-MUC1(ADTKD-MUC1) is caused by specific frameshift variants in the coding VNTR of theMUC1gene. Calling variants from VNTR using short-read sequencing (SRS) is challenging due to poor read mappability. We developed a computational pipeline, VNtyper, for reliable detection ofMUC1VNTR pathogenic variants and demonstrated its clinical utility in two distinct cohorts: (1) a historical cohort including 108 families with ADTKD and (2) a replication naive cohort comprising 2,910 patients previously tested on a panel of genes involved in monogenic renal diseases. In the historical cohort all cases known to carry pathogenicMUC1variants were re-identified, and a new 25bp-frameshift insertion in an additional mislaid family was detected. In the replication cohort, we discovered and validated 30 new patients.© 2023 The Authors."

In mammals, three RUNX members, namely RUNX1, RUNX2, and RUNX3, play distinct and redundant roles, although RUNX2 is a dominant factor in skeletal development and several skeletal diseases. This review is to provide an overview of the current understanding of RUNX-mediated transcriptional regulation in different skeletal cell types.Advances in chromatin immunoprecipitation and next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) have revealed genome-wide RUNX-mediated gene regulatory mechanisms, including their association with cis-regulatory elements and putative target genes. Further studies with genome-wide analysis and biochemical assays have shed light on RUNX-mediated pioneering action and involvements of RUNX2 in lipid-lipid phase separation. Emerging multi-layered mechanisms of RUNX-mediated gene regulations help us better understanding of skeletal development and diseases, which also provides clues to think how genome-wide studies can help develop therapeutic strategies for skeletal diseases.© 2023.

Here we generated the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Reference Assembly Panel (ScRAP) comprising reference-quality genomes for 142 strains representing the species' phylogenetic and ecological diversity. The ScRAP includes phased haplotype assemblies for several heterozygous diploid and polyploid isolates. We identified circa (ca.) 4,800 nonredundant SVs that provide a broad view of the genomic diversity, including the dynamics of telomere length and transposable elements. We uncovered frequent cases of complex aneuploidies where large chromosomes underwent large deletions and translocations. We found that SVs can impact gene expression near the breakpoints and substantially contribute to gene repertoire evolution. We also discovered that horizontally acquired regions insert at chromosome ends and can generate new telomeres. Overall, the ScRAP demonstrates the benefit of a pangenome in understanding genome evolution at population scale.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37452091","The complete and fully-phased diploid genome of a male Han Chinese.","Cell Res","Since the release of the complete human genome, the priority of human genomic study has now been shifting towards closing gaps in ethnic diversity. Here, we present a fully phased and well-annotated diploid human genome from a Han Chinese male individual (CN1), in which the assemblies of both haploids achieve the telomere-to-telomere (T2T) level. Comparison of this diploid genome with the CHM13 haploid T2T genome revealed significant variations in the centromere. Outside the centromere, we discovered 11,413 structural variations, including numerous novel ones. We also detected thousands of CN1 alleles that have accumulated high substitution rates and a few that have been under positive selection in the East Asian population. Further, we found that CN1 outperforms CHM13 as a reference genome in mapping and variant calling for the East Asian population owing to the distinct structural variants of the two references. Comparison of SNP calling for a large cohort of 8869 Chinese genomes using CN1 and CHM13 as reference respectively showed that the reference bias profoundly impacts rare SNP calling, with nearly 2 million rare SNPs miss-called with different reference genomes. Finally, applying the CN1 as a reference, we discovered 5.80 Mb and 4.21 Mb putative introgression sequences from Neanderthal and Denisovan, respectively, including many East Asian specific ones undetected using CHM13 as the reference. Our analyses reveal the advances of using CN1 as a reference for population genomic studies and paleo-genomic studies.

An important feature of aging is skin aging, and women are particularly concerned about skin aging. In the field of cosmetics, the market share of anti-aging products is increasing year by year. This article reviews the research and development progress of skin aging and related active compounds both domestically and internationally in recent years. The results show that, in terms of the research on skin aging, the popular theories mainly include free radicals and oxidative stress theory, inflammation theory, photoaging theory, and nonenzymatic glycosyl chemistry theory. In terms of research on the active ingredients with anti-aging activities in the skin, there are numerous reports on related products in clinical studies on human subjects, animal experiments, and experimental studies on cell cultures, with a variety of types. Most of the compounds against skin aging are sourced from natural products and their action mechanisms are mainly related to scavenging oxygen free radicals and enhancing antioxidant defenses. This review provides important references for the future research of skin aging and the development of related products. Although there is a great progress in skin aging including related active ingredients, ideal compounds or products are still lacking and need to be further validated. New mechanisms of skin aging, new active ingredients sourced from natural and artificial products, and new pharmaceutical forms including further clinical validations should be further investigated in the future."

"37445387","Prevention of Atrial Fibrillation: Putting Proteostasis Derailment Back on Track.","J Clin Med","Despite the many attempts to treat atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common cardiac tachyarrhythmia in the Western world, the treatment efficacy of AF is still suboptimal. A plausible reason for the suboptimal efficacy is that the current treatments are not directed at the underlying molecular mechanisms that drive AF. Recent discoveries revealed that the derailment of specific molecular proteostasis pathways drive electrical conduction disorders, contractile dysfunction and AF. The degree of this so-called 'electropathology' corresponds to the response to anti-AF treatment. Hence, to develop effective therapies to prevent AF, understanding the molecular mechanisms is of key importance. In this review, we highlight the key modulators of proteostasis derailment and describe the mechanisms that explain how they affect electrical and contractile function in atrial cardiomyocytes and AF. The key modulators of proteostasis derailment include (1) exhaustion of cardioprotective heat shock proteins (HSPs), (2) excessive endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and downstream autophagic protein degradation, (3) histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6)-induced microtubule disruption, (4) activation of DNA damage-PARP1 activation and NAD+axis and (5) mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, we discuss druggable targets within these pathways that are involved in the prevention of proteostasis derailment, as well as the targets that aid in the recovery from AF. Finally, we will elaborate on the most favorable druggable targets for (future) testing in patients with AF, as well as drugs with potential benefits for AF recovery."

This systematic review provides an updated overview of the available food and nutrient intake data for pregnant women in The Netherlands and an evaluation based on the current recommendations. Embase, MEDLINE, and national institute databases were used. Articles were selected if they had been published since 2008 and contained data on food consumption, nutrient intake, or the status of healthy pregnant women. A qualitative comparison was made with the 2021 Dutch Health Council recommendations and reference values. A total of 218 reports were included, representing 54 individual studies. Dietary assessments were primarily performed via food frequency questionnaires. Protein, vitamin A, thiamin, riboflavin, vitamin B6, folate, vitamin B12, vitamin C, iron, calcium, and magnesium intakes seemed to be adequate. For folate and vitamin D, supplements were needed to reach the recommended intake. The reasons for concern are the low intakes of fruits, vegetables, and (fatty) fish, and the intakes of alcohol, sugary drinks, and salt. For several foods and nutrients, no or limited intake data were found. High-quality, representative, and recent data are needed to evaluate the nutrient intake of pregnant women in order to make accurate assessments and evaluations, supporting scientific-based advice and national nutritional policies."
"37461646","Accounting for sex differences as a continuous variable in cancer treatments.","Res Sq","The significant sex differences that exist in cancer mechanisms, incidence, and survival, have yet to impact clinical practice. We propose that one barrier to translation is that sex differences in cancer phenotypes resemble sex differences in height: highly overlapping, but distinct, male and female population distributions that vary continuously between female- and male- skewed extremes. A consequence of this variance is that sex-specific treatments are rendered unrealistic, and our translational goal should be adaptation of treatment to the variable sex-effect on targetable pathways. To develop a tool that could advance this goal, we applied a Bayesian Nearest Neighbor (BNN) analysis to 8370 cancer transcriptomes from 26 different adult and 4 different pediatric cancer types to establish patient-specific Transcriptomic Indices (TI). TI precisely positions a patient's whole transcriptome on axes of mechanistic phenotypes like cell cycle signaling and immunity that exhibit skewing in the cancer population relative to sex-identified extremes (poles). Importantly, the TI approach reveals that even when TI values are identical, underlying mechanisms in male and female individuals can differ in identifiable ways. Thus, cancer type, patient sex, and TI value provides a novel and patient- specific mechanistic identifier that can be used for precision cancer treatment planning."

The data used in this study was obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted between 2009 and 2014. The study analyzed a total of 5,339 individuals, divided into a control group (n = 5,135) and a stroke group (n = 162). The researchers utilized multiple logistic regression and smoothed curve fitting to examine the relationship between urinary caffeine and caffeine metabolites and the incidence of stroke. The study found that higher urinary caffeine levels were associated with a lower risk of stroke in Mexican American participants (odds ratio [OR] = 0.886, 95% confidence interval [CI]: (0.791, 0.993), P = 0.037). After adjusting for certain participant characteristics, it was also found that higher urinary paraxanthine levels were associated with a lower risk of stroke incidence (OR = 0.991, 95% CI (0.984, 0.999), P = 0.027). Meanwhile, the highest urinary paraxanthine levels group had 43.7% fewer strokes than the lowest level group (OR = 0.563, 95% CI (0.341, 0.929), P = 0.025). In this study, we showed a negative link between urine paraxanthine levels and the risk of stroke. Meanwhile, urinary caffeine levels were negatively associated with the incidence of stroke in Mexican Americans, but no correlation in other populations. Our findings may have predictive and diagnostic implications in clinical practice. Further extensive prospective investigations are still needed to validate our conclusions.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Several methods have been developed for dimensionality reduction, but they are limited to cross-sectional datasets. The recently proposed Aligned-UMAP, an extension of the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) algorithm, can visualize high-dimensional longitudinal datasets. We demonstrated its utility for researchers to identify exciting patterns and trajectories within enormous datasets in biological sciences. We found that the algorithm parameters also play a crucial role and must be tuned carefully to utilize the algorithm's potential fully. We also discussed key points to remember and directions for future extensions of Aligned-UMAP. Further, we made our code open source to enhance the reproducibility and applicability of our work. We believe our benchmarking study becomes more important as more and more high-dimensional longitudinal data in biomedical research become available."
"37452207","Genetics of diabetes-associated microvascular complications.","Diabetologia","Diabetes is associated with excess morbidity and mortality due to both micro- and macrovascular complications, as well as a range of non-classical comorbidities. Diabetes-associated microvascular complications are those considered most closely related to hyperglycaemia in a causal manner. However, some individuals with hyperglycaemia (even those with severe hyperglycaemia) do not develop microvascular diseases, which, together with evidence of co-occurrence of microvascular diseases in families, suggests a role for genetics. While genome-wide association studies (GWASs) produced firm evidence of multiple genetic variants underlying differential susceptibility to type 1 and type 2 diabetes, genetic determinants of microvascular complications are mostly suggestive. Identified susceptibility variants of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in type 2 diabetes mirror variants underlying chronic kidney disease (CKD) in individuals without diabetes. As for retinopathy and neuropathy, reported risk variants currently lack large-scale replication. The reported associations between type 2 diabetes risk variants and microvascular complications may be explained by hyperglycaemia. More extensive phenotyping, along with adjustments for unmeasured confounding, including both early (fetal) and late-life (hyperglycaemia, hypertension, etc.) environmental factors, are urgently needed to understand the genetics of microvascular complications. Finally, genetic variants associated with reduced glycolysis, mitochondrial dysfunction and DNA damage and sustained cell regeneration may protect against microvascular complications, illustrating the utility of studies in individuals who have escaped these complications.© 2023.

In this article, we present a series of freely available, predominantly web-based platforms and bioinformatic tools that can be combined in analysis pipelines to interrogate different types of next-generation sequencing data. Additionally to the presented exemplary route, we also list a number of alternative tools that can be combined in a mix-and-match fashion.

Aging causes a rise in mitochondrial abnormalities which leads to structural and functional modifications in neuronal activity and cell death in PD. This ends in deterioration of mitochondrial function, mitochondrial alterations, mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA CN) and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) capacity. mtDNA levels or mtDNA CN in PD have reported that mtDNA depletion would be a predisposing factor in PD pathogenesis. To maintain the mtDNA levels, therapeutic approaches have been focused on mitochondrial biogenesis in PD. The depletion of mtDNA levels in PD can be influenced by autophagic dysregulation, apoptosis, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, sirtuins, and calcium homeostasis. The current review describes the regulation of mtDNA levels and discusses the plausible molecular pathways in mtDNA CN depletion in PD pathogenesis. We conclude by suggesting further research on mtDNA depletion which might show a promising effect in predicting and diagnosing PD.© 2023.

Nonetheless, more evidence is needed to understand the impact of genetic variations on antidepressant response. In this study, individual data from 13 clinical studies of European and East Asian ancestry populations were collected. The antidepressant response was clinically assessed as remission and percentage improvement. Imputed genotype was used to translate genetic polymorphisms to four metabolic phenotypes (poor, intermediate, normal, and ultrarapid) of CYP2C19 and CYP2D6. The association of CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 metabolic phenotypes with treatment response was examined using normal metabolizers as the reference. Among 5843 depression patients, a higher remission rate was found in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers compared to normal metabolizers at nominal significance (OR = 1.46, 95% CI [1.03, 2.06], p = 0.033) but did not survive after multiple testing correction. No metabolic phenotype was associated with percentage improvement from baseline. After stratifying by antidepressants primarily metabolized by CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, no association was found between metabolic phenotypes and antidepressant response. Metabolic phenotypes showed differences in frequency, but not effect, between European and East Asian studies. In conclusion, metabolic phenotypes imputed from genetic variants were not associated with antidepressant response. CYP2C19 poor metabolizers could potentially contribute to antidepressant efficacy with more evidence needed. Information including side effects, antidepressant dosage, as well as population from different ancestries could be involved to fully capture the influence of metabolic phenotypes and improve the power of effect assessment."

This study compares the telomere length (TL) in 4-year-old Brahman cows grouped by the first parity (n = 8) and the second parity (n = 11). The cows were bled via jugular venipuncture, weighed, and had their body condition scores recorded at Day -28 prior to calving and at Day + 7 and Day + 28 post-calving. The duration of labor (Dlabor) and parturition ease were recorded. The peripheral leukocytes were isolated, the leukocyte blood count with differential was recorded, and the genomic DNA was extracted. The relative quantity of telomere products, which is proportional to the average TL, was determined via multiplex quantitative PCR using the ratio (T/S ratio) of bovine telomere and β-globulin DNA. Standards of the bovine telomere (1012-107dilution series) and β-globulin (109-104dilution series) genes were utilized to produce relative copy numbers. The samples were assayed in triplicate and were included if the triplicate Cqdifference was less than 0.25 cycles. The parity was the fixed effect, and the random effects included the sire and day repeated with the cow as the subject. Statistical significance was not observed in the leukocyte number or type (p> 0.1). A reduction in the TL of approximately 9225 telomeric copies was found between Parity 1 and Parity 2 (p= 0.02). A trend was found between the TL and Dlabor (p= 0.06). The stress of parturition and raising the first calf of a cow's life may be responsible for TL attenuation. Parity may be considered a stressor of cow longevity."

The convenience of having a reliable remote collection device for blood tests will facilitate access to precision medicine and healthcare. Herein, we tested a 60-biomarker health surveillance panel (HSP), containing 35 FDA/LDT assays and covering at least 14 pathological states, on 8 healthy individuals' ability to collect their own capillary blood from a lancet finger prick and directly compared it to the traditional phlebotomist venous blood and plasma collection methods. All samples were spiked with 114 stable-isotope-labeled (SIL) HSP peptides and quantitatively analyzed by liquid chromatography-multiple reaction monitoring-mass spectrometry (LC/MRM-MS) scheduled method targeting 466 transitions from 114 HSP peptides and by a discovery data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) method. The average peak area ratio (PAR) of the HSP quantifier peptide transitions from all 8 volunteers' capillary blood (n= 48), venous blood (n= 48), and matched plasma (n= 24) was <20% coefficients of variation (CV). Heat map analysis of all 8 volunteers demonstrated that each individual had a unique biosignature. Biological replicates from capillary blood and venous blood clustered within each volunteer ink-means clustering analysis. Pearson statistical analysis of the three biofluids indicated that there was >90% similarity. Discovery DIA-MS analysis of the same samples using a plasma spectral library and a pan-human spectral library identified 1121 and 4661 total proteins, respectively. In addition, at least 122 FDA-approved biomarkers were identified. DIA-MS analysis reproducibly quantitated (<30% CV) ∼600-700 proteins in capillary blood, ∼800 proteins in venous blood, and ∼300-400 proteins in plasma, demonstrating that an expansive biomarker panel is possible with current mass spectrometry technology.

This review aims to study the effects of teratogen exposure in utero on vascular dysfunction in offspring and consider mediators and pathways originating from the fetal environment. (2) Methods: Eligible studies were identified in the PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases. After the full-text screening, 20 articles were included in the narrative synthesis. (3) Results: The literature presents evidence supporting the detrimental effects of fetal exposure to tobacco smoking on vascular alterations in both human and animal studies. Alcohol exposure impaired endothelial dilation in animal studies, but human studies on both tobacco and alcohol exposure are still sparse. Reduction in nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and alterations in the epigenome in infants through the upregulation of pro-oxidative and proinflammatory genes may be the common denominators. (4) Conclusion: While maternal smoking and alcohol consumption have more negative outcomes on the infant in the short term, several factors during the first few years of life may mediate the development of vascular dysfunction. Therefore, more prospective studies are needed to ascertain the long-term effects of teratogen exposure, specifically in South Africa."
"37404565","Effects of the loss of maternal gut microbiota before pregnancy on gut microbiota, food allergy susceptibility, and epigenetic modification on subsequent generations.","Biosci Microbiota Food Health","Maternal environments affect the health of offspring in later life. Changes in epigenetic modifications may partially explain this phenomenon. The gut microbiota is a critical environmental factor that influences epigenetic modifications of host immune cells and the development of food allergies. However, whether changes in the maternal gut microbiota affect the development of food allergies and related epigenetic modifications in subsequent generations remains unclear. Here, we investigated the effects of antibiotic treatment before pregnancy on the development of the gut microbiota, food allergies, and epigenetic modifications in F1 and F2 mice. We found that pre-conception antibiotic treatment affected the gut microbiota composition in F1 but not F2 offspring. F1 mice born to antibiotic-treated mothers had a lower proportion of butyric acid-producing bacteria and, consequently, a lower butyric acid concentration in their cecal contents. The methylation level in the DNA of intestinal lamina propria lymphocytes, food allergy susceptibility, and production of antigen-specific IgE in the F1 and F2 mice were not different between those born to control and antibiotic-treated mothers. In addition, F1 mice born to antibiotic-treated mothers showed increased fecal excretion related to the stress response in a novel environment. These results suggest that the maternal gut microbiota is effectively passed onto F1 offspring but has little effect on food allergy susceptibility or DNA methylation levels in offspring.©2023 BMFH Press."

In patients with AML, highstefin/cystatingene expression correlates with poor clinical outcomes. Increased expression of the clusteredstefin/cystatingenes was associated with a heterochromatin-to-euchromatin compartment switch with readthrough transcription downstream of the clusteredstefin/cystatingenes as well as other highly expressed genes, but only minor changes in DNA methylation. Our data highlight roles for TET enzymes that are distinct from their established function in DNA demethylation and instead involve increased transcriptional readthrough and changes in three-dimensional genome organization."

Here, we demonstrate that the histone demethylase KDM6A promotes infection of diverse coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) in a demethylase activity-independent manner. Mechanistic studies reveal that KDM6A promotes viral entry by regulating expression of multiple coronavirus receptors, including ACE2, DPP4 and Ceacam1. Importantly, the TPR domain of KDM6A is required for recruitment of the histone methyltransferase KMT2D and histone deacetylase p300. Together this KDM6A-KMT2D-p300 complex localizes to the proximal and distal enhancers of ACE2 and regulates receptor expression. Notably, small molecule inhibition of p300 catalytic activity abrogates ACE2 and DPP4 expression and confers resistance to all major SARS-CoV-2 variants and MERS-CoV in primary human airway and intestinal epithelial cells. These data highlight the role for KDM6A-KMT2D-p300 complex activities in conferring diverse coronaviruses susceptibility and reveal a potential pan-coronavirus therapeutic target to combat current and emerging coronaviruses. One Sentence Summary: The KDM6A/KMT2D/EP300 axis promotes expression of multiple viral receptors and represents a potential drug target for diverse coronaviruses.Copyright: © 2023 Wei et al.

"37332562","Evaluation of software impact designed for biomedical research: Are we measuring what's meaningful?","ArXiv","Software is vital for the advancement of biology and medicine. Analysis of usage and impact metrics can help developers determine user and community engagement, justify additional funding, encourage additional use, identify unanticipated use cases, and help define improvement areas. However, there are challenges associated with these analyses including distorted or misleading metrics, as well as ethical and security concerns. More attention to the nuances involved in capturing impact across the spectrum of biological software is needed. Furthermore, some tools may be especially beneficial to a small audience, yet may not have compelling typical usage metrics. We propose more general guidelines, as well as strategies for more specific types of software. We highlight outstanding issues regarding how communities measure or evaluate software impact. To get a deeper understanding of current practices for software evaluations, we performed a survey of participants in the Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR) program funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). We also investigated software among this community and others to assess how often infrastructure that supports such evaluations is implemented and how this impacts rates of papers describing usage of the software. We find that developers recognize the utility of analyzing software usage, but struggle to find the time or funding for such analyses. We also find that infrastructure such as social media presence, more in-depth documentation, the presence of software health metrics, and clear information on how to contact developers seem to be associated with increased usage rates. Our findings can help scientific software developers make the most out of evaluations of their software."
"37511900","Maternal Age at Menarche Gene Polymorphisms Are Associated with Offspring Birth Weight.","Life (Basel)","In this study, the association between maternal age at menarche (AAM)-related polymorphisms and offspring birth weight (BW) was studied. The work was performed on a sample of 716 pregnant women and their newborns. All pregnant women underwent genotyping of 50 SNPs of AAM candidate genes. Regression methods (linear and Model-Based Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MB-MDR)) with permutation procedures (the indicator ppermwas calculated) were used to identify the correlation between SNPs and newborn weight (transformed BW values were analyzed) and in silico bioinformatic examination was applied to assess the intended functionality of BW-associated loci. Four AAM-related genetic variants were BW-associated including genes such asPOMC(rs7589318) (βadditive= 0.202/pperm= 0.015),KDM3B(rs757647) (βrecessive= 0.323/pperm= 0.005),INHBA(rs1079866) (βadditive= 0.110/pperm= 0.014) andNKX2-1(rs999460) (βrecessive= -0.176/pperm= 0.015). Ten BW-significant models of interSNPs interactions (pperm≤ 0.001) were identified for 20 polymorphisms. SNPs rs7538038KISS1, rs713586RBJ, rs12324955FTOand rs713586RBJ-rs12324955FTOtwo-locus interaction were included in the largest number of BW-associated models (30% models each). BW-associated AAM-linked 22 SNPs and 350 proxy loci were functionally related to 49 genes relevant to pathways such as the hormone biosynthesis/process and female/male gonad development. In conclusion, maternal AMM-related genes polymorphism is associated with the offspring BW."

A bi-allelic polymorphism in the promoter region, at position -308 (G/A) of theTNF-αgene (rs1800629) is associated with an increased TNF-a production. However, several previous association studies ofTNF-αG-308A polymorphism and IgAN rendered contradictory findings. The objective of the present study is to shed light on these inconclusive results and clarify the role of TNF-α and any possible contribution of this factor in the development and progression of sporadic IgAN. Therefore, a meta-analysis of all available genetic association studies relating theTNF-αG-308A polymorphism to the risk for development and/or progression of IgAN was conducted. Seven studies were included in the meta-analysis. Three of them included populations of European descent (Caucasians) and four involved Asians. The generalized odds ratio (ORG) was used to estimate the risk for the development and/or progression of the disease. Overall, the meta-analysis did not detect any significant association between the G-308A variant and both the risk of developing IgAN and the risk for progression of IgAN. In conclusion, these results suggest thatTNF-αdoes not constitute a key component in the genetic architecture of sporadic IgAN. However, further evidence deciphering the influence ofTNF-αon IgAN is still needed."
"37495751","Tutorial: a statistical genetics guide to identifying HLA alleles driving complex disease.","Nat Protoc","The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus is associated with more complex diseases than any other locus in the human genome. In many diseases, HLA explains more heritability than all other known loci combined. In silico HLA imputation methods enable rapid and accurate estimation of HLA alleles in the millions of individuals that are already genotyped on microarrays. HLA imputation has been used to define causal variation in autoimmune diseases, such as type I diabetes, and in human immunodeficiency virus infection control. However, there are few guidelines on performing HLA imputation, association testing, and fine mapping. Here, we present a comprehensive tutorial to impute HLA alleles from genotype data. We provide detailed guidance on performing standard quality control measures for input genotyping data and describe options to impute HLA alleles and amino acids either locally or using the web-based Michigan Imputation Server, which hosts a multi-ancestry HLA imputation reference panel. We also offer best practice recommendations to conduct association tests to define the alleles, amino acids, and haplotypes that affect human traits. Along with the pipeline, we provide a step-by-step online guide with scripts and available software ( https://github.com/immunogenomics/HLA_analyses_tutorial ). This tutorial will be broadly applicable to large-scale genotyping data and will contribute to defining the role of HLA in human diseases across global populations.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."
"37475089","Characterizing the polygenic architecture of complex traits in populations of East Asian and European descent.","Hum Genomics","To investigate the polygenicity of complex traits in populations of East Asian (EAS) and European (EUR) descents, we leveraged genome-wide data from Biobank Japan, UK Biobank, and FinnGen cohorts. Specifically, we analyzed up to 215 outcomes related to 18 health domains, assessing their polygenic architecture via descriptive statistics, such as the proportion of susceptibility SNPs per trait (πc). While we did not observe EAS-EUR differences in the overall distribution of polygenicity parameters across the phenotypes investigated, there were ancestry-specific patterns in the polygenicity differences between health domains. In EAS, pairwise comparisons across health domains showed enrichment for πcdifferences related to hematological and metabolic traits (hematological fold-enrichment = 4.45, p = 2.15 × 10-7; metabolic fold-enrichment = 4.05, p = 4.01 × 10-6). For both categories, the proportion of susceptibility SNPs was lower than that observed for several other health domains (EAS-hematological median πc = 0.15%, EAS-metabolic median πc = 0.18%) with the strongest πcdifference with respect to respiratory traits (EAS-respiratory median πc = 0.50%; hematological-p = 2.26 × 10-3; metabolic-p = 3.48 × 10-3). In EUR, pairwise comparisons showed multiple πcdifferences related to the endocrine category (fold-enrichment = 5.83, p = 4.76 × 10-6), where these traits showed a low proportion of susceptibility SNPs (EUR-endocrine median πc = 0.01%) with the strongest difference with respect to psychiatric phenotypes (EUR-psychiatric median πc = 0.50%; p = 1.19 × 10-4). Simulating sample sizes of 1,000,000 and 5,000,000 individuals, we also showed that ancestry-specific polygenicity patterns translate into differences across health domains in the genetic variance explained by susceptibility SNPs projected to be genome-wide significant (e.g., EAS hematological-neoplasm p = 2.18 × 10-4; EUR endocrine-gastrointestinal p = 6.80 × 10-4). These findings highlight that traits related to the same health domains may present ancestry-specific variability in their polygenicity.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37461612","TRPS1 modulates chromatin accessibility to regulate estrogen receptor (ER) binding and ER target gene expression in luminal breast cancer cells.","bioRxiv","Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women. The most common subtype is luminal breast cancer, which is typically driven by the estrogen receptorα(ER), a transcription factor (TF) that activates many genes required for proliferation. Multiple effective therapies target this path-way, but individuals often develop resistance. Thus, there is a need to identify additional targets that regulate ER activity and contribute to breast tumor progression. TRPS1 is a repressive GATA-family TF that is overexpressed in breast tumors. Common genetic variants in the TRPS1 locus are associated with breast cancer risk, and luminal breast cancer cell lines are particularly sensitive to TRPS1 knockout. However, we do not know how TRPS1 regulates target genes to mediate these breast cancer patient and cellular outcomes. We introduced an inducible degron tag into the native TRPS1 locus within a luminal breast cancer cell line to identify the direct targets of TRPS1 and determine how TRPS1 mechanistically regulates gene expression. We acutely deplete over eighty percent of TRPS1 from chromatin within 30 minutes of inducing degradation. We find that TRPS1 regulates transcription of hundreds of genes, including those related to estrogen signaling. TRPS1 directly regulates chromatin structure, which causes ER to redistribute in the genome. ER redistribution leads to both repression and activation of dozens of ER target genes. Downstream from these primary effects, TRPS1 depletion represses cell cycle-related gene sets and reduces cell doubling rate. Finally, we show that high TRPS1 activity, calculated using a gene expression signature defined by primary TRPS1-regulated genes, is associated with worse breast cancer patient prognosis. Taken together, these data suggest a model in which TRPS1 modulates the activity of other TFs, both activating and repressing transcription of genes related to cancer cell fitness."
"37438615","Genetics of SLE: mechanistic insights from monogenic disease and disease-associated variants.","Nat Rev Nephrol","The past few years have provided important insights into the genetic architecture of systemic autoimmunity through aggregation of findings from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing studies. In the prototypic systemic autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), monogenic disease accounts for a small fraction of cases but has been instrumental in the elucidation of disease mechanisms. Defects in the clearance or digestion of extracellular or intracellular DNA or RNA lead to increased sensing of nucleic acids, which can break B cell tolerance and induce the production of type I interferons leading to tissue damage. Current data suggest that multiple GWAS SLE risk alleles act in concert with rare functional variants to promote SLE development. Moreover, introduction of orthologous variant alleles into mice has revealed that pathogenic X-linked dominant and recessive SLE can be caused by novel variants in TLR7 and SAT1, respectively. Such bespoke models of disease help to unravel pathogenic pathways and can be used to test targeted therapies. Cell type-specific expression data revealed that most GWAS SLE risk genes are highly expressed in age-associated B cells (ABCs), which supports the view that ABCs produce lupus autoantibodies and contribute to end-organ damage by persisting in inflamed tissues, including the kidneys. ABCs have thus emerged as key targets of promising precision therapeutics.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."

Prior studies have developed genome-wide polygenic scores to enable risk stratification, reflecting the substantial inherited component to CAD risk. Here we develop a new and significantly improved polygenic score for CAD, termed GPSMult, that incorporates genome-wide association data across five ancestries for CAD (>269,000 cases and >1,178,000 controls) and ten CAD risk factors. GPSMultstrongly associated with prevalent CAD (odds ratio per standard deviation 2.14, 95% confidence interval 2.10-2.19, P < 0.001) in UK Biobank participants of European ancestry, identifying 20.0% of the population with 3-fold increased risk and conversely 13.9% with 3-fold decreased risk as compared with those in the middle quintile. GPSMultwas also associated with incident CAD events (hazard ratio per standard deviation 1.73, 95% confidence interval 1.70-1.76, P < 0.001), identifying 3% of healthy individuals with risk of future CAD events equivalent to those with existing disease and significantly improving risk discrimination and reclassification. Across multiethnic, external validation datasets inclusive of 33,096, 124,467, 16,433 and 16,874 participants of African, European, Hispanic and South Asian ancestry, respectively, GPSMultdemonstrated increased strength of associations across all ancestries and outperformed all available previously published CAD polygenic scores. These data contribute a new GPSMultfor CAD to the field and provide a generalizable framework for how large-scale integration of genetic association data for CAD and related traits from diverse populations can meaningfully improve polygenic risk prediction.© 2023.

"37404740","Identification of potential drug targets for varicose veins: a Mendelian randomization analysis.","Front Cardiovasc Med","Varicose veins are a common chronic disease that creates a significant economic burden on the healthcare system. Current treatment options, including pharmacological treatments, are not always effective, and there is a need for more targeted therapies. A Mendelian randomization (MR) method uses genetic variants as instrumental variables to estimate the causal effect of an exposure on an outcome, and it has been successful in identifying therapeutic targets in other diseases. However, few studies have used MR to explore potential protein drug targets for varicose veins.To identify potential drug targets for varicose veins of lower extremities, we undertook a comprehensive screen of plasma protein with a two-sample MR method. We used recently reportedcis-variants as genetic instruments of 2,004 plasma proteins, then applied MR to a recent meta-analysis of genome-wide association study on varicose veins (22,037 cases and 437,665 controls). Furthermore, pleiotropy detection, reverse causality testing, colocalization analysis, and external replication were utilized to strengthen the causal effects of prioritized proteins. Phenome-wide MR (PheW-MR) of the prioritized proteins for the risk of 525 diseases was conducted to screen potential side effects.We identified eight plasma proteins that are significantly associated with the risk of varicose veins after Bonferroni correction (P < 2.495 × 10-5), with five being protective (LUM, POSTN, RPN1, RSPO3, and VAT1) and three harmful (COLEC11, IRF3, and SARS2). Most identified proteins showed no pleiotropic effects except for COLLEC11. Bidirectional MR and MR Steiger testing excluded reverse causal relationship between varicose veins and prioritized proteins. The colocalization analysis indicated that COLEC11, IRF3, LUM, POSTN, RSPO3, and SARS2 shared the same causal variant with varicose veins. Finally, seven identified proteins replicated with alternative instruments except for VAT1. Furthermore, PheW-MR revealed that only IRF3 had potential harmful adverse side effects.We identified eight potential causal proteins for varicose veins with MR. A comprehensive analysis indicated that IRF3, LUM, POSTN, RSPO3, and SARS2 might be potential drug targets for varicose veins.© 2023 Lin, Zhou, Liu, Zeng, Wang, Li, Cui and Zheng."

The aims of this study were to evaluate the genetic diversity and genomewide selection signatures in four indigenous Iranian horse breeds. We evaluated 169 horses from Caspian (n = 21), Turkmen (n = 29), Kurdish (n = 67), and Persian Arabian (n = 52) populations, using genomewide genotyping data. The contemporary effective population sizes were 59, 98, 102, and 113 for Turkmen, Caspian, Persian Arabian, and Kurdish breeds, respectively. By analysis of the population genetic structure, we classified the north breeds (Caspian and Turkmen) and west/southwest breeds (Persian Arabian and Kurdish) into two phylogeographic clades reflecting their geographic origin. Using the de-correlated composite of multiple selection signal statistics based on pairwise comparisons, we detected a different number of significant SNPs under putative selection from 13 to 28 for the six pairwise comparisons (FDR < 0.05). The identified SNPs under putative selection coincided with genes previously associated with known QTLs for morphological, adaptation, and fitness traits. Our results showed HMGA2 and LLPH as strong candidate genes for height variation between Caspian horses with a small size and the other studied breeds with a medium size. Using the results of studies on human height retrieved from the GWAS catalog, we suggested 38 new putative candidate genes under selection. These results provide a genomewide map of selection signatures in the studied breeds, which represent valuable information for formulating genetic conservation and improved breeding strategies for the breeds.© 2023.

We performed methylome sequencing on 111,180 immune cells obtained from 112 individuals who were exposed to different viruses, bacteria, or chemicals. Our analysis revealed 790,662 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with these exposures, which are mostly individual CpG sites. Additionally, we integrated methylation and ATAC-seq data from same samples and found strong correlations between the two modalities. However, the epigenomic remodeling in these two modalities are complementary. Finally, we identified the minimum set of DMRs that can predict exposures. Overall, our study provides the first comprehensive dataset of single immune cell methylation profiles, along with unique methylation biomarkers for various biological and chemical exposures."

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a predominant cause of cirrhosis, which is a global indicator of liver transplantation and is considered the hepatic manifestation of MetS. FibroScan®provides an accurate and non-invasive method for assessing liver steatosis and fibrosis in patients with NAFLD, via a controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) and liver stiffness measurement (LSM or E) scores and has been widely used in current clinical practice. Several machine learning (ML) models with a recursive feature elimination (RFE) algorithm were applied to evaluate the importance of the CAP score. Analysis by ANOVA revealed that five symptoms at different CAP and E score levels were significant. All eight ML models had accuracy scores > 0.9, while treebags and random forest had the best kappa values (0.6439 and 0.6533, respectively). The CAP score was the most important variable in the seven ML models. Machine learning models with RFE demonstrated that using the CAP score to identify patients with MetS may be feasible. Thus, a combination of CAP scores and other significant biomarkers could be used for early detection in predicting MetS."

Diagnosis can be difficult due to the heterogeneity and non-specific nature of the initial symptoms, resulting in delays that compromise prompt access to effective therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome profiling of patient-derived peripheral cells represents a valuable benchmark in overcoming such challenges, providing the opportunity to identify molecular diagnostic signatures. In this study, we characterized transcriptome changes in skin fibroblasts of sporadic ALS patients (sALS) and controls and evaluated their utility as a molecular classifier for ALS diagnosis. Our analysis identified 277 differentially expressed transcripts predominantly involved in transcriptional regulation, synaptic transmission, and the inflammatory response. A support vector machine classifier based on this 277-gene signature was developed to discriminate patients with sALS from controls, showing significant predictive power in both the discovery dataset and in six independent publicly available gene expression datasets obtained from different sALS tissue/cell samples. Taken together, our findings support the utility of transcriptional signatures in peripheral cells as valuable biomarkers for the diagnosis of ALS."

In order to predict the Ki-67 expression status and the GS in PCa, we sought to construct and verify MRI-based radiomics signatures.We collected T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) images from 170 PCa patients at three institutions and extracted 321 original radiomic features from each image modality. We used support vector machine (SVM) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression to select the most informative radiomic features and built predictive models using up sampling and feature selection techniques. Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, the discriminating power of this feature was determined. Subsequent decision curve analysis (DCA) assessed the clinical utility of the radiomic features. The Kaplan-Meier (KM) test revealed that the radiomics-predicted Ki-67 expression status and GS were prognostic factors for PCa survival.The hypothesized radiomics signature, which included 15 and 9 selected radiomics features, respectively, was significantly correlated with pathological Ki-67 and GS outcomes in both the training and validation datasets. Areas under the curve (AUC) for the developed model were 0.813 (95% CI 0.681,0.930) and 0.793 (95% CI 0.621, 0.929) for the training and validation datasets, respectively, demonstrating discrimination and calibration performance. The model's clinical usefulness was verified using DCA. In both the training and validation sets, high Ki-67 expression and high GS predicted by radiomics using SVM models were substantially linked with poor overall survival (OS).Both Ki-67 expression status and high GS correlate with PCa patient survival outcomes; therefore, the ability of the SVM classifier-based model to estimate Ki-67 expression status and the Lasso classifier-based model to assess high GS may enhance clinical decision-making.© 2023.

The predictive performance was analyzed by comparing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AU-ROC) of ML models to that of conventional severity-of-illness scoring systems. Three ML models were evaluated: (1) logistic regression with L2 regularization, (2) gradient-boosted decision tree (LightGBM), and (3) multilayer perceptron (MLP). Among the 816 pneumonia patients included, 223 (27.3%) patients died. All ML models significantly outperformed the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (AU-ROC: 0.650 [0.584-0.716] vs 0.820 [0.771-0.869] for logistic regression vs 0.827 [0.777-0.876] for LightGBM 0.838 [0.791-0.884] for MLP; P < 0.001). In the analysis for NRI, the LightGBM and MLP models showed superior reclassification compared with the logistic regression model in predicting in-ICU mortality in all length of stay in the ICU subgroups; all age subgroups; all subgroups with any APACHE II score, PaO2/FiO2ratio < 200; all subgroups with or without history of respiratory disease; with or without history of CVA or dementia; treatment with mechanical ventilation, and use of inotropic agents. In conclusion, the ML models have excellent performance in predicting in-ICU mortality in patients with severe pneumonia. Moreover, this study highlights the potential advantages of selecting individual ML models for predicting in-ICU mortality in different subgroups.© 2023. The Author(s)."

This study aims to determine the accuracy of a pre-trained lab-based machine learning model (MLM) to distinguish functional from non-functional arm movements in a home situation in BCS. (2) Methods: Participants performed four daily life activities while wearing two wrist accelerometers and being video recorded. To define UL functioning, video data were annotated and accelerometer data were analyzed using a counts threshold method and an MLM. Prediction accuracy, recall, sensitivity, f1-score, 'total minutes functional activity' and 'percentage functionally active' were considered. (3) Results: Despite a good MLM accuracy (0.77-0.90), recall, and specificity, the f1-score was poor. An overestimation of the 'total minutes functional activity' and 'percentage functionally active' was found by the MLM. Between the video-annotated data and the functional activity determined by the MLM, the mean differences were 0.14% and 0.10% for the left and right side, respectively. For the video-annotated data versus the counts threshold method, the mean differences were 0.27% and 0.24%, respectively.

More useful biomarkers for diagnosing AD and reflecting the disease progression are in need and of significance.The integrated bioinformatic analysis combined with machine-learning strategies was applied for exploring crucial functional pathways and identifying diagnostic biomarkers of AD. Four datasets (GSE5281, GSE131617, GSE48350, and GSE84422) with samples of AD frontal cortex are integrated as experimental datasets, and another two datasets (GSE33000 and GSE44772) with samples of AD frontal cortex were used to perform validation analyses. Functional Correlation enrichment analyses were conducted based on Gene ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and the Reactome database to reveal AD-associated biological functions and key pathways. Four models were employed to screen the potential diagnostic biomarkers, including one bioinformatic analysis of Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA)and three machine-learning algorithms: Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) and random forest (RF) analysis. The correlation analysis was performed to explore the correlation between the identified biomarkers with CDR scores and Braak staging.The pathways of the immune response and oxidative stress were identified as playing a crucial role during AD. Thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP), early growth response 1 (EGR1), and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5 (IGFBP5) were screened as diagnostic markers of AD. The diagnostic efficacy of TXNIP, EGR1, and IGFBP5 was validated with corresponding AUCs of 0.857, 0.888, and 0.856 in dataset GSE33000, 0.867, 0.909, and 0.841 in dataset GSE44770.

Accurate prognostication and the successful application of emerging precision medicine in glioblastoma relies upon the resolution and exactitude of classification. We discuss limitations of our current classification systems and their inability to capture the full heterogeneity of the disease. We review the various layers of data that are available to substratify glioblastoma and we discuss how artificial intelligence and machine learning tools provide the opportunity to organize and integrate this data in a nuanced way. In doing so there is the potential to generate clinically relevant disease sub-stratifications, which could help predict neuro-oncological patient outcomes with greater certainty. We discuss limitations of this approach and how these might be overcome. The development of a comprehensive unified classification of glioblastoma would be a major advance in the field. This will require the fusion of advances in understanding glioblastoma biology with technological innovation in data processing and organization.Copyright © 2023 Hill and Pandit."
"37424799","Visualized machine learning models combined with propensity score matching analysis in single PR-positive breast cancer prognosis: a multicenter population-based study.","Am J Cancer Res","The characteristics of single PR-positive (ER-PR+, sPR+) breast cancer (BC) and its prognosis are not well elucidated due to its rarity and conflicting evidence. There is a lack of an accurate and efficient model for predicting survival, thereby rendering treatment challenging for clinicians. Whether endocrine therapy should be intensified in sPR+ BC patients was another controversial clinical topic. We constructed and cross-validated XGBoost models that showed high precision and accuracy in predicting the survival of patients with sPR+ BC cases (1-year: AUC=0.904; 3-year: AUC=0.847; 5-year: AUC=0.824). The F1 score for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year models were 0.91, 0.88, and 0.85, respectively. The models exhibited superior performance in an external, independent dataset (1-year: AUC=0.889; 3-year: AUC=0.846; 5-year: AUC=0.821). Further, intensified endocrine therapy did not provide a significant overall survival benefit compared to initial or no endocrine therapy (P=0.600, HR: 1.46; 95% CI: 0.35-6.17). Propensity-score matching (PSM)-adjusted data showed that there was no statistically significant difference in the prognosis between ER-PR+HER2+ and ER-PR-HER2+ BC. Patients having the ER-PR+HER2- subtype had a slightly worse prognosis than those with the ER-PR-HER2- subtype. In conclusion, XGBoost models can be highly reproducible and effective in predicting survival in patients with sPR+ BC. Our findings revealed that patients with sPR-positive BC may not benefit from endocrine therapy. Patients with sPR+ BC may benefit from intensive adjuvant chemotherapy compared to endocrine therapy.AJCR Copyright © 2023."
"37420249","Mutation-Attention (MuAt): deep representation learning of somatic mutations for tumour typing and subtyping.","Genome Med","Cancer genome sequencing enables accurate classification of tumours and tumour subtypes. However, prediction performance is still limited using exome-only sequencing and for tumour types with low somatic mutation burden such as many paediatric tumours. Moreover, the ability to leverage deep representation learning in discovery of tumour entities remains unknown.We introduce here Mutation-Attention (MuAt), a deep neural network to learn representations of simple and complex somatic alterations for prediction of tumour types and subtypes. In contrast to many previous methods, MuAt utilizes the attention mechanism on individual mutations instead of aggregated mutation counts.We trained MuAt models on 2587 whole cancer genomes (24 tumour types) from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) and 7352 cancer exomes (20 types) from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). MuAt achieved prediction accuracy of 89% for whole genomes and 64% for whole exomes, and a top-5 accuracy of 97% and 90%, respectively. MuAt models were found to be well-calibrated and perform well in three independent whole cancer genome cohorts with 10,361 tumours in total. We show MuAt to be able to learn clinically and biologically relevant tumour entities including acral melanoma, SHH-activated medulloblastoma, SPOP-associated prostate cancer, microsatellite instability, POLE proofreading deficiency, and MUTYH-associated pancreatic endocrine tumours without these tumour subtypes and subgroups being provided as training labels. Finally, scrunity of MuAt attention matrices revealed both ubiquitous and tumour-type specific patterns of simple and complex somatic mutations.Integrated representations of somatic alterations learnt by MuAt were able to accurately identify histological tumour types and identify tumour entities, with potential to impact precision cancer medicine.© 2023.

Data-driven identification of expression biomarkers coupled with microfluidics-based detection shows promise to revolutionize cancer diagnosis and prognosis. MicroRNAs play key roles in cancers and afford detection in tissue and liquid biopsies. In this review, we focus on the microfluidics-based detection of miRNA biomarkers in AI-based models for early-stage cancer subtyping and prognosis. We describe various subclasses of miRNA biomarkers that could be useful in machine-based predictive modeling of cancer staging and progression. Strategies for optimizing the feature space of miRNA biomarkers are necessary to obtain a robust signature panel. This is followed by a discussion of the issues in model construction and validation towards producing Software-as-Medical-Devices (SaMDs). Microfluidic devices could facilitate the multiplexed detection of miRNA biomarker panels, and an overview of the different strategies for designing such microfluidic systems is presented here, with an outline of the detection principles used and the corresponding performance measures. Microfluidics-based profiling of miRNAs coupled with SaMD represent high-performance point-of-care solutions that would aid clinical decision-making and pave the way for accessible precision personalized medicine."

We hypothesized that the co-occurrences of diseases and their overlapping genetic etiology can be exploited to simultaneously improve multiple diseases' polygenic risk scores (PRS). This hypothesis was tested using a multi-task learning (MTL) approach based on an explainable neural network architecture. We found that parallel estimations of the PRS for 17 prevalent cancers in a pan-cancer MTL model were generally more accurate than independent estimations for individual cancers in comparable single-task learning (STL) models. Such performance improvement conferred by positive transfer learning was also observed consistently for 60 prevalent non-cancer diseases in a pan-disease MTL model. Interpretation of the MTL models revealed significant genetic correlations between the important sets of single nucleotide polymorphisms used by the neural network for PRS estimation. This suggested a well-connected network of diseases with shared genetic basis.Copyright: © 2023 Badré, Pan.

"37498390","The benefits and pitfalls of machine learning for biomarker discovery.","Cell Tissue Res","Prospects for the discovery of robust and reproducible biomarkers have improved considerably with the development of sensitive omics platforms that can enable measurement of biological molecules at an unprecedented scale. With technical barriers to success lowering, the challenge is now moving into the analytical domain. Genome-wide discovery presents a problem of scale and multiple testing as standard statistical methods struggle to distinguish signal from noise in increasingly complex biological systems. Machine learning and AI methods are good at finding answers in large datasets, but they have a tendency to overfit solutions. It may be possible to find a local answer or mechanism in a specific patient sample or small group of samples, but this may not generalise to wider patient populations due to the high likelihood of false discovery. The rise of explainable AI offers to improve the opportunity for true discovery by providing explanations for predictions that can be explored mechanistically before proceeding to costly and time-consuming validation studies. This review aims to introduce some of the basic concepts of machine learning and AI for biomarker discovery with a focus on post hoc explanation of predictions. To illustrate this, we consider how explainable AI has already been used successfully, and we explore a case study that applies AI to biomarker discovery in rheumatoid arthritis, demonstrating the accessibility of tools for AI and machine learning. We use this to illustrate and discuss some of the potential challenges and solutions that may enable AI to critically interrogate disease and response mechanisms.© 2023. The Author(s)."

We previously reported that single nucleotide polymorphisms spanning chromosome 3p21.1 showed significant associations with both schizophrenia and BD, and a risk SNP rs2251219 was in linkage disequilibrium with a human specific Alu polymorphism rs71052682, which showed enhancer effects on transcriptional activities using luciferase reporter assays in U251 and U87MG cells.CRISPR/Cas9-directed genome editing, real-time quantitative PCR, and public Hi-C data were utilized to investigate the correlation between the Alu polymorphism rs71052682 and NISCH. Primary neuronal culture, immunofluorescence staining, co-immunoprecipitation, lentiviral vector production, intracranial stereotaxic injection, behavioral assessment, and drug treatment were used to examine the physiological impacts of Nischarin (encoded by NISCH).Deleting the Alu sequence in U251 and U87MG cells reduced mRNA expression of NISCH, the gene locates 180 kb from rs71052682, and Hi-C data in brain tissues confirmed the extensive chromatin contacts. These data suggested that the genetic risk of schizophrenia and BD predicted elevated NISCH expression, which was also consistent with the observed higher NISCH mRNA levels in the brain tissues from psychiatric patients compared with controls. We then found that overexpression of NISCH resulted in a significantly decreased density of mushroom dendritic spines with a simultaneously increased density of thin dendritic spines in primary cultured neurons. Intriguingly, elevated expression of this gene in mice also led to impaired spatial working memory in the Y-maze. Given that Nischarin is the target of anti-hypertensive agents clonidine and tizanidine, which have shown therapeutic effects in patients with schizophrenia and patients with BD in preliminary clinical trials, we demonstrated that treatment with those antihypertensive drugs could reduce NISCH mRNA expression and rescue the impaired working memory in mice.We identify a psychiatric risk gene NISCH at 3p21.1 GWAS locus influencing dendritic spine morphogenesis and cognitive function, and Nischarin may have potentials for future therapeutic development.© 2023.

"37394919","Chromatin Organization and Transcriptional Programming of Breast Cancer Cell Identity.","Endocrinology","The advent of sequencing technologies for assessing chromosome conformations has provided a wealth of information on the organization of the 3-dimensional genome and its role in cancer progression. It is now known that changes in chromatin folding and accessibility can promote aberrant activation or repression of transcriptional programs that can drive tumorigenesis and progression in diverse cancers. This includes breast cancer, which comprises several distinct subtypes defined by their unique transcriptomes that dictate treatment response and patient outcomes. Of these, basal-like breast cancer is an aggressive subtype controlled by a pluripotency-enforcing transcriptome. Meanwhile, the more differentiated luminal subtype of breast cancer is driven by an estrogen receptor-dominated transcriptome that underlies its responsiveness to antihormone therapies and conveys improved patient outcomes. Despite the clear differences in molecular signatures, the genesis of each subtype from normal mammary epithelial cells remains unclear. Recent technical advances have revealed key distinctions in chromatin folding and organization between subtypes that could underlie their transcriptomic and, hence, phenotypic differences. These studies also suggest that proteins controlling particular chromatin states may be useful targets for treating aggressive disease. In this review, we explore the current state of understanding of chromatin architecture in breast cancer subtypes and its potential role in defining their phenotypic characteristics.© The Author(s) 2023.

"37456669","Nanopore long-read next-generation sequencing for detection of mitochondrial DNA large-scale deletions.","Front Genet","Primary mitochondrial diseases are progressive genetic disorders affecting multiple organs and characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction. These disorders can be caused by mutations in nuclear genes coding proteins with mitochondrial localization or by genetic defects in the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA). The latter include point pathogenic variants and large-scale deletions/rearrangements. MtDNA molecules with the wild type or a variant sequence can exist together in a single cell, a condition known as mtDNA heteroplasmy. MtDNA single point mutations are typically detected by means of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) based on short reads which, however, are limited for the identification of structural mtDNA alterations. Recently, new NGS technologies based on long reads have been released, allowing to obtain sequences of several kilobases in length; this approach is suitable for detection of structural alterations affecting the mitochondrial genome. In the present work we illustrate the optimization of two sequencing protocols based on long-read Oxford Nanopore Technology to detect mtDNA structural alterations. This approach presents strong advantages in the analysis of mtDNA compared to both short-read NGS and traditional techniques, potentially becoming the method of choice for genetic studies on mtDNA.Copyright © 2023 Frascarelli, Zanetti, Nasca, Izzo, Lamperti, Lamantea, Legati and Ghezzi."

In this study, quantitative proteomics acquired from a mouse model were first analyzed. At the same time, functional pathway analysis helped identify functional pathways at the protein level. Then, bioinformatics on mRNA sequencing data were conducted between sepsis and normal mouse models. Differential expressional genes with the closest relationship to disease status and development were identified through module correlation analysis. Then, common biomarkers in proteomics and transcriptomics were extracted as target biomarkers. Through analyzing expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) and genome-wide association studies (GWAS), colocalization analysis on Apoa2 and sepsis phenotype was conducted by summary-data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR). Then, two-sample and drug-target, syndrome Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were all conducted using the Twosample R package. For protein level, protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) of the target biomarker were also included in MR. Animal experiments helped validate these results. As a result, Apoa2 protein or mRNA was identified as a target biomarker for H2with a protective, causal relationship with sepsis. HDL and type 2 diabetes were proven to possess causal relationships with sepsis. The agitation and inhibition of Apoa2 were indicated to influence sepsis and related syndromes. In conclusion, we first proposed Apoa2 as a target for H2treatment."
"37464031","Biological and functional multimorbidity-from mechanisms to management.","Nat Med","Globally, the number of people with multiple co-occurring diseases will increase substantially over the coming decades, with important consequences for patients, carers, healthcare systems and society. Addressing this challenge requires a shift in the prevailing clinical, educational and scientific thinking and organization-with a strong emphasis on the maintenance of generalist skills to balance the specialization trends of medical education and research. Multimorbidity is not a single entity but differs quantitively and qualitatively across life stages, ethnicities, sexes, socioeconomic groups and geographies. Data-driven science that quantifies the impact of disease co-occurrence-beyond the small number of currently well-studied long-term conditions (such as cardiometabolic diseases)-can help illuminate the pathological diversity of multimorbidity and identify common, mechanistically related, and prognostically relevant clusters. Broader access to data opportunities across modalities and disciplines will catalyze vertical and horizontal integration of multimorbidity research, to enable reconfiguring of medical services, clinical trials, guidelines and research in a way that accounts for the complexity of multimorbidity-and provides efficient, joined-up services for patients.© 2023.

We aimed to identify putative causal proteins and druggable targets of osteoporosis.Methods:This study utilized the largest GWAS summary statistics on plasma proteins and estimated heel BMD (eBMD) to identify causal proteins of osteoporosis by mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Different GWAS datasets were used to validate the results. Multiple sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the robustness of primary MR findings. We have also performed an enrichment analysis for the identified causal proteins and evaluated their druggability.Results:After Bonferroni correction, 67 proteins were identified to be causally associated with estimated BMD (eBMD) (p< 4 × 10-5). We further replicated 38 of the 67 proteins to be associated with total body BMD, lumbar spine BMD, femoral neck BMD as well as fractures, such as RSPO3, IDUA, SMOC2, and LRP4. The findings were supported by sensitivity analyses. Enrichment analysis identified multiple Gene Ontology items, including collagen-containing extracellular matrix (GO:0062023,p= 1.6 × 10-10), collagen binding (GO:0005518,p= 8.6 × 10-5), and extracellular matrix structural constituent (GO:0005201,p= 2.7 × 10-5).Conclusion:The study identified novel putative causal proteins for osteoporosis which may serve as potential early screening biomarkers and druggable targets. Furthermore, the role of plasma proteins involved in collagen binding and extracellular matrix in the development of osteoporosis was highlighted.

Genetic fine-mapping aims to detect independent causal variants from the GWAS-identified loci, adjusting for linkage disequilibrium patterns.We present ""FiniMOM"" (fine-mapping using a product inverse-moment prior), a novel Bayesian fine-mapping method for summarized genetic associations. For causal effects, the method uses a nonlocal inverse-moment prior, which is a natural prior distribution to model non-null effects in finite samples. A beta-binomial prior is set for the number of causal variants, with a parameterization that can be used to control for potential misspecifications in the linkage disequilibrium reference.

We have used material from Norway's National Cod Breeding Program to study how different early life-stage temperature regimes affect DNA methylation and gene expression. Long-term effects were detected by sampling fish several weeks after the end of differential treatments, and offspring from the different exposure groups was also sampled. Many overlapping genes were found between the different exposure groups and generations, coupled with genes associated with differential CpG methylation levels. Genes involved in muscle fibre development, general metabolic processes and formation of deformities were significantly affected, and genes relevant for intergenerational transfer of epigenetic marks were also detected. We believe the use of environmental cues can be a useful strategy for improving the production of Atlantic cod."

One model system that has been particularly useful for studying transgenerational epigenetic inheritance is C. elegans. Their short generation time and hermaphroditic reproduction have allowed multiple transgenerational phenotypes to be identified, including aging, fertility, and behavior. However, it is still not clear how transgenerational epigenetic inheritance from the germline affects embryogenesis. Fortunately, the C. elegans embryo has a unique property that makes it ideal for addressing this question: they develop via an invariant lineage, with each cell undergoing stereotypical cell divisions to adopt the same cell fate in every individual embryo. Because of this invariant cell lineage, automated lineage tracing and single-cell RNA-seq can be employed to determine how transgenerational epigenetic inheritance from the germline affects developmental timing and cell fate. Unfortunately, difficulties with these techniques have severely limited their adoption in the community. Here, we provide a practical guide to automated lineage tracing coupled with single-cell RNA-seq to facilitate their use in studying transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in C. elegans embryos.© 2023.

Although it has been reported that novel allosteric inhibitors such as ZL0590 have a high affinity with target protein BRD4 and good efficacy, their inhibitory mechanism has not been studied further. The aim of this study was to reveal the inhibition mechanism of allosteric inhibitor ZL0590 on Free-BRD4 and BRD4 binding MS436 (orthosteric inhibitor) by molecular dynamics simulation combined with a Markov model. Our results showed that BRD4-ZL0590 led to α-helices formation of 100-105 compared with Free-BRD4; the combination of MS436 caused residues 30-40 and 95-105 to form α-helices, while the combination of allosteric inhibitors untangled the α-helices formed by the MS436. The results of Markov flux analysis showed that the binding process of inhibitors mainly involved changes in the degree of α-helices at ZA loop. The binding of ZL0590 reduced the distance between ZA loop and BC loop, blocked the conformation at the active site, and inhibited the binding of MS436. After the allosteric inhibitor binding, the MS436 that could normally penetrate into the interior of the pocket was floating on the edge of the active pocket and did not continue to penetrate into the active pocket as expected. In summary, we provide a theoretical basis for the inhibition mechanism of ZL0590 against BRD4, which can be used as a reference for improving the development of drug targets for cancer therapy."

However, each cell expresses only a minor fraction of its potential and, in particular, the genes encoding the proteins necessary for basal metabolism and the proteins responsible for its specific phenotype. The ability to use only the right and necessary genes involved in specific functions depends on the structural organization of the nuclear chromatin, which in turn depends on the epigenetic history of each cell, which is stored in the form of a collection of DNA and protein modifications. Among these modifications, DNA methylation and many kinds of post-translational modifications of histones play a key role in organizing the complex indexing of usable genes. In addition, non-canonical histone proteins (also known as histone variants), the synthesis of which is not directly linked with DNA replication, are used to mark specific regions of the genome. Here, we will discuss the role of the H3.3 histone variant, with particular attention to its loading into chromatin in the mammalian nervous system, both in physiological and pathological conditions. Indeed, chromatin modifications that mark cell memory seem to be of special importance for the cells involved in the complex processes of learning and memory."

"37426026","Prenatal lead exposure is negatively associated with the gut microbiome in childhood.","Front Microbiol","Metal exposures are associated with gut microbiome (GM) composition and function, and exposures early in development may be particularly important. Considering the role of the GM in association with many adverse health outcomes, understanding the relationship between prenatal metal exposures and the GM is critically important. However, there is sparse knowledge of the association between prenatal metal exposure and GM later in childhood.This analysis aims to identify associations between prenatal lead (Pb) exposure and GM composition and function in children 9-11 years old.Data come from the Programming Research in Obesity, Growth, Environment and Social Stressors (PROGRESS) cohort based in Mexico City, Mexico. Prenatal metal concentrations were measured in maternal whole blood drawn during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Stool samples collected at 9-11 years old underwent metagenomic sequencing to assess the GM. This analysis uses multiple statistical modeling approaches, including linear regression, permutational analysis of variance, weighted quantile sum regression (WQS), and individual taxa regressions, to estimate the association between maternal blood Pb during pregnancy and multiple aspects of the child GM at 9-11 years old, adjusting for relevant confounders.Of the 123 child participants in this pilot data analysis, 74 were male and 49 were female. Mean prenatal maternal blood Pb was 33.6 (SE = 2.1) ug/L and 34.9 (SE = 2.1) ug/L at second and third trimesters, respectively. Analysis suggests a consistent negative relationship between prenatal maternal blood Pb and the GM at age 9-11, including measures of alpha and beta diversity, microbiome mixture analysis, and individual taxa. The WQS analysis showed a negative association between prenatal Pb exposure and the gut microbiome, for both second and third trimester exposures (2Tβ = -0.17, 95%CI = [-0.46,0.11]; 3Tβ = -0.17, 95%CI = [-0.44,0.10]).Ruminococcus gnavus,Bifidobacterium longum,Alistipes indistinctus,Bacteroides caccae, andBifidobacterium bifidumall had weights above the importance threshold from 80% or more of the WQS repeated holdouts in association with both second and third trimester Pb exposure.Pilot data analysis suggests a negative association between prenatal Pb exposure and the gut microbiome later in childhood; however, additional investigation is needed.Copyright © 2023 Eggers, Midya, Bixby, Gennings, Torres-Olascoaga, Walker, Wright, Arora and Téllez-Rojo."

A search in the MEDLINE-PubMed, Scopus, and EMBASE databases was done to identify related studies up to the end of February 2023. The meta-analysis was conducted according to recommendations of the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews.Fourteen studies involving 666 cases with ASD and ADHD and 585 controls were collected and judged relevant for the systematic review and meta-analysis. The pooled results by a random effects meta-analysis was reported as a geometric mean of the estimated average response ratio and 95% confidence interval. Overall analysis of studies reported differences in mtDNA-cn in blood samples (k = 10) and non-blood samples (brain tissues and oral samples;k = 4) suggested significantly higher mtDNA-cn in patients compared to controls (p = 0.0275). Sub-analysis by stratifying studies based on tissue type, showed no significant increase in mtDNA-cn in blood samples among patients and controls (p = 0.284). Conversely, higher mtDNA-cn was observed in non-blood samples in patients than in controls (p = 0.0122). Further stratified analysis based on blood-cell compositions as potential confounds showed no significant difference in mtDNA-cn in peripheral blood samples of patients comparted to controls (p = 0.074). In addition, stratified analysis of aged-matched ASD and ADHD patients and controls revealed no significant difference in mtDNA-cn in blood samples between patients and controls (p = 0.214), whereas a significant increase in mtDNA-cn was observed in non-blood samples between patients and controls (p < 0.001). Finally, when the mtDNA-cn was analyzed in blood samples of aged-matched patients with ASD (peripheral blood, leukocytes, and PBMCs) or ADHD (peripheral blood), no significant difference in mtDNA-cn was observed between ASD patients and controls (p = 0.385), while a significant increase in mtDNA-cn was found between ADHD patients and controls (p = 0.033).In this first meta-analysis of the evaluation of mtDNA-cn in ASD/ADHD, our results show elevated mtDNA-cn in ASD and ADHD, further emphasizing the implication of mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodevelopmental disorders. However, our results indicate that the mtDNA-cn in blood is not reflected in other tissues in ASD/ADHD, and the true relationship between blood-derived mtDNA-cn and ASD/ADHD remains to be defined in future studies. The importance of blood-cell compositions as confounders of blood-based mtDNA-cn measurement and the advantages of salivary mtDNA-cn should be considered in future studies. Moreover, the potential of mtDNA-cn as a biomarker for mitochondrial malfunction in neurodevelopmental disorders deserves further investigations.Copyright © 2023 Al-Kafaji, Jahrami, Alwehaidah, Alshammari and Husni."
"37443170","Sex differences in placenta-derived markers and later autistic traits in children.","Transl Psychiatry","Autism is more prevalent in males and males on average score higher on measures of autistic traits. Placental function is affected significantly by the sex of the fetus. It is unclear if sex differences in placental function are associated with sex differences in the occurrence of autistic traits postnatally. To assess this, concentrations of angiogenesis-related markers, placental growth factor (PlGF) and soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase (sFlt-1) were assessed in maternal plasma of expectant women in the late 1st(mean= 13.5 [SD = 2.0] weeks gestation) and 2ndtrimesters (mean=20.6 [SD = 1.2] weeks gestation), as part of the Generation R Study, Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Subsequent assessment of autistic traits in the offspring at age 6 was performed with the 18-item version of the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS). Associations of placental protein concentrations with autistic traits were tested in sex-stratified and cohort-wide regression models. Cases with pregnancy complications or a later autism diagnosis (n = 64) were also assessed for differences in placenta-derived markers. sFlt-1 levels were significantly lower in males in both trimesters but showed no association with autistic traits. PlGF was significantly lower in male pregnancies in the 1sttrimester, and significantly higher in the 2ndtrimester, compared to female pregnancies. Higher PlGF levels in the 2ndtrimester and the rate of PlGF increase were both associated with the occurrence of higher autistic traits (PlGF-2nd: n = 3469,b = 0.24 [SE = 0.11], p = 0.03) in both unadjusted and adjusted linear regression models that controlled for age, sex, placental weight and maternal characteristics. Mediation analyses showed that higher autistic traits in males compared to females were partly explained by higher PlGF or a faster rate of PlGF increase in the second trimester (PlGF-2nd: n = 3469, ACME: b = 0.005, [SE = 0.002], p = 0.004). In conclusion, higher PlGF levels in the 2ndtrimester and a higher rate of PlGF increase are associated with both being male, and with a higher number of autistic traits in the general population.© 2023.

"37438528","Spatially resolved multiomics of human cardiac niches.","Nature","The function of a cell is defined by its intrinsic characteristics and its niche: the tissue microenvironment in which it dwells. Here we combine single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data to discover cellular niches within eight regions of the human heart. We map cells to microanatomical locations and integrate knowledge-based and unsupervised structural annotations. We also profile the cells of the human cardiac conduction system1. The results revealed their distinctive repertoire of ion channels, G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and regulatory networks, and implicated FOXP2 in the pacemaker phenotype. We show that the sinoatrial node is compartmentalized, with a core of pacemaker cells, fibroblasts and glial cells supporting glutamatergic signalling. Using a custom CellPhoneDB.org module, we identify trans-synaptic pacemaker cell interactions with glia. We introduce a druggable target prediction tool, drug2cell, which leverages single-cell profiles and drug-target interactions to provide mechanistic insights into the chronotropic effects of drugs, including GLP-1 analogues. In the epicardium, we show enrichment of both IgG+and IgA+plasma cells forming immune niches that may contribute to infection defence. Overall, we provide new clarity to cardiac electro-anatomy and immunology, and our suite of computational approaches can be applied to other tissues and organs.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Although CHIP mutations drive myeloid malignancies like myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) it is unknown if clonal expansion is attributable to changes in cell type kinetics, or involves reorganization of the hematopoietic hierarchy. Using computational modeling we analyzed differentiation and proliferation kinetics of cultured hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) from 8 healthy individuals, 7 CHIP, and 10 MDS patients. While the standard hematopoietic hierarchy explained HSPC kinetics in healthy samples, 57% of CHIP and 70% of MDS samples were best described with alternative hierarchies. Deregulated kinetics were found at various HSPC compartments with high inter-individual heterogeneity in CHIP and MDS, while altered HSC rates were most relevant in MDS. Quantifying kinetic heterogeneity in detail, we show that reorganization of the HSPC compartment is already detectable in the premalignant CHIP state.© 2023 The Author(s)."
"37444441","Association of Myelofibrosis Phenotypes with Clinical Manifestations, Molecular Profiles, and Treatments.","Cancers (Basel)","Myelofibrosis (MF) presents an array of clinical manifestations and molecular profiles. The two distinct phenotypes- myeloproliferative and myelodepletive or cytopenic- are situated at the two poles of the disease spectrum and are largely defined by different degrees of cytopenias, splenomegaly, and distinct molecular profiles. The myeloproliferative phenotype is characterized by normal/higher peripheral blood counts or mildly decreased hemoglobin, progressive splenomegaly, and constitutional symptoms. The myeloproliferative phenotype is typically associated with secondary MF, higherJAK2V617F burden, fewer mutations, and superior overall survival (OS). The myelodepletive phenotype is usually associated with primary MF, ≥2 cytopenias, modest splenomegaly, lowerJAK2V617F burden, higher fibrosis, greater genomic complexity, and inferior OS. Cytopenias are associated with mutations in epigenetic regulators/splicing factors, clonal evolution, disease progression, and shorter OS. Clinical variables, in conjunction with the molecular profiles, inform integrated prognostication and disease management. Ruxolitinib/fedratinib and pacritinib/momelotinib may be more suitable to treat patients with the myeloproliferative and myelodepletive phenotypes, respectively. Appreciation of MF heterogeneity and two distinct phenotypes, the different clinical manifestations and molecular profiles associated with each phenotype alongside the growing treatment expertise, the development of non-myelosuppressive JAK inhibitors, and integrated prognostication are leading to a new era in patient management. Physicians can increasingly tailor personalized treatments that will address the unique unmet needs of MF patients, including those presenting with the myelodepletive phenotype, to elicit optimal outcomes and extended OS across the disease spectrum."
"37483591","Eosinophils as potential biomarkers in respiratory viral infections.","Front Immunol","Eosinophils are bone marrow-derived granulocytes that, under homeostatic conditions, account for as much as 1-3% of peripheral blood leukocytes. During inflammation, eosinophils can rapidly expand and infiltrate inflamed tissues, guided by cytokines and alarmins (such as IL-33), adhesion molecules and chemokines. Eosinophils play a prominent role in allergic asthma and parasitic infections. Nonetheless, they participate in the immune response against respiratory viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus and influenza. Notably, respiratory viruses are associated with asthma exacerbation. Eosinophils release several molecules endowed with antiviral activity, including cationic proteins, RNases and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. On the other hand, eosinophils release several cytokines involved in homeostasis maintenance and Th2-related inflammation. In the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, emerging evidence indicates that eosinophils can represent possible blood-based biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and severity prediction of disease. In particular, eosinopenia seems to be an indicator of severity among patients with COVID-19, whereas an increased eosinophil count is associated with a better prognosis, including a lower incidence of complications and mortality. In the present review, we provide an overview of the role and plasticity of eosinophils focusing on various respiratory viral infections and in the context of viral and allergic disease comorbidities. We will discuss the potential utility of eosinophils as prognostic/predictive immune biomarkers in emerging respiratory viral diseases, particularly COVID-19. Finally, we will revisit some of the relevant methods and tools that have contributed to the advances in the dissection of various eosinophil subsets in different pathological settings for future biomarker definition.Copyright © 2023 Macchia, La Sorsa, Urbani, Moretti, Antonucci, Afferni and Schiavoni."
"37430354","Exploring breast tissue microbial composition and the association with breast cancer risk factors.","Breast Cancer Res","Microbial dysbiosis has emerged as an important element in the development and progression of various cancers, including breast cancer. However, the microbial composition of the breast from healthy individuals, even relative to risk of developing breast cancer, remains unclear. Here, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the microbiota of the normal breast tissue, which was analyzed in relation to the microbial composition of the tumor and adjacent normal tissue.The study cohorts included 403 cancer-free women (who donated normal breast tissue cores) and 76 breast cancer patients (who donated tumor and/or adjacent normal tissue samples). Microbiome profiling was obtained by sequencing the nine hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene (V1V2, V2V3, V3V4, V4V5, V5V7, and V7V9). Transcriptome analysis was also performed on 190 normal breast tissue samples. Breast cancer risk score was assessed using the Tyrer-Cuzick risk model.The V1V2 amplicon sequencing resulted more suitable for the analysis of the normal breast microbiome and identified Lactobacillaceae (Firmicutes phylum), Acetobacterraceae, and Xanthomonadaceae (both Proteobacteria phylum) as the most abundant families in the normal breast. However, Ralstonia (Proteobacteria phylum) was more abundant in both breast tumors and histologically normal tissues adjacent to malignant tumors. We also conducted a correlation analysis between the microbiome and known breast cancer risk factors. Abundances of the bacterial taxa Acetotobacter aceti, Lactobacillus vini, Lactobacillus paracasei, and Xanthonomas sp. were associated with age (p < 0.0001), racial background (p < 0.0001), and parity (p < 0.0001). Finally, transcriptome analysis of normal breast tissues showed an enrichment in metabolism- and immune-related genes in the tissues with abundant Acetotobacter aceti, Lactobacillus vini, Lactobacillus paracasei, and Xanthonomas sp., whereas the presence of Ralstonia in the normal tissue was linked to dysregulation of genes involved in the carbohydrate metabolic pathway.This study defines the microbial features of normal breast tissue, thus providing a basis to understand cancer-related dysbiosis. Moreover, the findings reveal that lifestyle factors can significantly affect the normal breast microbial composition.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37500993","Nutritional and metabolic factors in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.","Nat Rev Neurol","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a complex neurodegenerative disease that is classically thought to impact the motor system. Over the past 20 years, research has started to consider the contribution of non-motor symptoms and features of the disease, and how they might affect ALS prognosis. Of the non-motor features of the disease, nutritional status (for example, malnutrition) and metabolic balance (for example, weight loss and hypermetabolism) have been consistently shown to contribute to more rapid disease progression and/or earlier death. Several complex cellular changes observed in ALS, including mitochondrial dysfunction, are also starting to be shown to contribute to bioenergetic failure. The resulting energy depletion in high energy demanding neurons makes them sensitive to apoptosis. Given that nutritional and metabolic stressors at the whole-body and cellular level can impact the capacity to maintain optimal function, these factors present avenues through which we can identify novel targets for treatment in ALS. Several clinical trials are now underway evaluating the effectiveness of modifying energy balance in ALS, making this article timely in reviewing the evidence base for metabolic and nutritional interventions.© 2023.

Disturbances in energy homeostasis were repeatedly associated with the ALS pathogenesis and appear early during the disease process. In this review, we highlight recent work demonstrating the crucial role of energy metabolism in ALS and discuss its potential clinical relevance.The alteration of various metabolic pathways contributes to the heterogeneity of the clinical phenotype of ALS. Recent work showed that different ALS mutations selectively impact these pathways and translate to the disease phenotypes in patients and disease models. Strikingly, a growing number of studies point towards an early, even presymptomatic, contribution of abnormal energy homeostasis to the ALS pathogenesis. Advances in metabolomics generated valuable tools to study altered metabolic pathways, to test their therapeutic potential, and to develop personalized medicine. Importantly, recent preclinical studies and clinical trials demonstrated that targeting energy metabolism is a promising therapeutic approach.Abnormal energy metabolism is a key player in ALS pathogenesis, emerging as a source of potential disease biomarkers and therapeutic targets.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

Whilst the oral lesions that reoccur in BD underpin the complex diagnostic process, the crucial role of dental professionals is highlighted in a case report summarised herein. We present a case of a 47-year-old male referred to the Oral Medicine Department by a rheumatologist after previous hospitalization for thrombosis of the iliac vein and inferior vena cava. He had elevated inflammatory C-reactive protein biomarker and an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Recurrent episodes of folliculitis, oral and genital ulcers were reported. Clinical examination revealed multiple ulcerations in the oral mucosa. The complementary, histopathological analysis performed to rule out other disorders, based on excisional biopsy, showed non-keratinised stratified squamous epithelium with areas of exocytosis and ulceration. The connective tissue presented an intense mixed inflammatory infiltrate, congested blood vessels, haemorrhage, vasculitis, and HLA-B genotyping identified the expression of HLA-B15, further supporting the BD diagnosis. Treatment was initiated with colchicine, prednisolone, and weekly subcutaneous administration of methotrexate and resulted in the complete remission of oral lesions and no recurrence of other manifestations.This BD case report emphasizes the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in diagnosing BD, including the use of histopathological assessment and genetic profiling. It highlights the significance of thorough intraoral assessment and referral to a multidisciplinary team for diagnosis. The oral manifestations of BD as the primary symptoms often indicate underlying major systemic pathologies. The authors stress the need for a structured diagnostic algorithm to facilitate timely and effective management of BD."

These often involve brain structures involved in the regulation of appetite, food intake, satiety, and reward processing. We examined the individual and interactive effects of PTSD diagnosis and MetS on cortical thickness and subcortical gray matter volumes in patients with PTSD (n = 104) compared to trauma-exposed controls (n = 97).Multivariate models were constructed for FreeSurfer-generated prefrontal cortical thickness and subcortical gray matter regions-of-interest (ROIs) to explore the effects of PTSD diagnosis and MetS as predictors, adjusting for relevant socio-demographic and clinical covariates. Individual prefrontal cortical and subcortical limbic ROIs were also selected based ona priorievidence of their involvement in both PTSD and MetS.The mean age of the sample (n = 201; 78% female) was 41.6 (SD, 13.1) years. PTSD and MetS status showed independent associations with prefrontal cortical thickness and subcortical gray matter volumes across multiple ROIs, adjusting for age, sex, scanner sequence, alcohol, and tobacco use.PTSD and MetS are independently associated with brain structural differences, including thinner prefrontal cortical thickness and smaller subcortical gray matter volumes, across multiple ROIs implicated in the hedonic and homeostatic regulation of food intake."
"37444419","MCAK Inhibitors Induce Aneuploidy in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Models.","Cancers (Basel)","Standard of care for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) involves the use of microtubule poisons such as paclitaxel, which are proposed to work by inducing lethal levels of aneuploidy in tumor cells. While these drugs are initially effective in treating cancer, dose-limiting peripheral neuropathies are common. Unfortunately, patients often relapse with drug-resistant tumors. Identifying agents against targets that limit aneuploidy may be a valuable approach for therapeutic development. One potential target is the microtubule depolymerizing kinesin, MCAK, which limits aneuploidy by regulating microtubule dynamics during mitosis. Using publicly available datasets, we found that MCAK is upregulated in triple-negative breast cancer and is associated with poorer prognoses. Knockdown of MCAK in tumor-derived cell lines caused a two- to five-fold reduction in the IC50for paclitaxel, without affecting normal cells. Using FRET and image-based assays, we screened compounds from the ChemBridge 50 k library and discovered three putative MCAK inhibitors. These compounds reproduced the aneuploidy-inducing phenotype of MCAK loss, reduced clonogenic survival of TNBC cells regardless of taxane-resistance, and the most potent of the three, C4, sensitized TNBC cells to paclitaxel. Collectively, our work shows promise that MCAK may serve as both a biomarker of prognosis and as a therapeutic target."

The heterogeneity ofin uteroopioid exposure, particularly exposure to polypharmacy, makes it difficult to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms that could inform early diagnosis and treatment of NOWS, and challenging to investigate consequences later in life.To address these issues, we developed a mouse model of NOWS that includes gestational and post-natal morphine exposure that encompasses the developmental equivalent of all three human trimesters and assessed both behavior and transcriptome alterations.Opioid exposure throughout all three human equivalent trimesters delayed developmental milestones and produced acute withdrawal phenotypes in mice reminiscent of those observed in infants. We also uncovered different patterns of gene expression depending on the duration and timing of opioid exposure (3-trimesters,in uteroonly, or the last trimester equivalent only). Opioid exposure and subsequent withdrawal affected social behavior and sleep in adulthood in a sex-dependent manner but did not affect adult behaviors related to anxiety, depression, or opioid response.Despite marked withdrawal and delays in development, long-term deficits in behaviors typically associated with substance use disorders were modest. Remarkably, transcriptomic analysis revealed an enrichment for genes with altered expression in published datasets for Autism Spectrum Disorders, which correlate well with the deficits in social affiliation seen in our model. The number of differentially expressed genes between the NOWS and saline groups varied markedly based on exposure protocol and sex, but common pathways included synapse development, the GABAergic and myelin systems, and mitochondrial function.Copyright © 2023 Dunn, Robinson, Nwokafor, Estill, Ferrante, Shen, Lemchi, Creus-Muncunill, Ramirez, Mengaziol, Brynildsen, Leggas, Horn, Ehrlich and Blendy."
"37447314","Association of Plasma Vitamins and Carotenoids, DNA Methylation of LCAT, and Risk of Age-Related Macular Degeneration.","Nutrients","Dysregulation of lipid metabolism has been implicated in age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of blindness among the elderly. Lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) is an important enzyme responsible for lipid metabolism, which could be regulated by DNA methylation during the development of various age-related diseases. This study aimed to assess the association between LCAT DNA methylation and the risk of AMD, and to examine whether plasma vitamin and carotenoid concentrations modified this association. A total of 126 cases of AMD and 174 controls were included in the present analysis. LCAT DNA methylation was detected by quantitative real-time methylation-1specific PCR (qMSP). Circulating vitamins and carotenoids were measured using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). DNA methylation of LCAT was significantly higher in patients with AMD than those in the control subjects. After multivariable adjustment, participants in the highest tertile of LCAT DNA methylation had a 5.37-fold higher risk (95% CI: 2.56, 11.28) of AMD compared with those in the lowest tertile. Each standard deviation (SD) increment of LCAT DNA methylation was associated with a 2.23-fold (95% CI: 1.58, 3.13) increased risk of AMD. There was a J-shaped association between LCAT DNA methylation and AMD risk (Pnon-linearity= 0.03). Higher concentrations of plasma retinol and β-cryptoxanthin were significantly associated with decreased levels of LCAT DNA methylation, with the multivariate-adjusted β coefficient being -0.05 (95% CI: -0.08, -0.01) and -0.25 (95% CI: -0.42, -0.08), respectively. In joint analyses of LCAT DNA methylation and plasma vitamin and carotenoid concentrations, the inverse association between increased LCAT DNA methylation and AMD risk was more pronounced among participants who had a lower concentration of plasma retinol and β-cryptoxanthin. These findings highlight the importance of comprehensively assessing LCAT DNA methylation and increasing vitamin and carotenoid status for the prevention of AMD."
"37426441","The toxic metal hypothesis for neurological disorders.","Front Neurol","Multiple sclerosis and the major sporadic neurogenerative disorders, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson disease, and Alzheimer disease are considered to have both genetic and environmental components. Advances have been made in finding genetic predispositions to these disorders, but it has been difficult to pin down environmental agents that trigger them. Environmental toxic metals have been implicated in neurological disorders, since human exposure to toxic metals is common from anthropogenic and natural sources, and toxic metals have damaging properties that are suspected to underlie many of these disorders. Questions remain, however, as to how toxic metals enter the nervous system, if one or combinations of metals are sufficient to precipitate disease, and how toxic metal exposure results in different patterns of neuronal and white matter loss. The hypothesis presented here is that damage to selective locus ceruleus neurons from toxic metals causes dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier. This allows circulating toxicants to enter astrocytes, from where they are transferred to, and damage, oligodendrocytes, and neurons. The type of neurological disorder that arises depends on (i) which locus ceruleus neurons are damaged, (ii) genetic variants that give rise to susceptibility to toxic metal uptake, cytotoxicity, or clearance, (iii) the age, frequency, and duration of toxicant exposure, and (iv) the uptake of various mixtures of toxic metals. Evidence supporting this hypothesis is presented, concentrating on studies that have examined the distribution of toxic metals in the human nervous system. Clinicopathological features shared between neurological disorders are listed that can be linked to toxic metals. Details are provided on how the hypothesis applies to multiple sclerosis and the major neurodegenerative disorders. Further avenues to explore the toxic metal hypothesis for neurological disorders are suggested. In conclusion, environmental toxic metals may play a part in several common neurological disorders. While further evidence to support this hypothesis is needed, to protect the nervous system it would be prudent to take steps to reduce environmental toxic metal pollution from industrial, mining, and manufacturing sources, and from the burning of fossil fuels.Copyright © 2023 Pamphlett and Bishop."

Bioinformatics and high-throughput biological data coming from different sources can even be more helpful, because each of these different data chunks can provide alternative, complementary information about a specific biological phenomenon, similar to multiple photos of the same subject taken from different angles. In this context, the integration of bioinformatics and high-throughput biological data gets a pivotal role in running a successful bioinformatics study. In the last decades, data originating from proteomics, metabolomics, metagenomics, phenomics, transcriptomics, and epigenomics have been labelled -omics data, as a unique name to refer to them, and the integration of these omics data has gained importance in all biological areas. Even if this omics data integration is useful and relevant, due to its heterogeneity, it is not uncommon to make mistakes during the integration phases. We therefore decided to present these ten quick tips to perform an omics data integration correctly, avoiding common mistakes we experienced or noticed in published studies in the past.

"37399421","Intrinsic neural diversity quenches the dynamic volatility of neural networks.","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","Heterogeneity is the norm in biology. The brain is no different: Neuronal cell types are myriad, reflected through their cellular morphology, type, excitability, connectivity motifs, and ion channel distributions. While this biophysical diversity enriches neural systems' dynamical repertoire, it remains challenging to reconcile with the robustness and persistence of brain function over time (resilience). To better understand the relationship between excitability heterogeneity (variability in excitability within a population of neurons) and resilience, we analyzed both analytically and numerically a nonlinear sparse neural network with balanced excitatory and inhibitory connections evolving over long time scales. Homogeneous networks demonstrated increases in excitability, and strong firing rate correlations-signs of instability-in response to a slowly varying modulatory fluctuation. Excitability heterogeneity tuned network stability in a context-dependent way by restraining responses to modulatory challenges and limiting firing rate correlations, while enriching dynamics during states of low modulatory drive. Excitability heterogeneity was found to implement a homeostatic control mechanism enhancing network resilience to changes in population size, connection probability, strength and variability of synaptic weights, by quenching the volatility (i.e., its susceptibility to critical transitions) of its dynamics. Together, these results highlight the fundamental role played by cell-to-cell heterogeneity in the robustness of brain function in the face of change."
"37441552","The genetic basis of onset age in schizophrenia: evidence and models.","Front Genet","Schizophrenia is a heritable neurocognitive disorder affecting about 1% of the population, and usually has an onset age at around 21-25 in males and 25-30 in females. Recent advances in genetics have helped to identify many common and rare variants for the liability to schizophrenia. Earlier evidence appeared to suggest that younger onset age is associated with higher genetic liability to schizophrenia. Clinical longitudinal research also found that early and very-early onset schizophrenia are associated with poor clinical, neurocognitive, and functional profiles. A recent study reported a heritability of 0.33 for schizophrenia onset age, but the genetic basis of this trait in schizophrenia remains elusive. In the pre-Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) era, genetic loci found to be associated with onset age were seldom replicated. In the post-Genome-Wide Association Study era, new conceptual frameworks are needed to clarify the role of onset age in genetic research in schizophrenia, and to identify its genetic basis. In this review, we first discussed the potential of onset age as a characterizing/subtyping feature for psychosis, and as an important phenotypic dimension of schizophrenia. Second, we reviewed the methods, samples, findings and limitations of previous genetic research on onset age in schizophrenia. Third, we discussed a potential conceptual framework for studying the genetic basis of onset age, as well as the concepts of susceptibility, modifier, and ""mixed"" genes. Fourth, we discussed the limitations of this review. Lastly, we discussed the potential clinical implications for genetic research of onset age of schizophrenia, and how future research can unveil the potential mechanisms for this trait.Copyright © 2023 Zhan, Sham, So and Lui."
"37508346","Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Neuro-Immunometabolic Hypothesis of the Developmental Origins.","Biology (Basel)","Fetal neuroinflammation and prenatal stress (PS) may contribute to lifelong neurological disabilities. Astrocytes and microglia, among the brain's non-neuronal ""glia"" cell populations, play a pivotal role in neurodevelopment and predisposition to and initiation of disease throughout lifespan. One of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders manifesting between 1-4 years of age is the autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A pathological glial-neuronal interplay is thought to increase the risk for clinical manifestation of ASD in at-risk children, but the mechanisms remain poorly understood, and integrative, multi-scale models are needed. We propose a model that integrates the data across the scales of physiological organization, from genome to phenotype, and provides a foundation to explain the disparate findings on the genomic level. We hypothesize that via gene-environment interactions, fetal neuroinflammation and PS may reprogram glial immunometabolic phenotypes that impact neurodevelopment and neurobehavior. Drawing on genomic data from the recently published series of ovine and rodent glial transcriptome analyses with fetuses exposed to neuroinflammation or PS, we conducted an analysis on the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI) Gene database. We confirmed 21 gene hits. Using unsupervised statistical network analysis, we then identified six clusters of probable protein-protein interactions mapping onto the immunometabolic and stress response networks and epigenetic memory. These findings support our hypothesis. We discuss the implications for ASD etiology, early detection, and novel therapeutic approaches. We conclude with delineation of the next steps to verify our model on the individual gene level in an assumption-free manner. The proposed model is of interest for the multidisciplinary community of stakeholders engaged in ASD research, the development of novel pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments, early prevention, and detection as well as for policy makers."
"37508536","Epigenetic Reprogramming in Mice and Humans: From Fertilization to Primordial Germ Cell Development.","Cells","In this review, advances in the understanding of epigenetic reprogramming from fertilization to the development of primordial germline cells in a mouse andhumanembryo are discussed. To gain insights into the molecular underpinnings of various diseases, it is essential to comprehend the intricate interplay between genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors during cellular reprogramming and embryonic differentiation. An increasing range of diseases, including cancer and developmental disorders, have been linked to alterations in DNA methylation and histone modifications. Global epigenetic reprogramming occurs in mammals at two stages: post-fertilization and during the development of primordial germ cells (PGC). Epigenetic reprogramming after fertilization involves rapid demethylation of the paternal genome mediated through active and passive DNA demethylation, and gradual demethylation in the maternal genome through passive DNA demethylation. The de novo DNA methyltransferase enzymes,Dnmt3aandDnmt3b, restore DNA methylation beginning from the blastocyst stage until the formation of the gastrula, and DNA maintenance methyltransferase,Dnmt1, maintains methylation in the somatic cells. The PGC undergo a second round of global demethylation after allocation during the formative pluripotent stage before gastrulation, where the imprints and the methylation marks on the transposable elements known as retrotransposons, including long interspersed nuclear elements (LINE-1) and intracisternal A-particle (IAP) elements are demethylated as well. Finally, DNA methylation is restored in the PGC at the implantation stage including sex-specific imprints corresponding to the sex of the embryo. This review introduces a novel perspective by uncovering how toxicants and stress stimuli impact the critical period of allocation during formative pluripotency, potentially influencing both the quantity and quality of PGCs. Furthermore, the comprehensive comparison of epigenetic events betweenmiceandhumansbreaks new ground, empowering researchers to make informed decisions regarding the suitability of mouse models for their experiments."
"37432206","The Risk of Breast Cancer between Western and Mediterranean Dietary Patterns.","Nutrients","Breast cancer is a significant public health problem globally and prevention strategies have become of great interest as its incidence rises. Exploring the connection between dietary patterns and the reduction of breast cancer risk is considered a promising approach. High levels of fiber, phytochemicals, a good antioxidant profile, and a composition of advantageous fatty acids are characteristics of healthy dietary programs such as the Mediterranean diet. This review summarized and discussed the active compounds that are considered important in preventing breast cancer, including dietary components from recent related reports. These include polyunsaturated fatty acids, fiber, phytochemicals, and alcohol. Although the exact mechanism for preventing breast cancer using these dietary factors is not well understood, the combination of all the elements in a healthy diet plays a role in reducing breast cancer risk. Considering the elevated probability of breast cancer relapse and mortality, it is crucial to investigate the correlation between a nutritious dietary pattern and breast cancer, while identifying bioactive components that have the potential to mitigate the risk of breast cancer incidence."

We examined associations between pregnancy and childhood PFOS and PFOA exposure and childhood infections, asthma, allergic sensitization, atopic dermatitis, and lung function measures, and studied potential mechanisms by integrating data on systemic low-grade inflammation (hs-CRP), functional immune responses, and epigenetics.Higher maternal PFOS and PFOA exposure during pregnancy showed association with a non-atopic asthma phenotype by age 6, a protection against sensitization, and no association with atopic asthma or lung function, or atopic dermatitis. The effect was primarily driven by prenatal exposure. There was no association with infection proneness, low-grade inflammation, altered immune responses or epigenetic changes.Prenatal exposure to PFOS and PFOA, but not childhood exposure, specifically increased the risk of low prevalent non-atopic asthma, whereas there was no effect on atopic asthma, lung function, or atopic dermatitis.All funding received by COPSAC are listed on www.copsac.com.

"37471612","Recent Advances in Blood-Based Liquid Biopsy Approaches in Prostate Cancer.","Cancer J","The advent of high-throughput technologies has enabled the analysis of minute amounts of tumor-derived material purified from body fluids, termed ""liquid biopsies."" Prostate cancer (PCa) management, like in many other cancer types, has benefited from liquid biopsies at several stages of the disease. Although initially describing circulating tumor cells in blood, the term ""liquid biopsy"" has come to more prominently include cell-free, circulating tumor DNA, as well as RNA, proteins, and other molecules. They provide tumor molecular information representing the entire, often-heterogeneous disease, relatively noninvasively and longitudinally. Blood has been the main liquid biopsy specimen in PCa, and urine has also proven beneficial. Technological advances have allowed clinical implementation of some liquid biopsies in PCa, in disease monitoring and precision oncology. This narrative review introduces the main types of blood-based PCa liquid biopsies focusing on advances in the past 5 years. Clinical adoption of liquid biopsies to detect and monitor the evolving PCa tumor biology promises to deepen our understanding of the disease and improve patient outcomes.Copyright © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"37528266","Contribution of constitutional BRCA1 promoter methylation to early-onset and familial breast cancer patients from Pakistan.","Breast Cancer Res Treat","Constitutional BRCA1 promoter methylation has been identified as a potential risk factor for breast cancer (BC) in the Caucasian population. However, this data is lacking for BC patients of Asian origin. Therefore, we assessed the contribution of constitutional BRCA1 promoter methylation in Pakistani BC patients.A total of 385 BRCA1/2-negative index BC patients (197 early-onset BC (≤ 30 years), 152 familial BC, 17 familial BC and ovarian cancer, 19 male BC) and 107 healthy controls were screened for the constitutional BRCA1 promoter methylation by methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting assay. Overall, 131 patients displayed triple-negative BC (TNBC) and 254 non-TNBC phenotypes. The prevalence of BRCA1 promoter methylation was calculated based on clinicopathological characteristics using univariable and multivariable logistic regression models.Constitutional BRCA1 promoter methylation was identified in 19.5% (75/385) of BC patients and 13.1% (14/107) of controls. The frequency of methylation was higher in early-onset BC (23.4% vs. 13.1%, P = 0.035) and TNBC patients (29.0% vs. 13.1%, P = 0.004) compared to controls. Methylation was also more prevalent in patients with high-grade than low-grade tumors (21.7% vs. 12.2%, P = 0.034) and progesterone receptor (PR)-negative than PR-positive tumors (26.0% vs. 13.9%, P = 0.004). Constitutional BRCA1 promoter methylation remained independently associated with TNBC phenotype (odds ratio 1.99; 95% CI 1.12-3.54; P = 0.02) after adjusting for BC diagnosis age, tumor grade, ER, and PR status.Constitutional BRCA1 promoter methylation is associated with TNBC and can serve as a non-invasive blood-based biomarker for Pakistani TNBC patients.© 2023.

"37491348","Discovery of putative long non-coding RNAs expressed in the eyes of Astyanax mexicanus (Actinopterygii: Characidae).","Sci Rep","Astyanax mexicanus is a well-known model species, that has two morphotypes, cavefish, from subterranean rivers and surface fish, from surface rivers. They are morphologically distinct due to many troglomorphic traits in the cavefish, such as the absence of eyes. Most studies on A. mexicanus are focused on eye development and protein-coding genes involved in the process. However, lncRNAs did not get the same attention and very little is known about them. This study aimed to fill this knowledge gap, identifying, describing, classifying, and annotating lncRNAs expressed in the embryo's eye tissue of cavefish and surface fish. To do so, we constructed a concise workflow to assemble and evaluate transcriptomes, annotate protein-coding genes, ncRNAs families, predict the coding potential, identify putative lncRNAs, map them and predict interactions. This approach resulted in the identification of 33,069 and 19,493 putative lncRNAs respectively mapped in cavefish and surface fish. Thousands of these lncRNAs were annotated and identified as conserved in human and several species of fish. Hundreds of them were validated in silico, through ESTs. We identified lncRNAs associated with genes related to eye development. This is the case of a few lncRNAs associated with sox2, which we suggest being isomorphs of the SOX2-OT, a lncRNA that can regulate the expression of sox2. This work is one of the first studies to focus on the description of lncRNAs in A. mexicanus, highlighting several lncRNA targets and opening an important precedent for future studies focusing on lncRNAs expressed in A. mexicanus.© 2023.

"37489459","DoxoDB: A Database for the Expression Analysis of Doxorubicin-Induced lncRNA Genes.","Noncoding RNA","Cancer and cardiovascular disease are the leading causes of death worldwide. Recent evidence suggests that these two life-threatening diseases share several features in disease progression, such as angiogenesis, fibrosis, and immune responses. This has led to the emergence of a new field called cardio-oncology. Doxorubicin is a chemotherapy drug widely used to treat cancer, such as bladder and breast cancer. However, this drug causes serious side effects, including acute ventricular dysfunction, cardiomyopathy, and heart failure. Based on this evidence, we hypothesize that comparing the expression profiles of cells and tissues treated with doxorubicin may yield new insights into the adverse effects of the drug on cellular activities. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed published RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from doxorubicin-treated cells to identify commonly differentially expressed genes, including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) as they are known to be dysregulated in diseased tissues and cells. From our systematic analysis, we identified several doxorubicin-induced genes. To confirm these findings, we treated human cardiac fibroblasts with doxorubicin to record expression changes in the selected doxorubicin-induced genes and performed a loss-of-function experiment of the lncRNAMAP3K4-AS1. To further disseminate the analyzed data, we built the web database DoxoDB."
"37460814","Integrated analysis of copy number variation-associated lncRNAs identifies candidates contributing to the etiologies of congenital kidney anomalies.","Commun Biol","Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) are disorders resulting from defects in the development of the kidneys and their outflow tract. Copy number variations (CNVs) have been identified as important genetic variations leading to CAKUT, whereas most CAKUT-associated CNVs cannot be attributed to a specific pathogenic gene. Here we construct coexpression networks involving long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) within these CNVs (CNV-lncRNAs) using human kidney developmental transcriptomic data. The results show that CNV-lncRNAs encompassed in recurrent CAKUT associated CNVs have highly correlated expression with CAKUT genes in the developing kidneys. The regulatory effects of two hub CNV-lncRNAs (HSALNG0134318 in 22q11.2 and HSALNG0115943 in 17q12) in the module most significantly enriched in known CAKUT genes (CAKUT_sig1, P = 1.150 × 10-6) are validated experimentally. Our results indicate that the reduction of CNV-lncRNAs can downregulate CAKUT genes as predicted by our computational analyses. Furthermore, knockdown of HSALNG0134318 would downregulate HSALNG0115943 and affect kidney development related pathways. The results also indicate that the CAKUT_sig1 module has function significance involving multi-organ development. Overall, our findings suggest that CNV-lncRNAs play roles in regulating CAKUT genes, and the etiologies of CAKUT-associated CNVs should take account of effects on the noncoding genome.© 2023.

"37456663","Long non-coding RNAs in non-small cell lung cancer: implications for EGFR-TKI resistance.","Front Genet","Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the most common types of malignant tumors as well as the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the world. The application of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has dramatically improved the prognosis of NSCLC patients who harbor EGFR mutations. However, despite an excellent initial response, NSCLC inevitably becomes resistant to EGFR-TKIs, leading to irreversible disease progression. Hence, it is of great significance to shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the EGFR-TKI resistance in NSCLC. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are critical gene modulators that are able to act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors that modulate tumorigenesis, invasion, and metastasis. Recently, extensive evidence demonstrates that lncRNAs also have a significant function in modulating EGFR-TKI resistance in NSCLC. In this review, we present a comprehensive summary of the lncRNAs involved in EGFR-TKI resistance in NSCLC and focus on their detailed mechanisms of action, including activation of alternative bypass signaling pathways, phenotypic transformation, intercellular communication in the tumor microenvironment, competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) networks, and epigenetic modifications. In addition, we briefly discuss the limitations and the clinical implications of current lncRNAs research in this field.Copyright © 2023 Liu, Lu, Huang and Zhuang."

"37468977","The application of Aptamer in biomarker discovery.","Biomark Res","Biomarkers are detectable molecules that can reflect specific physiological states of cells, organs, and organisms and therefore be regarded as indicators for specific diseases. And the discovery of biomarkers plays an essential role in cancer management from the initial diagnosis to the final treatment regime. Practically, reliable clinical biomarkers are still limited, restricted by the suboptimal methods in biomarker discovery. Nucleic acid aptamers nowadays could be used as a powerful tool in the discovery of protein biomarkers. Nucleic acid aptamers are single-strand oligonucleotides that can specifically bind to various targets with high affinity. As artificial ssDNA or RNA, aptamers possess unique advantages compared to conventional antibodies. They can be flexible in design, low immunogenicity, relative chemical/thermos stability, as well as modifying convenience. Several SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment) based methods have been generated recently to construct aptamers for discovering new biomarkers in different cell locations. Secretome SELEX-based aptamers selection can facilitate the identification of secreted protein biomarkers. The aptamers developed by cell-SELEX can be used to unveil those biomarkers presented on the cell surface. The aptamers from tissue-SELEX could target intracellular biomarkers. And as a multiplexed protein biomarker detection technology, aptamer-based SOMAScan can analyze thousands of proteins in a single run. In this review, we will introduce the principle and workflow of variations of SELEX-based methods, including secretome SELEX, ADAPT, Cell-SELEX and tissue SELEX.

In this study, we utilized multivariable regularized regression techniques to identify a reduced set of proteins that could discriminate between AD and cognitively normal (CN) brain samples. Utilizing eNetXplorer, an R package that tests the accuracy and significance of a family of elastic net generalized linear models, we identified 4 proteins (SMOC1, NOG, APCS, NTN1) that accurately discriminated between AD (n = 31) and CN (n = 22) middle frontal gyrus (MFG) tissue samples from Religious Orders Study participants with 83 percent accuracy. We then validated this signature in MFG samples from Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging participants using leave-one-out logistic regression cross-validation, finding that the signature again accurately discriminated AD (n = 31) and CN (n = 19) participants with a receiver operating characteristic curve area under the curve of 0.863. These proteins were strongly correlated with the burden of neurofibrillary tangle and amyloid pathology in both study cohorts. We additionally tested whether these proteins differed between AD and CN inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) samples and blood serum samples at the time of AD diagnosis in ROS and BLSA, finding that the proteins differed between AD and CN ITG samples but not in blood serum samples. The identified proteins may provide mechanistic insights into the pathophysiology of AD, and the methods utilized in this study may serve as the basis for further work with additional high-dimensional datasets in AD.© 2023.

Herein, we develop a swab ""dip"" test in saliva obtained from consenting patients participating in a lung-cancer-screening programme being undertaken in North West England. In a pilot study, a total of 211 saliva samples (n= 170 benign, 41 designated cancer-positive) were randomly taken during the course of this prospective lung-cancer-screening programme. The samples (sterile Copan blue rayon swabs dipped in saliva) were analysed using attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy. An exploratory analysis using principal component analysis (PCA,) with or without linear discriminant analysis (LDA), was then undertaken. Three pairwise comparisons were undertaken including: (1) benign vs. cancer following swab analysis; (2) benign vs. cancer following swab analysis with the subtraction of dry swab spectra; and (3) benign vs. cancer following swab analysis with the subtraction of wet swab spectra. Consistent and remarkably similar patterns of clustering for the benign control vs. cancer categories, irrespective of whether the swab plus saliva sample was analysed or whether there was a subtraction of wet or dry swab spectra, was observed. In each case, MANOVA demonstrated that this segregation of categories is highly significant. A k-NN (using three nearest neighbours) machine-learning algorithm also showed that the specificity (90%) and sensitivity (75%) are consistent for each pairwise comparison. In detailed analyses, the swab as a substrate did not alter the level of spectral discrimination between benign control vs. cancer saliva samples. These results demonstrate a novel swab ""dip"" test using saliva as a biofluid that is highly applicable to be rolled out into a larger lung-cancer-screening programme."

Over the past decades, liquid biopsy has proven to be a powerful tool in clinical oncology, isolating tumor-derived entities from the blood. Liquid biopsy permits several advantages over tissue biopsy: it is non-invasive, and it should provide a better view of tumor heterogeneity, gene alterations, and clonal evolution. Consequentially, liquid biopsy has gained attention as a cancer biomarker tool, with growing clinical applications in NSCLC. In the era of precision medicine based on molecular typing, non-invasive genotyping methods became increasingly important due to the great number of oncogene drivers and the small tissue specimen often available. In our work, we comprehensively reviewed established and emerging applications of liquid biopsy in NSCLC. We made an excursus on laboratory analysis methods and the applications of liquid biopsy either in early or metastatic NSCLC disease settings. We deeply reviewed current data and future perspectives regarding screening, minimal residual disease, micrometastasis detection, and their implication in adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy management. Moreover, we reviewed liquid biopsy diagnostic utility in the absence of tissue biopsy and its role in monitoring treatment response and emerging resistance in metastatic NSCLC treated with target therapy and immuno-therapy."

"37489337","Cannabis- and Substance-Related Carcinogenesis in Europe: A Lagged Causal Inferential Panel Regression Study.","J Xenobiot","Recent European data facilitate an epidemiological investigation of the controversial cannabis-cancer relationship. Of particular concern were prior findings associating high-dose cannabis use with reproductive problems and potential genetic impacts. Cancer incidence data age-standardised to the world population was obtained from the European Cancer Information System 2000-2020 and many European national cancer registries. Drug use data were obtained from the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction. Alcohol and tobacco consumption was sourced from the WHO. Median household income was taken from the World bank. Cancer rates in high-cannabis-use countries were significantly higher than elsewhere (β-estimate = 0.4165,p= 3.54 × 10-115). Eighteen of forty-one cancers (42,675 individual rates) were significantly associated with cannabis exposure at bivariate analysis. Twenty-five cancers were linked in inverse-probability-weighted multivariate models. Temporal lagging in panel models intensified these effects. In multivariable models, cannabis was a more powerful correlate of cancer incidence than tobacco or alcohol. Reproductive toxicity was evidenced by the involvement of testis, ovary, prostate and breast cancers and because some of the myeloid and lymphoid leukaemias implicated occur in childhood, indicating inherited intergenerational genotoxicity. Cannabis is a more important carcinogen than tobacco and alcohol and fulfills epidemiological qualitative and quantitative criteria for causality for 25/41 cancers. Reproductive and transgenerational effects are prominent. These findings confirm the clinical and epidemiological salience of cannabis as a major multigenerational community carcinogen."

Spatial transcriptomics holds the potential to quantify such variation, but existing analysis methods are limited by their focus on individual tasks such as spot deconvolution. We present BayesTME, an end-to-end Bayesian method for analyzing spatial transcriptomics data. BayesTME unifies several previously distinct analysis goals under a single, holistic generative model. This unified approach enables BayesTME to deconvolve spots into cell phenotypes without any need for paired single-cell RNA-seq. BayesTME then goes beyond spot deconvolution to uncover spatial expression patterns among coordinated subsets of genes within phenotypes, which we term spatial transcriptional programs. BayesTME achieves state-of-the-art performance across myriad benchmarks. On human and zebrafish melanoma tissues, BayesTME identifies spatial transcriptional programs that capture fundamental biological phenomena such as bilateral symmetry and tumor-associated fibroblast and macrophage reprogramming.

We previously showed that residues in the insert-2 motif of human Rev1 (hRev1) increased the affinity of the enzyme for G4 DNA and mediated suppression of mutagenic replication near G4 motifs. We have now investigated the conservation of G4-selective properties in Rev1 from other species. We compared Rev1 fromDanio rerio(zRev1),Saccharomyces cerevisiae(yRev1), andLeishmania donovani(lRev1) with hRev1, including an insert-2 mutant form of hRev1 (E466A/Y470A or EY). We found that zRev1 retained all of the G4-selective prowess of the human enzyme, but there was a marked attenuation of G4 binding affinity for the EY hRev1 mutant and the two Rev1 proteins lacking insert-2 (yRev1 and lRev1). Perhaps most strikingly, we found that insert-2 was important for disruption of the G4 structure and optimal stimulation of processive DNA synthesis across the guanine-rich motif by DNA polymerase kappa (pol κ). Our findings have implications for how Rev1 might contribute to G4 replication in different species spanning the evolutionary tree - signaling the importance of selection for enzymes with robust G4-selective properties in organisms where these non-B DNA structures may fulfill taxa-specific physiological functions.This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry."
"37508574","Liquid Biopsy in Neurological Diseases.","Cells","The most recent and non-invasive approach for studying early-stage biomarkers is liquid biopsy. This implies the extraction and analysis of non-solid biological tissues (serum, plasma, saliva, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid) without undergoing invasive procedures to determine disease prognosis. Liquid biopsy can be used for the screening of several components, such as extracellular vesicles, microRNAs, cell-free DNA, cell-free mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, circulating tumour cells, circulating tumour DNA, transfer RNA, and circular DNA or RNA derived from body fluids. Its application includes early disease diagnosis, the surveillance of disease activity, and treatment response monitoring, with growing evidence for validating this methodology in cancer, liver disease, and central nervous system (CNS) disorders.

"37509213","Assessment of Colorectal Cancer Risk Factors through the Application of Network-Based Approaches in a Racially Diverse Cohort of Colon Organoid Stem Cells.","Cancers (Basel)","Numerous demographic factors have been associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. To better define biological mechanisms underlying these associations, we performed RNA sequencing of stem-cell-enriched organoids derived from the healthy colons of seven European Americans and eight African Americans. A weighted gene co-expression network analysis was performed following RNA sequencing. Module-trait relationships were determined through the association testing of each module and five CRC risk factors (age, body mass index, sex, smoking history, and race). Only modules that displayed a significantly positive correlation for gene significance and module membership were considered for further investigation. In total, 16 modules were associated with known CRC risk factors (p< 0.05). To contextualize the role of risk modules in CRC, publicly available RNA-sequencing data from TCGA-COAD were downloaded and re-analyzed. Differentially expressed genes identified between tumors and matched normal-adjacent tissue were overlaid across each module. Loci derived from CRC genome-wide association studies were additionally overlaid across modules to identify robust putative targets of risk. Among them,MYBL2andRXRArepresented strong plausible drivers through which cigarette smoking and BMI potentially modulated CRC risk, respectively. In summary, our findings highlight the potential of the colon organoid system in identifying novel CRC risk mechanisms in an ancestrally diverse and cellularly relevant population."
"37510095","Characterization of Mitochondrial DNA Methylation of Alzheimer's Disease in Plasma Cell-Free DNA.","Diagnostics (Basel)","Noninvasive diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is important for patients. Significant differences in the methylation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) were found in AD brain tissue. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is a noninvasive and economical diagnostic tool. We aimed to characterize mtDNA methylation alterations in the plasma cfDNA of 31 AD patients and 26 age- and sex-matched cognitively normal control subjects. We found that the mtDNA methylation patterns differed between AD patients and control subjects. The mtDNA was predominantly hypomethylated in the plasma cfDNA of AD patients. The hypomethylation sites or regions were mainly located in mt-rRNA, mt-tRNA, and D-Loop regions. The hypomethylation of the D-Loop region in plasma cfDNA of AD patients was consistent with that in previous studies. This study presents evidence that hypomethylation in the non-protein coding region of mtDNA may contribute to the pathogenesis of AD and potential application for the diagnosis of AD."
"37371506","APOE Peripheral and Brain Impact: APOE4 Carriers Accelerate Their Alzheimer Continuum and Have a High Risk of Suicide in PM(2.5) Polluted Cities.","Biomolecules","This Review emphasizes the impact of APOE4-the most significant genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD)-on peripheral and neural effects starting in childhood. We discuss major mechanistic players associated with the APOE alleles' effects in humans to understand their impact from conception through all life stages and the importance of detrimental, synergistic environmental exposures. APOE4 influences AD pathogenesis, and exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), manufactured nanoparticles (NPs), and ultrafine particles (UFPs) associated with combustion and friction processes appear to be major contributors to cerebrovascular dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress. In the context of outdoor and indoor PM pollution burden-as well as Fe, Ti, and Al alloys; Hg, Cu, Ca, Sn, and Si UFPs/NPs-in placenta and fetal brain tissues, urban APOE3 and APOE4 carriers are developing AD biological disease hallmarks (hyperphosphorylated-tau (P-tau) and amyloid beta 42 plaques (Aβ42)). Strikingly, for Metropolitan Mexico City (MMC) young residents ≤ 40 y, APOE4 carriers have 4.92 times higher suicide odds and 23.6 times higher odds of reaching Braak NFT V stage versus APOE4 non-carriers. The National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) framework could serve to test the hypothesis that UFPs and NPs are key players for oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, protein aggregation and misfolding, faulty complex protein quality control, and early damage to cell membranes and organelles of neural and vascular cells. Noninvasive biomarkers indicative of the P-tau and Aβ42abnormal protein deposits are needed across the disease continuum starting in childhood. Among the 21.8 million MMC residents, we have potentially 4 million APOE4 carriers at accelerated AD progression. These APOE4 individuals are prime candidates for early neuroprotective interventional trials. APOE4 is key in the development of AD evolving from childhood in highly polluted urban centers dominated by anthropogenic and industrial sources of pollution. APOE4 subjects are at higher early risk of AD development, and neuroprotection ought to be implemented. Effective reductions of PM2.5, UFP, and NP emissions from all sources are urgently needed. Alzheimer's Disease prevention ought to be at the core of the public health response and physicians-scientist minority research be supported."

Currently, no adequate method exists to unveil how these variations regulate gene expression in heterogeneous cancer cell populations at a single-cell resolution.Here, we developed a single-cell multi-omics sequencing method, scGTP-seq, to analyse ecDNA and SVs using long-read sequencing technologies.We demonstrated that our method can efficiently detect ecDNA and SVs and illustrated how these variations affect transcriptomic changes in various cell lines.

"37468915","Quantitative proteomics of cerebrospinal fluid from African Americans and Caucasians reveals shared and divergent changes in Alzheimer's disease.","Mol Neurodegener","Despite being twice as likely to get Alzheimer's disease (AD), African Americans have been grossly underrepresented in AD research. While emerging evidence indicates that African Americans with AD have lower cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of Tau compared to Caucasians, other differences in AD CSF biomarkers have not been fully elucidated. Here, we performed unbiased proteomic profiling of CSF from African Americans and Caucasians with and without AD to identify both common and divergent AD CSF biomarkers.Multiplex tandem mass tag-based mass spectrometry (TMT-MS) quantified 1,840 proteins from 105 control and 98 AD patients of which 100 identified as Caucasian while 103 identified as African American. We used differential protein expression and co-expression approaches to assess how changes in the CSF proteome are related to race and AD. Co-expression network analysis organized the CSF proteome into 14 modules associated with brain cell-types and biological pathways. A targeted mass spectrometry method, selected reaction monitoring (SRM), with heavy labeled internal standards was used to measure a panel of CSF module proteins across a subset of African Americans and Caucasians with or without AD. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis assessed the performance of each protein biomarker in differentiating controls and AD by race.Consistent with previous findings, the increase of Tau levels in AD was greater in Caucasians than in African Americans by both immunoassay and TMT-MS measurements. CSF modules which included 14-3-3 proteins (YWHAZ and YWHAG) demonstrated equivalent disease-related elevations in both African Americans and Caucasians with AD, whereas other modules demonstrated more profound disease changes within race. Modules enriched with proteins involved with glycolysis and neuronal/cytoskeletal proteins, including Tau, were more increased in Caucasians than in African Americans with AD. In contrast, a module enriched with synaptic proteins including VGF, SCG2, and NPTX2 was significantly lower in African Americans than Caucasians with AD. Following SRM and ROC analysis, VGF, SCG2, and NPTX2 were significantly better at classifying African Americans than Caucasians with AD.Our findings provide insight into additional protein biomarkers and pathways reflecting underlying brain pathology that are shared or differ by race.© 2023.

"37468682","Potential Ocular Biomarkers for Early Detection of Alzheimer's Disease and Their Roles in Artificial Intelligence Studies.","Neurol Ther","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia worldwide. Early detection is believed to be essential to disease management because it enables physicians to initiate treatment in patients with early-stage AD (early AD), with the possibility of stopping the disease or slowing disease progression, preserving function and ultimately reducing disease burden. The purpose of this study was to review prior research on the use of eye biomarkers and artificial intelligence (AI) for detecting AD and early AD. The PubMed database was searched to identify studies for review. Ocular biomarkers in AD research and AI research on AD were reviewed and summarized. According to numerous studies, there is a high likelihood that ocular biomarkers can be used to detect early AD: tears, corneal nerves, retina, visual function and, in particular, eye movement tracking have been identified as ocular biomarkers with the potential to detect early AD. However, there is currently no ocular biomarker that can be used to definitely detect early AD. A few studies that used AI with ocular biomarkers to detect AD reported promising results, demonstrating that using AI with ocular biomarkers through multimodal imaging could improve the accuracy of identifying AD patients. This strategy may become a screening tool for detecting early AD in older patients prior to the onset of AD symptoms.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Several studies have demonstrated that diet, gut microbiota, genetics and other patient factors are essential for disease occurrence and progression. Understanding the link between these factors is crucial for identifying molecular signatures that identify biomarkers to advance the management of IBD. Recent technological breakthroughs and data integration have fuelled the intensity of this research. This research demonstrates that the effect of diet depends on patient factors and gut microbial activity. It also identifies a range of potential biomarkers for IBD management, including mucosa-derived cytokines, gasdermins and neutrophil extracellular traps, all of which need further evaluation before clinical translation.

"37461616","Interpreting Cis -Regulatory Interactions from Large-Scale Deep Neural Networks for Genomics.","bioRxiv","The rise of large-scale, sequence-based deep neural networks (DNNs) for predicting gene expression has introduced challenges in their evaluation and interpretation. Current evaluations align DNN predictions with experimental perturbation assays, offering a limited perspective of the DNN's capabilities within the studied loci. Moreover, existing model explainability tools mainly focus on motif analysis, which becomes complex to interpret for longer sequences. Here we introduce CREME, anin silicoperturbation toolkit that interrogates large-scale DNNs to uncover rules of gene regulation that it has learned. Using CREME, we investigate Enformer, a prominent DNN in gene expression prediction, revealingcis-regulatory elements (CREs) that directly enhance or silence target genes. We explore the relationship between CRE distance from transcription start sites and gene expression, as well as the intricate complexity of higher-order CRE interactions. This work advances the ability to translate the powerful predictions of large-scale DNNs to study open questions in gene regulation."

"37440598","Parallels and contrasts between the cnidarian and bilaterian maternal-to-zygotic transition are revealed in Hydractinia embryos.","PLoS Genet","Embryogenesis requires coordinated gene regulatory activities early on that establish the trajectory of subsequent development, during a period called the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). The MZT comprises transcriptional activation of the embryonic genome and post-transcriptional regulation of egg-inherited maternal mRNA. Investigation into the MZT in animals has focused almost exclusively on bilaterians, which include all classical models such as flies, worms, sea urchin, and vertebrates, thus limiting our capacity to understand the gene regulatory paradigms uniting the MZT across all animals. Here, we elucidate the MZT of a non-bilaterian, the cnidarian Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus. Using parallel poly(A)-selected and non poly(A)-dependent RNA-seq approaches, we find that the Hydractinia MZT is composed of regulatory activities similar to many bilaterians, including cytoplasmic readenylation of maternally contributed mRNA, delayed genome activation, and separate phases of maternal mRNA deadenylation and degradation that likely depend on both maternally and zygotically encoded clearance factors, including microRNAs. But we also observe massive upregulation of histone genes and an expanded repertoire of predicted H4K20 methyltransferases, aspects thus far particular to the Hydractinia MZT and potentially underlying a novel mode of early embryonic chromatin regulation. Thus, similar regulatory strategies with taxon-specific elaboration underlie the MZT in both bilaterian and non-bilaterian embryos, providing insight into how an essential developmental transition may have arisen in ancestral animals.Copyright: © 2023 Ayers et al.

The aim of this study is to assess medical students' knowledge and awareness of RDs as well as their perceptions of potential measures to boost training in RDs. The cross-sectional survey was conducted at the Medical University of Plovdiv, Bulgaria, in 2019. The questionnaire contained 12 questions, divided into three main categories: (1) sociodemographic profile; (2) knowledge and awareness of RDs; and (3) attitudes about potential measures to improve training in RDs.A total of 1189 medical students completed the survey with an overall response rate of 56.4%. Only 13% of participants knew the correct definition of RDs, and a low overall level of awareness was found with regard to orphan drugs (20.3%) and genetic counselling and testing (0.5%). Respondents believed that society as a whole was largely unaware of RDs as a major public health issue. Students suggested elective courses, and invited lectures by RDs experts, and participation in research projects as the most preferred measures to improve undergraduate training.It is crucial to address the gaps in medical students' knowledge and awareness of RDs. University curricula should consider incorporating different RDs training modalities. It is essential to encourage various stakeholders to play a more proactive role and to collaborate in these activities. Involvement of patient organisations and advocacy groups might enhance students' knowledge of the challenges faced by people with RDs. Not least, the media should be partners in this important endeavour as well.© 2023. The Author(s)."

In the study, we found that NEP was abnormally increased in tubular epithelial cells of CKD patients, as well as unilateral ureteral obstruction and adenine diet-induced mice. Treatment with a United States Food and Drug Administration-approved NEP inhibitor Sacubitrilat (LBQ657) could alleviate ferroptosis, tubular injury, and delay the progression of kidney fibrosis in experimental mice. Similarly, genetic knockdown of NEP also inhibited tubular injury and fibrosis in transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 -induced tubular cells. Mechanically, NEP overexpression aggravated the ferroptotic and fibrotic phenotype, which was restored by acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4) knockdown. The NEP silencing attenuated TGF-β1-induced tubular cell ferroptosis and was exacerbated by ACSL4 overexpression. Collectively, for the first time, a novel aspect of NEP was explored in kidney fibrosis through ACSL4-mediated tubular epithelial cell ferroptosis.

We characterized protein-BMI trajectory associations in adolescents and adults and how these connect to other omics layers.Our study included two cohorts of longitudinally followed twins: FinnTwin12 (N=651) and the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR) (N=665). Follow-up comprised four BMI measurements over approximately 6 (NTR: 23-27 years old) to 10 years (FinnTwin12: 12-22 years old), with omics data collected at the last BMI measurement. BMI changes were calculated using latent growth curve models. Mixed-effects models were used to quantify the associations between the abundance of 439 plasma proteins with BMI at blood sampling and changes in BMI. The sources of genetic and environmental variation underlying the protein abundances were quantified using twin models, as were the associations of proteins with BMI and BMI changes. In NTR, we investigated the association of gene expression of genes encoding proteins identified in FinnTwin12 with BMI and changes in BMI. We linked identified proteins and their coding genes to plasma metabolites and polygenic risk scores (PRS) using mixed-effect models and correlation networks.We identified 66 and 14 proteins associated with BMI at blood sampling and changes in BMI, respectively. The average heritability of these proteins was 35%. Of the 66 BMI-protein associations, 43 and 12 showed genetic and environmental correlations, respectively, including 8 proteins showing both. Similarly, we observed 6 and 4 genetic and environmental correlations between changes in BMI and protein abundance, respectively.S100A8gene expression was associated with BMI at blood sampling, and thePRG4andCFIgenes were associated with BMI changes. Proteins showed strong connections with many metabolites and PRSs, but we observed no multi-omics connections among gene expression and other omics layers.Associations between the proteome and BMI trajectories are characterized by shared genetic, environmental, and metabolic etiologies. We observed few gene-protein pairs associated with BMI or changes in BMI at the proteome and transcriptome levels."

Various methyltransferases have been linked to heart disease, through disrupted expression and activity, and genetic variants associated with congenital heart disease. However, in vivo functional data for many of the methyltransferases in the context of the heart are limited. Here, we used theDrosophilamodel system to investigate different histone 3 lysine 36 (H3K36) methyltransferases for their role in heart development. The data show thatDrosophilaAsh1 is the functional homolog of human ASH1L in the heart. Both Ash1 and Set2 H3K36 methyltransferases are required for heart structure and function during development. Furthermore, Ash1-mediated H3K36 methylation (H3K36me2) is essential for healthy heart function, which depends on both Ash1-complex components, Caf1-55 and MRG15, together. These findings provide in vivo functional data for Ash1 and its complex, and Set2, in the context of H3K36 methylation in the heart, and support a role for their mammalian homologs, ASH1L with RBBP4 and MORF4L1, and SETD2, during heart development and disease."
"37413719","Matched tissue and liquid biopsies for advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients A potentially indispensable complementary approach.","Transl Oncol","The introduction of liquid biopsies (LB) has brought forth a number of therapeutic opportunities into the domain of thoracic oncology. Many of which have been adopted for care of patients presenting with advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (aNS-NSCLC). For example, one of the most frequent indications to perform a LB in these patients, at least in Europe, is for patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting EGFR and ALK genomic alterations when the tumor progresses. A tissue biopsy (TB) must then be taken, ideally from a site of a tumor that progresses, in particular if the LB does not permit detection of a mechanism of resistance to TKI. A LB from a patient with aNS-NSCLC is recommended before first-line therapy if no tissue and/or cytological material is accessible or if the extracted nucleic acid is insufficient in amount and/or of poor quality. At present a LB and a TB are rarely performed simultaneously before treatment and/or on tumor progression. This complementary/matched testing approach is still controversial but needs to be better evaluated to determine the true benefit to care of patients. This review provides an update on the complementarity of the LB and TB method for care of patients presenting with aNS-NSCLC.Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier Inc."

"37511178",NA,NA,"Endocrine-resistant, hormone receptor-positive, and HER2-negative (HR+/HER2-) metastatic breast cancer (mBC) is largely governed by acquired mutations in the estrogen receptor, which promote ligand-independent activation, and by truncal alterations in the PI3K signaling pathway, with a broader range of gene alterations occurring with less prevalence. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)-based technologies are progressively permeating the clinical setting. However, their utility for serial monitoring has been hindered by their significant costs, inter-technique variability, and real-world patient heterogeneity. We interrogated a longitudinal collection of 180 plasma samples from 75 HR+/HER2- mBC patients who progressed or relapsed after exposure to aromatase inhibitors and were subsequently treated with endocrine therapy (ET) by means of highly sensitive and affordable digital PCR and SafeSEQ sequencing. BaselinePIK3CAandTP53mutations were prognostic of a shorter progression-free survival in our population. MutantPIK3CAwas prognostic in the subset of patients receiving fulvestrant monotherapy after progression to a CDK4/6 inhibitor (CDK4/6i)-containing regimen, and its suppression was predictive in a case of long-term benefit with alpelisib. MutantESR1was prognostic in patients who did not receive concurrent CDK4/6i, an impact influenced by the variant allele frequency, and its early suppression was strongly predictive of efficacy and associated with long-term benefit in the whole cohort. Mutations inESR1,TP53, andKRASemerged as putative drivers of acquired resistance. These findings collectively contribute to the characterization of longitudinal ctDNA in real-world cases of HR+/HER2- mBC previously exposed to aromatase inhibitors and support ongoing studies either targeting actionable alterations or leveraging the ultra-sensitive tracking of ctDNA."

"37425850","Small allelic variants are a source of ancestral bias in structural variant breakpoint placement.","bioRxiv","High-quality genome assemblies and sophisticated algorithms have increased sensitivity for a wide range of variant types, and breakpoint accuracy for structural variants (SVs, ≥ 50 bp) has improved to near basepair precision. Despite these advances, many SVs in unique regions of the genome are subject to systematic bias that affects breakpoint location. This ambiguity leads to less accurate variant comparisons across samples, and it obscures true breakpoint features needed for mechanistic inferences. To understand why SVs are not consistently placed, we re-analyzed 64 phased haplotypes constructed from long-read assemblies released by the Human Genome Structural Variation Consortium (HGSVC). We identified variable breakpoints for 882 SV insertions and 180 SV deletions not anchored in tandem repeats (TRs) or segmental duplications (SDs). While this is unexpectedly high for genome assemblies in unique loci, we find read-based callsets from the same sequencing data yielded 1,566 insertions and 986 deletions with inconsistent breakpoints also not anchored in TRs or SDs. When we investigated causes for breakpoint inaccuracy, we found sequence and assembly errors had minimal impact, but we observed a strong effect of ancestry. We confirmed that polymorphic mismatches and small indels are enriched at shifted breakpoints and that these polymorphisms are generally lost when breakpoints shift. Long tracts of homology, such as SVs mediated by transposable elements, increase the likelihood of imprecise SV calls and the distance they are shifted. Tandem Duplication (TD) breakpoints are the most heavily affected SV class with 14% of TDs placed at different locations across haplotypes. While graph genome methods normalize SV calls across many samples, the resulting breakpoints are sometimes incorrect, highlighting a need to tune graph methods for breakpoint accuracy. The breakpoint inconsistencies we characterize collectively affect ∼5% of the SVs called in a human genome and underscore a need for algorithm development to improve SV databases, mitigate the impact of ancestry on breakpoint placement, and increase the value of callsets for investigating mutational processes."
"37401440","The Effect of Methodological Considerations on the Construction of Gene-Based Plant Pan-genomes.","Genome Biol Evol","Pan-genomics is an emerging approach for studying the genetic diversity within plant populations. In contrast to common resequencing studies that compare whole genome sequencing data with a single reference genome, the construction of a pan-genome (PG) involves the direct comparison of multiple genomes to one another, thereby enabling the detection of genomic sequences and genes not present in the reference, as well as the analysis of gene content diversity. Although multiple studies describing PGs of various plant species have been published in recent years, a better understanding regarding the effect of the computational procedures used for PG construction could guide researchers in making more informed methodological decisions. Here, we examine the effect of several key methodological factors on the obtained gene pool and on gene presence-absence detections by constructing and comparing multiple PGs of Arabidopsis thaliana and cultivated soybean, as well as conducting a meta-analysis on published PGs. These factors include the construction method, the sequencing depth, and the extent of input data used for gene annotation. We observe substantial differences between PGs constructed using three common procedures (de novo assembly and annotation, map-to-pan, and iterative assembly) and that results are dependent on the extent of the input data. Specifically, we report low agreement between the gene content inferred using different procedures and input data. Our results should increase the awareness of the community to the consequences of methodological decisions made during the process of PG construction and emphasize the need for further investigation of commonly applied methodologies.© The Author(s) 2023.

However, we identified that this signal mediates PD risk via expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mechanisms. While previously identifiedGBA1associated disease risk variants are coding mutations, here we suggest a novel functional mechanism consistent with a trend in decreasing glucocerebrosidase activity levels. Given the high population frequency of the underlying signal and the phenotypic characteristics of the homozygous carriers, we hypothesize that this variant may not cause Gaucher disease. Additionally, the prevalence of Gaucher's disease in Africa is low.The present study identifies a novel African-ancestry genetic risk factor inGBA1as a major mechanistic basis of PD in the African and African admixed populations. This striking result contrasts to previous work in Northern European populations, both in terms of mechanism and attributable risk. This finding highlights the importance of understanding population-specific genetic risk in complex diseases, a particularly crucial point as the field moves toward precision medicine in PD clinical trials and while recognizing the need for equitable inclusion of ancestrally diverse groups in such trials. Given the distinctive genetics of these underrepresented populations, their inclusion represents a valuable step towards insights into novel genetic determinants underlying PD etiology. This opens new avenues towards RNA-based and other therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing lifetime risk.Our current understanding of Parkinson's disease (PD) is disproportionately based on studying populations of European ancestry, leading to a significant gap in our knowledge about the genetics, clinical characteristics, and pathophysiology in underrepresented populations. This is particularly notable in individuals of African and African admixed ancestries. Over the last two decades, we have witnessed a revolution in the research area of complex genetic diseases. In the PD field, large-scale genome-wide association studies in the European, Asian, and Latin American populations have identified multiple risk loci associated with disease. These include 78 loci and 90 independent signals associated with PD risk in the European population, nine replicated loci and two novel population-specific signals in the Asian population, and a total of 11 novel loci recently nominated through multi-ancestry GWAS efforts.Nevertheless, the African and African admixed populations remain completely unexplored in the context of PD genetics.To address the lack of diversity in our research field, this study aimed to conduct the first genome-wide assessment of PD genetics in the African and African admixed populations. Here, we identified a genetic risk factor linked to PD etiology, dissected African-specific differences in risk and age at onset, characterized known genetic risk factors, and highlighted the utility of the African and African admixed risk haplotype substructure for future fine-mapping efforts. We identified a novel disease mechanism via expression changes consistent with decreasedGBA1activity levels. Future large scale single cell expression studies should investigate the neuronal populations in which expression differences are most prominent. This novel mechanism may hold promise for future efficient RNA-based therapeutic strategies such as antisense oligonucleotides or short interfering RNAs aimed at preventing and decreasing disease risk. We envisage that these data generated under the umbrella of the Global Parkinson's Genetics Program (GP2) will shed light on the molecular mechanisms involved in the disease process and might pave the way for future clinical trials and therapeutic interventions. This work represents a valuable resource in an underserved population, supporting pioneering research within GP2 and beyond. Deciphering causal and genetic risk factors in all these ancestries will help determine whether interventions, potential targets for disease modifying treatment, and prevention strategies that are being studied in the European populations are relevant to the African and African admixed populations.We nominate a novel signal impactingGBA1as the major genetic risk factor for PD in the African and African admixed populations. The present study could inform futureGBA1clinical trials, improving patient stratification. In this regard, genetic testing can help to design trials likely to provide meaningful and actionable answers. It is our hope that these findings may ultimately have clinical utility for this underrepresented population."
"37497775","Breaking enhancers to gain insights into developmental defects.","Elife","Despite ground-breaking genetic studies that have identified thousands of risk variants for developmental diseases, how these variants lead to molecular and cellular phenotypes remains a gap in knowledge. Many of these variants are non-coding and occur at enhancers, which orchestrate key regulatory programs during development. The prevailing paradigm is that non-coding variants alter the activity of enhancers, impacting gene expression programs, and ultimately contributing to disease risk. A key obstacle to progress is the systematic functional characterization of non-coding variants at scale, especially since enhancer activity is highly specific to cell type and developmental stage. Here, we review the foundational studies of enhancers in developmental disease and current genomic approaches to functionally characterize developmental enhancers and their variants at scale. In the coming decade, we anticipate systematic enhancer perturbation studies to link non-coding variants to molecular mechanisms, changes in cell state, and disease phenotypes.© 2023, Armendariz, Sundarrajan et al."
"37407873","MECOM Deficiency: from Bone Marrow Failure to Impaired B-Cell Development.","J Clin Immunol","MECOM deficiency is a recently identified inborn error of immunity and inherited bone marrow failure syndrome caused by haploinsufficiency of the hematopoietic transcription factor MECOM. It is unique among inherited bone marrow failure syndromes, many of which present during later childhood or adolescence, because of the early age of onset and severity of the pancytopenia, emphasizing the importance and gene dose dependency of MECOM during hematopoiesis. B-cell lymphopenia and hypogammaglobulinemia have been described in a subset of patients with MECOM deficiency. While the mechanisms underlying the B-cell deficiency are currently unknown, recent work has provided mechanistic insights into the function of MECOM in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) maintenance. MECOM binds to regulatory enhancers that control the expression of a network of genes essential for HSC maintenance and self-renewal. Heterozygous mutations, as seen in MECOM-deficient bone marrow failure, lead to dysregulated MECOM network expression. Extra-hematopoietic manifestations of MECOM deficiency, including renal and cardiac anomalies, radioulnar synostosis, clinodactyly, and hearing loss, have been reported. Individuals with specific genotypes have some of the systemic manifestations with isolated mild thrombocytopenia or without hematologic abnormalities, highlighting the tissue specificity of mutations in some MECOM domains. Those infants with MECOM-associated bone marrow failure require HSC transplantation for survival. Here, we review the expanding cohort of patient phenotypes and accompanying genotypes resulting in MECOM deficiency, and the proposed mechanisms underlying MECOM regulation of human HSC maintenance and B-cell development.© 2023.

"37390819","Base editor screens for in situ mutational scanning at scale.","Mol Cell","A fundamental challenge in biology is understanding the molecular details of protein function. How mutations alter protein activity, regulation, and response to drugs is of critical importance to human health. Recent years have seen the emergence of pooled base editor screens for in situ mutational scanning: the interrogation of protein sequence-function relationships by directly perturbing endogenous proteins in live cells. These studies have revealed the effects of disease-associated mutations, discovered novel drug resistance mechanisms, and generated biochemical insights into protein function. Here, we discuss how this ""base editor scanning"" approach has been applied to diverse biological questions, compare it with alternative techniques, and describe the emerging challenges that must be addressed to maximize its utility. Given its broad applicability toward profiling mutations across the proteome, base editor scanning promises to revolutionize the investigation of proteins in their native contexts.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

"37516747","Guided construction of single cell reference for human and mouse lung.","Nat Commun","Accurate cell type identification is a key and rate-limiting step in single-cell data analysis. Single-cell references with comprehensive cell types, reproducible and functionally validated cell identities, and common nomenclatures are much needed by the research community for automated cell type annotation, data integration, and data sharing. Here, we develop a computational pipeline utilizing the LungMAP CellCards as a dictionary to consolidate single-cell transcriptomic datasets of 104 human lungs and 17 mouse lung samples to construct LungMAP single-cell reference (CellRef) for both normal human and mouse lungs. CellRefs define 48 human and 40 mouse lung cell types catalogued from diverse anatomic locations and developmental time points. We demonstrate the accuracy and stability of LungMAP CellRefs and their utility for automated cell type annotation of both normal and diseased lungs using multiple independent methods and testing data. We develop user-friendly web interfaces for easy access and maximal utilization of the LungMAP CellRefs.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37465668","Cell type- and time-dependent biological responses in ex vivo perfused lung grafts.","Front Immunol","In response to the increasing demand for lung transplantation,ex vivolung perfusion (EVLP) has extended the number of suitable donor lungs by rehabilitating marginal organs. However despite an expanding use in clinical practice, the responses of the different lung cell types to EVLP are not known. In order to advance our mechanistic understanding and establish a refine tool for improvement of EVLP, we conducted a pioneer study involving single cell RNA-seq on human lungs declined for transplantation. Functional enrichment analyses were performed upon integration of data sets generated at 4 h (clinical duration) and 10 h (prolonged duration) from two human lungs processed to EVLP. Pathways related to inflammation were predicted activated in epithelial and blood endothelial cells, in monocyte-derived macrophages and temporally at 4 h in alveolar macrophages. Pathways related to cytoskeleton signaling/organization were predicted reduced in most cell types mainly at 10 h. We identified a division of labor between cell types for the selected expression of cytokine and chemokine genes that varied according to time. Immune cells including CD4+and CD8+T cells, NK cells, mast cells and conventional dendritic cells displayed gene expression patterns indicating blunted activation, already at 4 h in several instances and further more at 10 h. Therefore despite inducing inflammatory responses, EVLP appears to dampen the activation of major lung immune cell types, what may be beneficial to the outcome of transplantation. Our results also support that therapeutics approaches aiming at reducing inflammation upon EVLP should target both the alveolar and vascular compartments.Copyright © 2023 Gouin, Vu Manh, Jouneau, Bevilacqua, De Wolf, Glorion, Hannouche, Urien, Estephan, Roux, Magnan, Le Guen, Da Costa, Chevalier, Descamps, Schwartz-Cornil, Dalod and Sage."

"37488607","COVID-19 annual update: a narrative review.","Hum Genomics","Three and a half years after the pandemic outbreak, now that WHO has formally declared that the emergency is over, COVID-19 is still a significant global issue. Here, we focus on recent developments in genetic and genomic research on COVID-19, and we give an outlook on state-of-the-art therapeutical approaches, as the pandemic is gradually transitioning to an endemic situation. The sequencing and characterization of rare alleles in different populations has made it possible to identify numerous genes that affect either susceptibility to COVID-19 or the severity of the disease. These findings provide a beginning to new avenues and pan-ethnic therapeutic approaches, as well as to potential genetic screening protocols. The causative virus, SARS-CoV-2, is still in the spotlight, but novel threatening virus could appear anywhere at any time. Therefore, continued vigilance and further research is warranted. We also note emphatically that to prevent future pandemics and other world-wide health crises, it is imperative to capitalize on what we have learnt from COVID-19: specifically, regarding its origins, the world's response, and insufficient preparedness. This requires unprecedented international collaboration and timely data sharing for the coordination of effective response and the rapid implementation of containment measures.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Patients with NSCLC have a poor prognosis for various factors, and a late diagnosis is one of them. The DNA methylation of CpG island sequences found in the promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes has recently received attention as a potential biomarker of human cancer. In this study, we report DNA methylation changes of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1), which belongs to the ATP cassette transporter family in NSCLC patients. Our results demonstrate that ABCG1 is hyper-methylation in NSCLC samples, and these changes are negatively correlated to gene and protein expression. Furthermore, the expression of the ABCG1 gene is significantly associated with the survival time of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients; however, it did not show a correlation to overall survival (OS) of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) patients. Notably, we found ABCG1 methylation status at locus cg20214535 is strongly associated with the survival time and consistently observed hyper-methylation in LUAD samples. This novel finding suggests ABCG1 is a potential candidate for targeted therapy in lung cancer via this specific probe. In addition, we illustrate the protein-protein interaction (PPI) of ABCG1 with other proteins and the strong communication of ABCG1 with immune cells.© 2023.
