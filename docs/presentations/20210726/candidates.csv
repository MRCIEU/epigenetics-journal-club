No,20210726,Cell types,34254878,A comparison of epithelial cell content of oral samples estimated using cytology and DNA methylation.,Epigenetics,"Saliva and buccal samples are popular for epigenome wide association studies (EWAS) due to their ease of collection compared and their ability to sample a different cell lineage compared to blood. As these samples contain a mix of white blood cells and buccal epithelial cells that can vary within a population, this cellular heterogeneity may confound EWAS. This has been addressed by including cellular heterogeneity obtained through cytology at the time of collection or by using cellular deconvolution algorithms built on epigenetic data from specific cell types. However, to our knowledge, the two methods have not yet been compared. Here we show that the two methods are highly correlated in saliva and buccal samples (R = 0.84, P < 0.0001) by comparing data generated from cytological staining and Infinium MethylationEPIC arrays and the EpiDISH deconvolution algorithm from buccal and saliva samples collected from twenty adults. In addition, by using an expanded dataset from both sample types, we confirmed our previous finding that age has strong, non-linear negative correlation with epithelial cell proportion in both sample types. However, children and adults showed a large within-population variation in cellular heterogeneity. Our results validate the use of the EpiDISH algorithm in estimating the effect of cellular heterogeneity in EWAS and showed DNA methylation generally underestimates the epithelial cell content obtained from cytology."
No,20210726,DNAm age,34174924,Novel epigenetic clock for fetal brain development predicts prenatal age for cellular stem cell models and derived neurons.,Mol Brain,"Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and their differentiated neurons (iPSC-neurons) are a widely used cellular model in the research of the central nervous system. However, it is unknown how well they capture age-associated processes, particularly given that pluripotent cells are only present during the earliest stages of mammalian development. Epigenetic clocks utilize coordinated age-associated changes in DNA methylation to make predictions that correlate strongly with chronological age. It has been shown that the induction of pluripotency rejuvenates predicted epigenetic age. As existing clocks are not optimized for the study of brain development, we developed the fetal brain clock (FBC), a bespoke epigenetic clock trained in human prenatal brain samples in order to investigate more precisely the epigenetic age of iPSCs and iPSC-neurons. The FBC was tested in two independent validation cohorts across a total of 194 samples, confirming that the FBC outperforms other established epigenetic clocks in fetal brain cohorts. We applied the FBC to DNA methylation data from iPSCs and embryonic stem cells and their derived neuronal precursor cells and neurons, finding that these cell types are epigenetically characterized as having an early fetal age. Furthermore, while differentiation from iPSCs to neurons significantly increases epigenetic age, iPSC-neurons are still predicted as being fetal. Together our findings reiterate the need to better understand the limitations of existing epigenetic clocks for answering biological research questions and highlight a limitation of iPSC-neurons as a cellular model of age-related diseases."
No,20210726,DNAm age,34187551,Genome-wide association studies identify 137 genetic loci for DNA methylation biomarkers of aging.,Genome Biol,"Biological aging estimators derived from DNA methylation data are heritable and correlate with morbidity and mortality. Consequently, identification of genetic and environmental contributors to the variation in these measures in populations has become a major goal in the field.Leveraging DNA methylation and SNP data from more than 40,000 individuals, we identify 137 genome-wide significant loci, of which 113 are novel, from genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analyses of four epigenetic clocks and epigenetic surrogate markers for granulocyte proportions and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 levels, respectively. We find evidence for shared genetic loci associated with the Horvath clock and expression of transcripts encoding genes linked to lipid metabolism and immune function. Notably, these loci are independent of those reported to regulate DNA methylation levels at constituent clock CpGs. A polygenic score for GrimAge acceleration showed strong associations with adiposity-related traits, educational attainment, parental longevity, and C-reactive protein levels.This study illuminates the genetic architecture underlying epigenetic aging and its shared genetic contributions with lifestyle factors and longevity."
No,20210726,Epigenetics,34234345,BANP opens chromatin and activates CpG-island-regulated genes.,Nature,"The majority of gene transcripts generated by RNA polymerase II in mammalian genomes initiate at CpG island (CGI) promoters1,2, yet our understanding of their regulation remains limited. This is in part due to the incomplete information that we have on transcription factors, their DNA-binding motifs and which genomic binding sites are functional in any given cell type3-5. In addition, there are orphan motifs without known binders, such as the CGCG element, which is associated with highly expressed genes across human tissues and enriched near the transcription start site of a subset of CGI promoters6-8. Here we combine single-molecule footprinting with interaction proteomics to identify BTG3-associated nuclear protein (BANP) as the transcription factor that binds this element in the mouse and human genome. We show that BANP is a strong CGI activator that controls essential metabolic genes in pluripotent stem and terminally differentiated neuronal cells. BANP binding is repelled by DNA methylation of its motif in vitro and in vivo, which epigenetically restricts most binding to CGIs and accounts for differential binding at aberrantly methylated CGI promoters in cancer cells. Upon binding to an unmethylated motif, BANP opens chromatin and phases nucleosomes. These findings establish BANP as a critical activator of a set of essential genes and suggest a model in which the activity of CGI promoters relies on methylation-sensitive transcription factors that are capable of chromatin opening."
No,20210726,EWAS,34215292,Ageing-associated changes in DNA methylation in X and Y chromosomes.,Epigenetics Chromatin,"Ageing displays clear sexual dimorphism, evident in both morbidity and mortality. Ageing is also associated with changes in DNA methylation, but very little focus has been on the sex chromosomes, potential biological contributors to the observed sexual dimorphism. Here, we sought to identify DNA methylation changes associated with ageing in the Y and X chromosomes, by utilizing datasets available in data repositories, comprising in total of 1240 males and 1191 females, aged 14-92 years.In total, we identified 46 age-associated CpG sites in the male Y, 1327 age-associated CpG sites in the male X, and 325 age-associated CpG sites in the female X. The X chromosomal age-associated CpGs showed significant overlap between females and males, with 122 CpGs identified as age-associated in both sexes. Age-associated X chromosomal CpGs in both sexes were enriched in CpG islands and depleted from gene bodies and showed no strong trend towards hypermethylation nor hypomethylation. In contrast, the Y chromosomal age-associated CpGs were enriched in gene bodies, and showed a clear trend towards hypermethylation with age.Significant overlap in X chromosomal age-associated CpGs identified in males and females and their shared features suggest that despite the uneven chromosomal dosage, differences in ageing-associated DNA methylation changes in the X chromosome are unlikely to be a major contributor of sex dimorphism in ageing. While age-associated CpGs showed good replication across datasets in the present study, only a limited set of previously reported age-associated CpGs were replicated. One contributor to the limited overlap are differences in the age range of individuals included in each data set. Further study is needed to identify biologically significant age-associated CpGs in the sex chromosomes."
No,20210726,Hydroxymethylation,34253716,Tissue-specific 5-hydroxymethylcytosine landscape of the human genome.,Nat Commun,"5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is an important epigenetic mark that regulates gene expression. Charting the landscape of 5hmC in human tissues is fundamental to understanding its regulatory functions. Here, we systematically profiled the whole-genome 5hmC landscape at single-base resolution for 19 types of human tissues. We found that 5hmC preferentially decorates gene bodies and outperforms gene body 5mC in reflecting gene expression. Approximately one-third of 5hmC peaks are tissue-specific differentially-hydroxymethylated regions (tsDhMRs), which are deposited in regions that potentially regulate the expression of nearby tissue-specific functional genes. In addition, tsDhMRs are enriched with tissue-specific transcription factors and may rewire tissue-specific gene expression networks. Moreover, tsDhMRs are associated with single-nucleotide polymorphisms identified by genome-wide association studies and are linked to tissue-specific phenotypes and diseases. Collectively, our results show the tissue-specific 5hmC landscape of the human genome and demonstrate that 5hmC serves as a fundamental regulatory element affecting tissue-specific gene expression programs and functions.© 2021.

No,20210726,Methods,34256818,2dFDR: a new approach to confounder adjustment substantially increases detection power in omics association studies.,Genome Biol,"One challenge facing omics association studies is the loss of statistical power when adjusting for confounders and multiple testing. The traditional statistical procedure involves fitting a confounder-adjusted regression model for each omics feature, followed by multiple testing correction. Here we show that the traditional procedure is not optimal and present a new approach, 2dFDR, a two-dimensional false discovery rate control procedure, for powerful confounder adjustment in multiple testing. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that 2dFDR is more powerful than the traditional procedure, and in the presence of strong confounding and weak signals, the power improvement could be more than 100%.© 2021.

No,20210726,Prediction,34204621,DNA Methylation-Based Estimates of Circulating Leukocyte Composition for Predicting Colorectal Cancer Survival: A Prospective Cohort Study.,Cancers (Basel),"Leukocytes are involved in the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). The proportion of six major leukocyte subtypes can be estimated using epigenome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) data from stored blood samples. Whether the composition of circulating leukocytes can be used as a prognostic factor is unclear. DNAm-based leukocyte proportions were obtained from a prospective cohort of 2206 CRC patients. Multivariate Cox regression models and survival curves were applied to assess associations between leukocyte composition and survival outcomes. A higher proportion of lymphocytes, including CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, and NK cells, was associated with better survival, while a higher proportion of neutrophils was associated with poorer survival. CD4+ T cells outperformed other leukocytes in estimating the patients' prognosis. Comparing the highest quantile to the lowest quantile of CD4+ T cells, hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) of all-cause and CRC-specific mortality were 0.59 (0.48, 0.72) and 0.59 (0.45, 0.77), respectively. Furthermore, the association of CD4+ T cells and prognosis was stronger among patients with early or intermediate CRC or patients with colon cancer. In conclusion, the composition of circulating leukocytes estimated from DNAm, particularly the proportions of CD4+ T cells, could be used as promising independent predictors of CRC survival."
No,20210726,Prediction,34247653,DNA methylation under the major depression pathway predicts pediatric quality of life four-month post-pediatric mild traumatic brain injury.,Clin Epigenetics,"Major depression has been recognized as the most commonly diagnosed psychiatric complication of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Moreover, major depression is associated with poor outcomes following mTBI; however, the underlying biological mechanisms of this are largely unknown. Recently, genomic and epigenetic factors have been increasingly implicated in the recovery following TBI.This study leveraged DNA methylation within the major depression pathway, along with demographic and behavior measures (features used in the clinical model) to predict post-concussive symptom burden and quality of life four-month post-injury in a cohort of 110 pediatric mTBI patients and 87 age-matched healthy controls. The results demonstrated that including DNA methylation markers in the major depression pathway improved the prediction accuracy for quality of life but not persistent post-concussive symptom burden. Specifically, the prediction accuracy (i.e., the correlation between the predicted value and observed value) of quality of life was improved from 0.59 (p = 1.20 × 10-3) (clinical model) to 0.71 (p = 3.89 × 10-5); the identified cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites were mainly in the open sea regions and the mapped genes were related to TBI in several molecular studies. Moreover, depression symptoms were a strong predictor (with large weights) for both post-concussive symptom burden and pediatric quality of life.This study emphasized that both molecular and behavioral manifestations of depression symptoms played a prominent role in predicting the recovery process following pediatric mTBI, suggesting the urgent need to further study TBI-caused depression symptoms for better recovery outcome.© 2021.

Yes,20210726,EWAS,34167563,The epigenetic etiology of cardiovascular disease in a longitudinal Swedish twin study.,Clin Epigenetics,"Studies on DNA methylation have the potential to discover mechanisms of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. However, the role of DNA methylation in CVD etiology remains unclear.We performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) on CVD in a longitudinal sample of Swedish twins (535 individuals). We selected CpGs reaching the Bonferroni-corrected significance level (2 [Formula: see text] 10-7) or the top-ranked 20 CpGs with the lowest P values if they did not reach this significance level in EWAS analysis associated with non-stroke CVD, overall stroke, and ischemic stroke, respectively. We further applied a bivariate autoregressive latent trajectory model with structured residuals (ALT-SR) to evaluate the cross-lagged effect between DNA methylation of these CpGs and cardiometabolic traits (blood lipids, blood pressure, and body mass index). Furthermore, mediation analysis was performed to evaluate whether the cross-lagged effects had causal impacts on CVD. In the EWAS models, none of the CpGs we selected reached the Bonferroni-corrected significance level. The ALT-SR model showed that DNA methylation levels were more likely to predict the subsequent level of cardiometabolic traits rather than the other way around (numbers of significant cross-lagged paths of methylation → trait/trait → methylation were 84/4, 45/6, 66/1 for the identified three CpG sets, respectively). Finally, we demonstrated significant indirect effects from DNA methylation on CVD mediated by cardiometabolic traits.We present evidence for a directional association from DNA methylation on cardiometabolic traits and CVD, rather than the opposite, highlighting the role of epigenetics in CVD development."
Yes,20210726,EWAS,34170065,Neonatal DNA methylation and childhood low prosocial behavior: An epigenome-wide association meta-analysis.,Am J Med Genet B Neuropsychiatr Genet,"Low prosocial behavior in childhood has been consistently linked to later psychopathology, with evidence supporting the influence of both genetic and environmental factors on its development. Although neonatal DNA methylation (DNAm) has been found to prospectively associate with a range of psychological traits in childhood, its potential role in prosocial development has yet to be investigated. This study investigated prospective associations between cord blood DNAm at birth and low prosocial behavior within and across four longitudinal birth cohorts from the Pregnancy And Childhood Epigenetics (PACE) Consortium. We examined (a) developmental trajectories of ""chronic-low"" versus ""typical"" prosocial behavior across childhood in a case-control design (N = 2,095), and (b) continuous ""low prosocial"" scores at comparable cross-cohort time-points (N = 2,121). Meta-analyses were performed to examine differentially methylated positions and regions. At the cohort-specific level, three CpGs were found to associate with chronic low prosocial behavior; however, none of these associations was replicated in another cohort. Meta-analysis revealed no epigenome-wide significant CpGs or regions. Overall, we found no evidence for associations between DNAm patterns at birth and low prosocial behavior across childhood. Findings highlight the importance of employing multi-cohort approaches to replicate epigenetic associations and reduce the risk of false positive discoveries.© 2021 The Authors.

Yes,20210726,EWAS,34174944,Detecting cord blood cell type-specific epigenetic associations with gestational diabetes mellitus and early childhood growth.,Clin Epigenetics,"Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) have provided opportunities to understand the role of epigenetic mechanisms in development and pathophysiology of many chronic diseases. However, an important limitation of conventional EWAS is that profiles of epigenetic variability are often obtained in samples of mixed cell types. Here, we aim to assess whether changes in cord blood DNA methylation (DNAm) associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) exposure and early childhood growth markers occur in a cell type-specific manner.We analyzed 275 cord blood samples collected at delivery from a prospective pre-birth cohort with genome-wide DNAm profiled by the Illumina MethylationEPIC array. We estimated proportions of seven common cell types in each sample using a cord blood-specific DNAm reference panel. Leveraging a recently developed approach named CellDMC, we performed cell type-specific EWAS to identify CpG loci significantly associated with GDM, or 3-year-old body mass index (BMI) z-score. A total of 1410 CpG loci displayed significant cell type-specific differences in methylation level between 23 GDM cases and 252 controls with a false discovery rate < 0.05. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis indicated that LDL transportation emerged from CpG specifically identified from B-cells DNAm analyses and the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway emerged from CpG specifically identified from natural killer cells DNAm analyses. In addition, we identified four and six loci associated with 3-year-old BMI z-score that were specific to CD8+ T-cells and monocytes, respectively. By performing genome-wide permutation tests, we validated that most of our detected signals had low false positive rates.Compared to conventional EWAS adjusting for the effects of cell type heterogeneity, the proposed approach based on cell type-specific EWAS could provide additional biologically meaningful associations between CpG methylation, prenatal maternal GDM or 3-year-old BMI. With careful validation, these findings may provide new insights into the pathogenesis, programming, and consequences of related childhood metabolic dysregulation. Therefore, we propose that cell type-specific analyses are worth cautious explorations."
Yes,20210726,EWAS,34183656,A multi-ethnic epigenome-wide association study of leukocyte DNA methylation and blood lipids.,Nat Commun,"Here we examine the association between DNA methylation in circulating leukocytes and blood lipids in a multi-ethnic sample of 16,265 subjects. We identify 148, 35, and 4 novel associations among Europeans, African Americans, and Hispanics, respectively, and an additional 186 novel associations through a trans-ethnic meta-analysis. We observe a high concordance in the direction of effects across racial/ethnic groups, a high correlation of effect sizes between high-density lipoprotein and triglycerides, a modest overlap of associations with epigenome-wide association studies of other cardio-metabolic traits, and a largely non-overlap with lipid loci identified to date through genome-wide association studies. Thirty CpGs reached significance in at least 2 racial/ethnic groups including 7 that showed association with the expression of an annotated gene. CpGs annotated to CPT1A showed evidence of being influenced by triglycerides levels. DNA methylation levels of circulating leukocytes show robust and consistent association with blood lipid levels across multiple racial/ethnic groups."
Yes,20210726,EWAS,34214161,DNA Methylation Changes Associated with Type 2 Diabetes and Diabetic Kidney Disease in an East Asian Population.,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,"There is a growing body of evidence that epigenetic changes including DNA methylation influence the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and its microvascular complications. We conducted a methylome-wide association study (MWAS) to identify differentially methylated sites (DMSs) of T2D and diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in a Korean population.We performed an MWAS in 232 participants with T2D and 197 non-diabetic controls with Illumina EPIC bead chip using peripheral blood leukocytes. T2D group was subdivided into 87 DKD cases and 80 non-DKD controls. Additional 819 individuals from two population-based cohorts were used to investigate the association of identified DMSs with quantitative metabolic phenotypes. Mendelian randomization (MR) approach was applied to evaluate the causal effect of metabolic phenotypes on identified DMSs.We identified eight DMSs (each at BMP8A, NBPF20, STX18, ZNF365, CPT1A, and TRIM37, and two at TXNIP) which were significantly associated with the risk of T2D (P < 9.0×10 -8), including three that were previously known (DMSs in TXNIP and CPT1A). We also identified three DMSs (in COMMD1, TMOD1, and FHOD1) associated with DKD. With our limited sample size, we were not able to observe a significant overlap between DMSs of T2D and DKD. DMSs in TXNIP and CTP1A were associated with fasting glucose and HbA1c. In MR analysis, fasting glucose was causally associated with DMS in CPT1A.In an East Asian population, we identified eight DMSs, including five novel CpG loci, associated with T2D and three DMSs associated with DKD at methylome-wide statistical significance.© The Author(s) 2021.

Yes,20210726,EWAS,34221714,Methylation of CYP1A1 and VKORC1 promoter associated with stable dosage of warfarin in Chinese patients.,PeerJ,"To investigate the association between DNA methylation and the stable warfarin dose through genome-wide DNA methylation analysis and pyrosequencing assay.This study included 161 patients and genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was used to screen potential warfarin dose-associated CpGs through Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation 450 K BeadChip; then, the pyrosequencing assay was used to further validate the association between the stable warfarin dose and alterations in the methylation of the screened CpGs. GenomeStudio Software and R were used to analyze the differentially methylated CpGs.The methylation levels of CpGs surrounding the xenobiotic response element (XRE) within the CYP1A1 promoter, differed significantly between the different dose groups (P < 0.05), and these CpGs presented a positive correlation (r> 0, P < 0.05) with an increase in the stable dose of warfarin. At the VKORC1 promoter, two CpGs methylation levels were significantly different between the differential dose groups (P < 0.05), and one CpG (Chr16: 31106793) presented a significant negative correlation (r <  0, P <  0.05) among different dose (low, medium, and high) groups.This is a novel report of the methylation levels of six CpGs surrounding the XRE within the CYP1A1 promoter and one differential CpG at the VKORC1 promoter associated with stable warfarin dosage; these methylation levels might be applied as molecular signatures for warfarin.©2021 He et al."
Yes,20210726,EWAS,34265559,"Exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, DNA methylation and heart rate variability among non-current smokers.",Environ Pollut,"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) exposure is associated with heart rate variability (HRV) reduction, a widely used marker of cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction. The role of DNA methylation in the relationship between PAHs exposure and decreased HRV is largely unknown. This study aims to explore epigenome-wide DNA methylation changes associated with PAHs exposure and further evaluate their associations with HRV alternations among non-current smokers. We measured 10 mono-hydroxylated PAHs (OH-PAHs) in urine and DNA methylation levels in blood leukocytes among participants from three panels of Chinese non-current smokers (152 in WHZH, 99 in SY, and 53 in COW). We conducted linear regression analyses between DNA methylation and OH-PAHs metabolites with adjustment for age, gender, body mass index, drinking, blood cell counts, and surrogate variables in each panel separately, and combined the results by using inverse-variance weighted fixed-effect meta-analysis to obtain estimates of effect size. The median value of total OH-PAHs ranged from 0.92 × 10-2in SY panel (62.6% men) to 13.82 × 10-2 μmol/mmol creatinine in COW panel (43.4% men). The results showed that methylation levels of cg18223625 (COL20A1) and cg07805771 (SLC16A1) were significantly or marginally significantly associated with urinary 2-hydroxynaphthalene [β(SE) = 0.431(0.074) and 0.354(0.068), FDR = 0.016 and 0.056, respectively], while methylation level of cg09235308 (PLEC1) was positively associated with urinary total OH-PAHs [β(SE) = 0.478(0.079), FDR = 0.004]. Hypermethylations of cg18223625, cg07805771, and cg09235308 were inversely associated with HRV indices among the WHZH and COW non-current smokers. However, we did not observe significant epigenome-wide associations for the other 9 urinary OH-PAHs. These findings provide new evidence that PAHs exposure is linked to differential DNA methylation, which may help better understand the influences of PAHs exposure on HRV alternations.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Yes,20210726,EWAS,34278703,Examining the association between adiposity and DNA methylation: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,Obes Rev,"Obesity is associated with widespread differential DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns, though there have been limited overlap in the obesity-associated cytosine-guanine nucleotide pair (CpG) sites that have been identified in the literature. We systematically searched four databases for studies published until January 2020. Eligible studies included cross-sectional, longitudinal, or intervention studies examining adiposity and genome-wide DNAm in non-pregnant adults aged 18-75 in all tissue types. Study design and results were extracted in the descriptive review. Blood-based DNAm results in body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) were meta-analyzed using weighted sum of Z-score meta-analysis. Of the 10,548 studies identified, 46 studies were included in the systematic review with 18 and nine studies included in the meta-analysis of BMI and WC, respectively. In the blood, 77 and four CpG sites were significant in three or more studies of BMI and WC, respectively. Using a genome-wide threshold for significance, 52 blood-based CpG sites were significantly associated with BMI. These sites have previously been associated with many obesity-related diseases including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, Crohn's disease, and depression. Our study shows that DNAm at 52 CpG sites represent potential mediators of obesity-associated chronic diseases and may be novel intervention or therapeutic targets to protect against obesity-associated chronic diseases.© 2021 World Obesity Federation."
Yes,20210726,EWAS,31811260,Epigenome-wide meta-analysis of blood DNA methylation and its association with subcortical volumes: findings from the ENIGMA Epigenetics Working Group,Mol Psychiatry,"DNA methylation, which is modulated by both genetic factors and environmental exposures, may offer a unique opportunity to discover novel biomarkers of disease-related brain phenotypes, even when measured in other tissues than brain, such as blood. A few studies of small sample sizes have revealed associations between blood DNA methylation and neuropsychopathology, however, large-scale epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) are needed to investigate the utility of DNA methylation profiling as a peripheral marker for the brain. Here, in an analysis of eleven international cohorts, totalling 3337 individuals, we report epigenome-wide meta-analyses of blood DNA methylation with volumes of the hippocampus, thalamus and nucleus accumbens (NAcc)-three subcortical regions selected for their associations with disease and heritability and volumetric variability. Analyses of individual CpGs revealed genome-wide significant associations with hippocampal volume at two loci. No significant associations were found for analyses of thalamus and nucleus accumbens volumes. Cluster-based analyses revealed additional differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with hippocampal volume. DNA methylation at these loci affected expression of proximal genes involved in learning and memory, stem cell maintenance and differentiation, fatty acid metabolism and type-2 diabetes. These DNA methylation marks, their interaction with genetic variants and their impact on gene expression offer new insights into the relationship between epigenetic variation and brain structure and may provide the basis for biomarker discovery in neurodegeneration and neuropsychiatric conditions."
