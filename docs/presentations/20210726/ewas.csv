We conducted a methylome-wide association study (MWAS) to identify differentially methylated sites (DMSs) of T2D and diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in a Korean population.We performed an MWAS in 232 participants with T2D and 197 non-diabetic controls with Illumina EPIC bead chip using peripheral blood leukocytes. T2D group was subdivided into 87 DKD cases and 80 non-DKD controls. Additional 819 individuals from two population-based cohorts were used to investigate the association of identified DMSs with quantitative metabolic phenotypes. Mendelian randomization (MR) approach was applied to evaluate the causal effect of metabolic phenotypes on identified DMSs.We identified eight DMSs (each at BMP8A, NBPF20, STX18, ZNF365, CPT1A, and TRIM37, and two at TXNIP) which were significantly associated with the risk of T2D (P < 9.0Ã—10 -8), including three that were previously known (DMSs in TXNIP and CPT1A). We also identified three DMSs (in COMMD1, TMOD1, and FHOD1) associated with DKD. With our limited sample size, we were not able to observe a significant overlap between DMSs of T2D and DKD. DMSs in TXNIP and CTP1A were associated with fasting glucose and HbA1c. In MR analysis, fasting glucose was causally associated with DMS in CPT1A.In an East Asian population, we identified eight DMSs, including five novel CpG loci, associated with T2D and three DMSs associated with DKD at methylome-wide statistical significance.Â© The Author(s) 2021.

Here, in an analysis of eleven international cohorts, totalling 3337 individuals, we report epigenome-wide meta-analyses of blood DNA methylation with volumes of the hippocampus, thalamus and nucleus accumbens (NAcc)-three subcortical regions selected for their associations with disease and heritability and volumetric variability. Analyses of individual CpGs revealed genome-wide significant associations with hippocampal volume at two loci. No significant associations were found for analyses of thalamus and nucleus accumbens volumes. Cluster-based analyses revealed additional differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with hippocampal volume. DNA methylation at these loci affected expression of proximal genes involved in learning and memory, stem cell maintenance and differentiation, fatty acid metabolism and type-2 diabetes.

34265559,polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,whole blood,314 Chinese non-smokers,3,,"Exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, DNA methylation and heart rate variability among non-current smokers.",Environ Pollut,"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) exposure is associated with heart rate variability (HRV) reduction, a widely used marker of cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction. The role of DNA methylation in the relationship between PAHs exposure and decreased HRV is largely unknown. This study aims to explore epigenome-wide DNA methylation changes associated with PAHs exposure and further evaluate their associations with HRV alternations among non-current smokers. We measured 10 mono-hydroxylated PAHs (OH-PAHs) in urine and DNA methylation levels in blood leukocytes among participants from three panels of Chinese non-current smokers (152 in WHZH, 99 in SY, and 53 in COW). We conducted linear regression analyses between DNA methylation and OH-PAHs metabolites with adjustment for age, gender, body mass index, drinking, blood cell counts, and surrogate variables in each panel separately, and combined the results by using inverse-variance weighted fixed-effect meta-analysis to obtain estimates of effect size. The median value of total OH-PAHs ranged from 0.92Â Ã—Â 10-2in SY panel (62.6% men) to 13.82Â Ã—Â 10-2Â Î¼mol/mmol creatinine in COW panel (43.4% men). The results showed that methylation levels of cg18223625 (COL20A1) and cg07805771 (SLC16A1) were significantly or marginally significantly associated with urinary 2-hydroxynaphthalene [Î²(SE)Â =Â 0.431(0.074) and 0.354(0.068), FDRÂ =Â 0.016 and 0.056, respectively], while methylation level of cg09235308 (PLEC1) was positively associated with urinary total OH-PAHs [Î²(SE)Â =Â 0.478(0.079), FDRÂ =Â 0.004]. Hypermethylations of cg18223625, cg07805771, and cg09235308 were inversely associated with HRV indices among the WHZH and COW non-current smokers. However, we did not observe significant epigenome-wide associations for the other 9 urinary OH-PAHs. These findings provide new evidence that PAHs exposure is linked to differential DNA methylation, which may help better understand the influences of PAHs exposure on HRV alternations.Copyright Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

34170065,prosocial behavior,cord blood,2100 infants (PACE meta-analysis),null ,,Neonatal DNA methylation and childhood low prosocial behavior: An epigenome-wide association meta-analysis.,Am J Med Genet B Neuropsychiatr Genet,"Low prosocial behavior in childhood has been consistently linked to later psychopathology, with evidence supporting the influence of both genetic and environmental factors on its development. Although neonatal DNA methylation (DNAm) has been found to prospectively associate with a range of psychological traits in childhood, its potential role in prosocial development has yet to be investigated. This study investigated prospective associations between cord blood DNAm at birth and low prosocial behavior within and across four longitudinal birth cohorts from the Pregnancy And Childhood Epigenetics (PACE) Consortium. We examined (a) developmental trajectories of ""chronic-low"" versus ""typical"" prosocial behavior across childhood in a case-control design (NÂ =Â 2,095), and (b) continuous ""low prosocial"" scores at comparable cross-cohort time-points (NÂ =Â 2,121). Meta-analyses were performed to examine differentially methylated positions and regions. At the cohort-specific level, three CpGs were found to associate with chronic low prosocial behavior; however, none of these associations was replicated in another cohort. Meta-analysis revealed no epigenome-wide significant CpGs or regions. Overall, we found no evidence for associations between DNAm patterns at birth and low prosocial behavior across childhood. Findings highlight the importance of employing multi-cohort approaches to replicate epigenetic associations and reduce the risk of false positive discoveries.Â© 2021 The Authors.

34174944,GDM,cord blood,23 cases and 252 controls,1410 sites (cell-type specific using CellDMC),4 CD8 T cell and 6 monocyte associations associated with BMI at 3,Detecting cord blood cell type-specific epigenetic associations with gestational diabetes mellitus and early childhood growth.,Clin Epigenetics,"Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) have provided opportunities to understand the role of epigenetic mechanisms in development and pathophysiology of many chronic diseases. However, an important limitation of conventional EWAS is that profiles of epigenetic variability are often obtained in samples of mixed cell types. Here, we aim to assess whether changes in cord blood DNA methylation (DNAm) associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) exposure and early childhood growth markers occur in a cell type-specific manner.We analyzed 275 cord blood samples collected at delivery from a prospective pre-birth cohort with genome-wide DNAm profiled by the Illumina MethylationEPIC array. We estimated proportions of seven common cell types in each sample using a cord blood-specific DNAm reference panel. Leveraging a recently developed approach named CellDMC, we performed cell type-specific EWAS to identify CpG loci significantly associated with GDM, or 3-year-old body mass index (BMI) z-score. A total of 1410 CpG loci displayed significant cell type-specific differences in methylation level between 23 GDM cases and 252 controls with a false discovery rateâ€‰<â€‰0.05. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis indicated that LDL transportation emerged from CpG specifically identified from B-cells DNAm analyses and the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway emerged from CpG specifically identified from natural killer cells DNAm analyses. In addition, we identified four and six loci associated with 3-year-old BMI z-score that were specific to CD8+â€‰T-cells and monocytes, respectively. By performing genome-wide permutation tests, we validated that most of our detected signals had low false positive rates.Compared to conventional EWAS adjusting for the effects of cell type heterogeneity, the proposed approach based on cell type-specific EWAS could provide additional biologically meaningful associations between CpG methylation, prenatal maternal GDM or 3-year-old BMI. With careful validation, these findings may provide new insights into the pathogenesis, programming, and consequences of related childhood metabolic dysregulation. Therefore, we propose that cell type-specific analyses are worth cautious explorations."
