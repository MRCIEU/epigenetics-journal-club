36908043,Pruning and thresholding approach for methylation risk scores in multi-ancestry populations.,Epigenetics,"Recent efforts have focused on developing methylation risk scores (MRS), a weighted sum of the individual's DNA methylation (DNAm) values of pre-selected CpG sites. Most of the current MRS approaches that utilize Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) summary statistics only include genome-wide significant CpG sites and do not consider co-methylation. New methods that relax the p-value threshold to include more CpG sites and account for the inter-correlation of DNAm might improve the predictive performance of MRS. We paired informed co-methylation pruning with P-value thresholding to generate pruning and thresholding (P+T) MRS and evaluated its performance among multi-ancestry populations. Through simulation studies and real data analyses, we demonstrated that pruning provides an improvement over simple thresholding methods for prediction of phenotypes. We demonstrated that European-derived summary statistics can be used to develop P+T MRS among other populations such as African populations. However, the prediction accuracy of P+T MRS may differ across multi-ancestry population due to environmental/cultural/social differences."
36907174,Chromosome 18 loss of heterozygosity in small intestinal neuroendocrine tumours: Multi-omic and tumour composition analyses.,Neuroendocrinology,"Small intestinal neuroendocrine tumours (siNETs) are rare neoplasms which present with low mutational burden and can be subtyped based on copy number variation (CNV). Currently, siNETs can be molecularly classified as having chromosome 18 loss of heterozygosity (18LOH), multiple CNVs (MultiCNV), or no CNVs. 18LOH tumours have better progression free survival when compared to MultiCNV and NoCNV tumours, however the mechanism underlying this is unknown, and clinical practice does not currently consider CNV status.Here, we use genome-wide tumour DNA methylation (n=54) and gene expression (n=20 matched to DNA methylation) to better understand how gene regulation varies by 18LOH status. We then use multiple cell deconvolution methods to analyse how cell composition varies between 18LOH status, and determine potential associations with progression free survival.We identified 27,464 differentially methylated CpG sites and 12 differentially expressed genes between 18LOH and non-18LOH (MultiCNV + NoCNV) siNETs. Although few differentially expressed genes were identified, these genes were highly enriched with the differentially methylated CpG sites compared to the rest of the genome. We identified differences in tumour micro-environment between 18LOH and non-18LOH tumours, including CD14+ infiltration in a subset of non-18LOH tumours which had the poorest clinical outcomes.We identify a small number of genes which appear to be linked to the 18LOH status of siNETs, and find evidence of potential epigenetic dysregulation of these genes. We also find a potential prognostic marker for worse progression free outcomes in the form of higher CD14 infiltration in non-18LOH siNETs.S. Karger AG, Basel."
36899042,Epigenome-wide meta-analysis of prenatal maternal stressful life events and newborn DNA methylation.,Mol Psychiatry,"Prenatal maternal stressful life events are associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in offspring. Biological mechanisms underlying these associations are largely unknown, but DNA methylation likely plays a role. This meta-analysis included twelve non-overlapping cohorts from ten independent longitudinal studies (N = 5,496) within the international Pregnancy and Childhood Epigenetics consortium to examine maternal stressful life events during pregnancy and DNA methylation in cord blood. Children whose mothers reported higher levels of cumulative maternal stressful life events during pregnancy exhibited differential methylation of cg26579032 in ALKBH3. Stressor-specific domains of conflict with family/friends, abuse (physical, sexual, and emotional), and death of a close friend/relative were also associated with differential methylation of CpGs in APTX, MyD88, and both UHRF1 and SDCCAG8, respectively; these genes are implicated in neurodegeneration, immune and cellular functions, regulation of global methylation levels, metabolism, and schizophrenia risk. Thus, differences in DNA methylation at these loci may provide novel insights into potential mechanisms of neurodevelopment in offspring.© 2023.

36891970,Exploiting the mediating role of the metabolome to unravel transcript-to-phenotype associations.,Elife,"Despite the success of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in identifying genetic variants associated with complex traits, understanding the mechanisms behind these statistical associations remains challenging. Several methods that integrate methylation, gene expression, and protein quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with GWAS data to determine their causal role in the path from genotype to phenotype have been proposed. Here, we developed and applied a multi-omics Mendelian randomization (MR) framework to study how metabolites mediate the effect of gene expression on complex traits. We identified 216 transcript-metabolite-trait causal triplets involving 26 medically relevant phenotypes. Among these associations, 58% were missed by classical transcriptome-wide MR, which only uses gene expression and GWAS data. This allowed the identification of biologically relevant pathways, such as betweenANKHand calcium levels mediated by citrate levels andSLC6A12and serum creatinine through modulation of the levels of the renal osmolyte betaine. We show that the signals missed by transcriptome-wide MR are found, thanks to the increase in power conferred by integrating multiple omics layer. Simulation analyses show that with larger molecular QTL studies and in case of mediated effects, our multi-omics MR framework outperforms classical MR approaches designed to detect causal relationships between single molecular traits and complex phenotypes.© 2023, Auwerx et al."
36911092,Characteristics of circulating small noncoding RNAs in plasma and serum during human aging.,Aging Med (Milton),"Aging is a complicated process that triggers age-related disease susceptibility through intercellular communication in the microenvironment. While the classic secretome of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) including soluble factors, growth factors, and extracellular matrix remodeling enzymes are known to impact tissue homeostasis during the aging process, the effects of novel SASP components, extracellular small noncoding RNAs (sncRNAs), on human aging are not well established.Here, by utilizing 446 small RNA-seq samples from plasma and serum of healthy donors found in the Extracellular RNA (exRNA) Atlas data repository, we correlated linear and nonlinear features between circulating sncRNAs expression and age by the maximal information coefficient (MIC) relationship determination. Age predictors were generated by ensemble machine learning methods (Adaptive Boosting, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest) and core age-related sncRNAs were determined through weighted coefficients in machine learning models. Functional investigation was performed via target prediction of age-related miRNAs.We observed the number of highly expressed transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) showed positive and negative associations with age respectively. Two-variable (sncRNA expression and individual age) relationships were detected by MIC and sncRNAs-based age predictors were established, resulting in a forecast performance where allR2values were greater than 0.96 and root-mean-square errors (RMSE) were less than 3.7 years in three ensemble machine learning methods. Furthermore, important age-related sncRNAs were identified based on modeling and the biological pathways of age-related miRNAs were characterized by their predicted targets, including multiple pathways in intercellular communication, cancer and immune regulation.In summary, this study provides valuable insights into circulating sncRNAs expression dynamics during human aging and may lead to advanced understanding of age-related sncRNAs functions with further elucidation.© 2023 The Authors.

36802439,Epigenetic-based age acceleration in a representative sample of older Americans: Associations with aging-related morbidity and mortality.,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Biomarkers developed from DNA methylation (DNAm) data are of growing interest as predictors of health outcomes and mortality in older populations. However, it is unknown how epigenetic aging fits within the context of known socioeconomic and behavioral associations with aging-related health outcomes in a large, population-based, and diverse sample. This study uses data from a representative, panel study of US older adults to examine the relationship between DNAm-based age acceleration measures in the prediction of cross-sectional and longitudinal health outcomes and mortality. We examine whether recent improvements to these scores, using principal component (PC)-based measures designed to remove some of the technical noise and unreliability in measurement, improve the predictive capability of these measures. We also examine how well DNAm-based measures perform against well-known predictors of health outcomes such as demographics, SES, and health behaviors. In our sample, age acceleration calculated using ""second and third generation clocks,"" PhenoAge, GrimAge, and DunedinPACE, is consistently a significant predictor of health outcomes including cross-sectional cognitive dysfunction, functional limitations and chronic conditions assessed 2 y after DNAm measurement, and 4-y mortality. PC-based epigenetic age acceleration measures do not significantly change the relationship of DNAm-based age acceleration measures to health outcomes or mortality compared to earlier versions of these measures. While the usefulness of DNAm-based age acceleration as a predictor of later life health outcomes is quite clear, other factors such as demographics, SES, mental health, and health behaviors remain equally, if not more robust, predictors of later life outcomes."
36824751,Genetic mechanisms of 184 neuro-related proteins in human plasma.,medRxiv,"Understanding the genetic basis of neuro-related proteins is essential for dissecting the disease etiology of neuropsychiatric disorders and other complex traits and diseases. Here, the SCALLOP Consortium conducted a genome-wide association meta-analysis of over 12,500 individuals for 184 neuro-related proteins in human plasma. The analysis identified 117 cis-regulatory protein quantitative trait loci (cis-pQTL) and 166 trans-pQTL. The mapped pQTL capture on average 50% of each protein's heritability. Mendelian randomization analyses revealed multiple proteins showing potential causal effects on neuro-related traits as well as complex diseases such as hypertension, high cholesterol, immune-related disorders, and psychiatric disorders. Integrating with established drug information, we validated 13 combinations of protein targets and diseases or side effects with available drugs, while suggesting hundreds of re-purposing and new therapeutic targets for diseases and comorbidities. This consortium effort provides a large-scale proteogenomic resource for biomedical research."
36778249,Somatic nuclear mitochondrial DNA insertions are prevalent in the human brain and accumulate in aging fibroblasts.,bioRxiv,"The transfer of mitochondrial DNA into the nuclear genomes of eukaryotes (Numts) has been linked to lifespan in some non-human species. We investigated their association with human aging in two ways. First, we quantified Numts in 1,187 post-mortem brain and blood samples. Human brains exhibited a 5.5-fold enrichment of somatic Numt insertions in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex compared to the cerebellum, suggesting that they arose spontaneously during development or with aging. Moreover, more brain Numts was linked to earlier mortality. The brains of individuals with no cognitive impairment who died at younger ages carried approximately 2 more Numts per decade of life lost than those who lived longer. Second, we tested the dynamic transfer of Numts in a repeated-measures WGS study in a human fibroblast model that recapitulates several molecular features of human aging. These longitudinal experiments revealed a gradual accumulation of one Numt every ~9 days, independent of large-scale genomic instability. Targeted genetic and pharmacological perturbations of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation did not affect numtogenesis, whereas chronic glucocorticoid stress increased the Numts transfer rate by 39.8%. Combined, our data document spontaneous numtogenesis in aging human cells and demonstrate an association between brain cortical somatic Numts and human lifespan."
36906598,A systematic evaluation of normalization methods and probe replicability using infinium EPIC methylation data.,Clin Epigenetics,"The Infinium EPIC array measures the methylation status of > 850,000 CpG sites. The EPIC BeadChip uses a two-array design: Infinium Type I and Type II probes. These probe types exhibit different technical characteristics which may confound analyses. Numerous normalization and pre-processing methods have been developed to reduce probe type bias as well as other issues such as background and dye bias.This study evaluates the performance of various normalization methods using 16 replicated samples and three metrics: absolute beta-value difference, overlap of non-replicated CpGs between replicate pairs, and effect on beta-value distributions. Additionally, we carried out Pearson's correlation and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) analyses using both raw and SeSAMe 2 normalized data.The method we define as SeSAMe 2, which consists of the application of the regular SeSAMe pipeline with an additional round of QC, pOOBAH masking, was found to be the best performing normalization method, while quantile-based methods were found to be the worst performing methods. Whole-array Pearson's correlations were found to be high. However, in agreement with previous studies, a substantial proportion of the probes on the EPIC array showed poor reproducibility (ICC < 0.50). The majority of poor performing probes have beta values close to either 0 or 1, and relatively low standard deviations. These results suggest that probe reliability is largely the result of limited biological variation rather than technical measurement variation. Importantly, normalizing the data with SeSAMe 2 dramatically improved ICC estimates, with the proportion of probes with ICC values > 0.50 increasing from 45.18% (raw data) to 61.35% (SeSAMe 2).© 2023.

36890172,Pre- and peri-natal hurricane exposure alters DNA methylation patterns in children.,Sci Rep,"Hurricane Maria was the worst recorded natural disaster to affect Puerto Rico. Increased stress in pregnant women during and in the aftermath of the hurricane may have induced epigenetic changes in their infants, which could affect gene expression. Stage of gestation at the time of the event was associated with significant differences in DNA methylation in the infants, especially those who were at around 20-25 weeks of gestation when the hurricane struck. Significant differences in DNA methylation were also associated with maternal mental status assessed after the hurricane, and with property damage. Hurricane Maria could have long lasting consequences to children who were exposed to this disaster during pregnancy.© 2023. The Author(s)."
36873953,Circulatory proteins relate cardiovascular disease to cognitive performance: A mendelian randomisation study.,Front Genet,"Background and objectives:Mechanistic research suggests synergistic effects of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and dementia pathologies on cognitive decline. Interventions targeting proteins relevant to shared mechanisms underlying CVD and dementia could also be used for the prevention of cognitive impairment.Methods:We applied Mendelian randomisation (MR) and colocalization analysis to investigate the causal relationships of 90 CVD-related proteins measured by the Olink CVD I panel with cognitive traits. Genetic instruments for circulatory protein concentrations were obtained using a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) from the SCALLOP consortium (N = 17,747) based on three sets of criteria: 1) protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL); 2)cis-pQTL (pQTL within ±500 kb from the coding gene); and 3) brain-specificcis-expression QTL (cis-eQTL) which accounts for coding gene expression based on GTEx8. Genetic associations of cognitive performance were obtained from GWAS for either: 1) general cognitive function constructed using Principal Component Analysis (N = 300,486); or, 2)gFactor constructed using genomic structural equation modelling (N = 11,263-331,679). Findings for candidate causal proteins were replicated using a separate protein GWAS in Icelanders (N = 35,559).Results:A higher concentration of genetically predicted circulatory myeloperoxidase (MPO) was nominally associated with better cognitive performance (p< 0.05) using different selection criteria for genetic instruments. Particularly, brain-specificcis-eQTL predicted MPO, which accounts for protein-coding gene expression in brain tissues, was associated with general cognitive function (βWald= 0.22, PWald= 2.4 × 10-4). The posterior probability for colocalization (PP.H4) of MPO pQTL with thegFactor was 0.577. Findings for MPO were replicated using the Icelandic GWAS. Although we did not find evidence for colocalization, we found that higher genetically predicted concentrations of cathepsin D and CD40 were associated with better cognitive performance and a higher genetically predicted concentration of CSF-1 was associated with poorer cognitive performance.Conclusion:We conclude that these proteins are involved in shared pathways between CVD and those for cognitive reserve or affecting cognitive decline, suggesting therapeutic targets able to reduce genetic risks conferred by cardiovascular disease.Copyright © 2023 Huang, Gill, Zuber, Matthews, Elliott, Tzoulaki and Dehghan."
36791098,The HP1Î± protein is mandatory to repress the circadian clock and its output genes during the 12 h period of transcriptional repression.,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"The transcriptional repressions driven by the circadian core clock repressors RevErbα, E4BP4, and CRY1/PER1 involve feedback loops which are mandatory for generating the circadian rhythms. These repressors are known to bind to cognate DNA binding sites, but how their circadian bindings trigger the cascade of events leading to these repressions remain to be elucidated. Through molecular and genetic analyses, we now demonstrate that the chromatin protein HP1α plays a key role in these transcriptional repressions of both the circadian clock (CC) genes and their cognate output genes (CCGs). We show that these CC repressors recruit the HP1α protein downstream from a repressive cascade, and that this recruitment is mandatory for the maintenance of both the CC integrity and the expression of the circadian genes. We further show that the presence of HP1α is critical for both the repressor-induced chromatin compaction and the generation of ""transcriptionally repressed biomolecular hydrophobic condensates"" and demonstrates that HP1α is mandatory within the CC output genes for both the recruitment of DNA methylating enzymes on the intronic deoxyCpG islands and their subsequent methylation."
