"36918927","Conservation and divergence of canonical and non-canonical imprinting in murids.","Genome Biol","Genomic imprinting affects gene expression in a parent-of-origin manner and has a profound impact on complex traits including growth and behavior. While the rat is widely used to model human pathophysiology, few imprinted genes have been identified in this murid. To systematically identify imprinted genes and genomic imprints in the rat, we use low input methods for genome-wide analyses of gene expression and DNA methylation to profile embryonic and extraembryonic tissues at allele-specific resolution.We identify 14 and 26 imprinted genes in these tissues, respectively, with 10 of these genes imprinted in both tissues. Comparative analyses with mouse reveal that orthologous imprinted gene expression and associated canonical DNA methylation imprints are conserved in the embryo proper of the Muridae family. However, only 3 paternally expressed imprinted genes are conserved in the extraembryonic tissue of murids, all of which are associated with non-canonical H3K27me3 imprints. The discovery of 8 novel non-canonical imprinted genes unique to the rat is consistent with more rapid evolution of extraembryonic imprinting. Meta-analysis of novel imprinted genes reveals multiple mechanisms by which species-specific imprinted expression may be established, including H3K27me3 deposition in the oocyte, the appearance of ZFP57 binding motifs, and the insertion of endogenous retroviral promoters.In summary, we provide an expanded list of imprinted loci in the rat, reveal the extent of conservation of imprinted gene expression, and identify potential mechanisms responsible for the evolution of species-specific imprinting.© 2023.

"36916248","Optimising biomarkers for accurate ependymoma diagnosis, prognostication and stratification within International Clinical Trials: A BIOMECA study.","Neuro Oncol","Accurate identification of brain tumour molecular subgroups is increasingly important. We aimed to establish the most accurate and reproducible ependymoma subgroup biomarker detection techniques, across 147 cases from International Society of Pediatric Oncology (SIOP) Ependymoma II trial participants, enrolled in the pan-European ""Biomarkers of Ependymoma in Children and Adolescents (BIOMECA)"" study.Across six European BIOMECA laboratories we evaluated epigenetic profiling (DNA methylation array); immunohistochemistry (IHC) for nuclear p65-RELA, H3K27me3, and Tenascin-C; copy number analysis via FISH and MLPA (1q, CDKN2A), and MIP and DNA methylation array (genome-wide copy number evaluation); analysis of ZFTA- and YAP1-fusions by RT-PCR and sequencing, Nanostring and break-apart FISH.DNA Methylation profiling classified 65.3% (n=96/147) of cases as EPN-PFA and 15% (n=22/147) as ST-ZFTA fusion-positive. Immunohistochemical loss of H3K27me3 was a reproducible and accurate surrogate marker for EPN-PFA (sensitivity 99-100% across three centres). IHC for p65-RELA, FISH, and RNA-based analyses effectively identified ZFTA- and YAP1- fused supratentorial ependymomas. Detection of 1q gain using FISH exhibited only 57% inter-centre concordance and low sensitivity and specificity whilst MIP, MLPA and DNA methylation-based approaches demonstrated greater accuracy.We confirm, in a prospective trial cohort, that H3K27me3 immunohistochemistry is a robust EPN-PFA biomarker. Tenascin-C should be abandoned as a PFA marker. DNA methylation and MIP arrays are effective tools for copy number analysis of 1q gain, 6q and CDKN2A loss whilst FISH is inadequate. Fusion detection was successful, but rare novel fusions need more extensive technologies. Finally, we propose test sets to guide future diagnostic approaches.© The Author(s) 2023.

"36915112","A variability in response of osteoclasts to zoledronic acid is mediated by smoking-associated modification in the DNA methylome.","Clin Epigenetics","Clinical trials have shown zoledronic acid as a potent bisphosphonate in preventing bone loss, but with varying potency between patients. Human osteoclasts ex vivo reportedly displayed a variable sensitivity to zoledronic acid > 200-fold, determined by the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50), with cigarette smoking as one of the reported contributors to this variation. To reveal the molecular basis of the smoking-mediated variation on treatment sensitivity, we performed a DNA methylome profiling on whole blood cells from 34 healthy female blood donors. Multiple regression models were fitted to associate DNA methylation with ex vivo determined IC50 values, smoking, and their interaction adjusting for age and cell compositions.We identified 59 CpGs displaying genome-wide significance (p < 1e-08) with a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 for the smoking-dependent association with IC50. Among them, 3 CpGs have p < 1e-08 and FDR < 2e-03. By comparing with genome-wide association studies, 15 significant CpGs were locally enriched (within < 50,000 bp) by SNPs associated with bone and body size measures. Furthermore, through a replication analysis using data from a published multi-omics association study on bone mineral density (BMD), we could validate that 29 out of the 59 CpGs were in close vicinity of genomic sites significantly associated with BMD. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis on genes linked to the 59 CpGs displaying smoking-dependent association with IC50, detected 18 significant GO terms including cation:cation antiporter activity, extracellular matrix conferring tensile strength, ligand-gated ion channel activity, etc. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that smoking mediates individual sensitivity to zoledronic acid treatment through epigenetic regulation. Our novel findings could have important clinical implications since DNA methylation analysis may enable personalized zoledronic acid treatment.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36915063","Genome-wide characterization and expression analysis of MYB transcription factors in Chrysanthemum nankingense.","BMC Plant Biol","Chrysanthemum is a popular ornamental plant worldwide. MYB (v-myb avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog) transcription factors play an important role in everything from stress resistance to plant growth and development. However, the MYB family of chrysanthemums has not been the subject of a detailed bioinformatics and expression investigation.In this study, we examined 324 CnMYB transcription factors from Chrysanthemum nankingense genome data, which contained 122 Cn1R-MYB, 183 CnR2R3-MYB, 12 Cn3R-MYB, 2 Cn4R-MYB, and 5 atypical CnMYB. The protein motifs and classification of CnMYB transcription factors were analyzed. Among them, motifs 1, 2, 3, and 4 were found to encode the MYB DNA-binding domain in R2R3-MYB proteins, while in other-MYB proteins, the motifs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 encode the MYB DNA-binding domain. Among all CnMYBs, 44 genes were selected due to the presence of CpG islands, while methylation is detected in three genes, including CnMYB9, CnMYB152, and CnMYB219. We analyzed the expression levels of each CnMYB gene in ray floret, disc floret, flower bud, leaf, stem, and root tissues. Based on phylogenetic analysis and gene expression analysis, three genes appeared likely to control cellulose and lignin synthesis in stem tissue, and 16 genes appeared likely to regulate flowering time, anther, pollen development, and flower color. Fifty-one candidate genes that may be involved in stress response were identified through phylogenetic, stress-responseve motif of promoter, and qRT-PCR analyses. According to genes expression levels under stress conditions, six CnMYB genes (CnMYB9, CnMYB172, CnMYB186, CnMYB199, CnMYB219, and CnMYB152) were identified as key stress-responsive genes.This research provides useful information for further functional analysis of the CnMYB gene family in chrysanthemums, as well as offers candidate genes for further study of cellulose and lignin synthesis, flowering traits, salt and drought stress mechanism.© 2023.

"36914876","The genetic basis of endometriosis and comorbidity with other pain and inflammatory conditions.","Nat Genet","Endometriosis is a common condition associated with debilitating pelvic pain and infertility. A genome-wide association study meta-analysis, including 60,674 cases and 701,926 controls of European and East Asian descent, identified 42 genome-wide significant loci comprising 49 distinct association signals. Effect sizes were largest for stage 3/4 disease, driven by ovarian endometriosis. Identified signals explained up to 5.01% of disease variance and regulated expression or methylation of genes in endometrium and blood, many of which were associated with pain perception/maintenance (SRP14/BMF, GDAP1, MLLT10, BSN and NGF). We observed significant genetic correlations between endometriosis and 11 pain conditions, including migraine, back and multisite chronic pain (MCP), as well as inflammatory conditions, including asthma and osteoarthritis. Multitrait genetic analyses identified substantial sharing of variants associated with endometriosis and MCP/migraine. Targeted investigations of genetically regulated mechanisms shared between endometriosis and other pain conditions are needed to aid the development of new treatments and facilitate early symptomatic intervention.© 2023.

"36911799","Transcriptional and Epigenetic Regulation of Context-Dependent Plasticity in T-Helper Lineages.","Immune Netw","Th cell lineage determination and functional specialization are tightly linked to the activation of lineage-determining transcription factors (TFs) that bindcis-regulatory elements. These lineage-determining TFs act in concert with multiple layers of transcriptional regulators to alter the epigenetic landscape, including DNA methylation, histone modification and three-dimensional chromosome architecture, in order to facilitate the specific Th gene expression programs that allow for phenotypic diversification. Accumulating evidence indicates that Th cell differentiation is not as rigid as classically held; rather, extensive phenotypic plasticity is an inherent feature of T cell lineages. Recent studies have begun to uncover the epigenetic programs that mechanistically govern T cell subset specification and immunological memory. Advances in next generation sequencing technologies have allowed global transcriptomic and epigenomic interrogation of CD4+ Th cells that extends previous findings focusing on individual loci. In this review, we provide an overview of recent genome-wide insights into the transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of CD4+ T cell-mediated adaptive immunity and discuss the implications for disease as well as immunotherapies.Copyright © 2023.

"36911738","Whole genome methylation combined with RNA-seq reveals the protective effects of Gualou-Xiebai herb pair in foam cells through DNA methylation mediated PI3K-AKT signaling pathway.","Front Immunol","DNA methylation, including aberrant hypomethylation and hypermethylation, plays a significant role in atherosclerosis (AS); therefore, targeting the unbalanced methylation in AS is a potential treatment strategy. Gualou-xiebai herb pair (GXHP), a classic herb combination, have been used for the treatment of atherosclerotic-associated diseases in traditional Chinese medicine. However, the effects and underlying mechanism of GXHP on AS remain nebulous. In this study, the CCK-8 method was applied to determine the non-toxic treatment concentrations for GXHP. The formation of foam cells played a critical role in AS, so the foam cells model was established after RAW264.7 cells were treated with ox-LDL. The contents of total cholesterol (TC) and free cholesterol (FC) were determined by Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to check the expressions of inflammatory factors including IL-1β, TNF-α, and VCAM-1. Methyl-capture sequencing (MC-seq) and RNA-seq were applied to observe the changes in genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression, respectively. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were performed to analyze differentially methylated genes (DMGs) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The targeted signaling pathway was selected and verified using western blotting (WB). The results showed that the lipids and inflammatory factors in foam cells significantly increased. GXHP significantly reduced the expression of TC, FC, and inflammatory factors. MC-seq and RNA-seq showed that GXHP not only corrected the aberrant DNA hypermethylation, but also DNA hypomethylation, thus restored the aberrant DEGs in foam cells induced by ox-LDL. GXHP treatment may target the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. GXHP reduced the protein levels of phosphorylated(p)-PI3K and p-AKT in foam cells. Our data suggest that treatment with GXHP showed protective effects against AS through the inhibition of DNA methylation mediated PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, suggesting GXHP as a novel methylation-based agent.Copyright © 2023 Jia, Mei, Zhang, Wang, Wang, Wang, Xu and Zhou."
"36908043","Pruning and thresholding approach for methylation risk scores in multi-ancestry populations.","Epigenetics","Recent efforts have focused on developing methylation risk scores (MRS), a weighted sum of the individual's DNA methylation (DNAm) values of pre-selected CpG sites. Most of the current MRS approaches that utilize Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) summary statistics only include genome-wide significant CpG sites and do not consider co-methylation. New methods that relax the p-value threshold to include more CpG sites and account for the inter-correlation of DNAm might improve the predictive performance of MRS. We paired informed co-methylation pruning with P-value thresholding to generate pruning and thresholding (P+T) MRS and evaluated its performance among multi-ancestry populations. Through simulation studies and real data analyses, we demonstrated that pruning provides an improvement over simple thresholding methods for prediction of phenotypes. We demonstrated that European-derived summary statistics can be used to develop P+T MRS among other populations such as African populations. However, the prediction accuracy of P+T MRS may differ across multi-ancestry population due to environmental/cultural/social differences."
"36907174","Chromosome 18 loss of heterozygosity in small intestinal neuroendocrine tumours: Multi-omic and tumour composition analyses.","Neuroendocrinology","Small intestinal neuroendocrine tumours (siNETs) are rare neoplasms which present with low mutational burden and can be subtyped based on copy number variation (CNV). Currently, siNETs can be molecularly classified as having chromosome 18 loss of heterozygosity (18LOH), multiple CNVs (MultiCNV), or no CNVs. 18LOH tumours have better progression free survival when compared to MultiCNV and NoCNV tumours, however the mechanism underlying this is unknown, and clinical practice does not currently consider CNV status.Here, we use genome-wide tumour DNA methylation (n=54) and gene expression (n=20 matched to DNA methylation) to better understand how gene regulation varies by 18LOH status. We then use multiple cell deconvolution methods to analyse how cell composition varies between 18LOH status, and determine potential associations with progression free survival.We identified 27,464 differentially methylated CpG sites and 12 differentially expressed genes between 18LOH and non-18LOH (MultiCNV + NoCNV) siNETs. Although few differentially expressed genes were identified, these genes were highly enriched with the differentially methylated CpG sites compared to the rest of the genome. We identified differences in tumour micro-environment between 18LOH and non-18LOH tumours, including CD14+ infiltration in a subset of non-18LOH tumours which had the poorest clinical outcomes.We identify a small number of genes which appear to be linked to the 18LOH status of siNETs, and find evidence of potential epigenetic dysregulation of these genes. We also find a potential prognostic marker for worse progression free outcomes in the form of higher CD14 infiltration in non-18LOH siNETs.S. Karger AG, Basel."
"36902194","Characterization of Genes That Exhibit Genotype-Dependent Allele-Specific Expression and Its Implications for the Development of Maize Kernel.","Int J Mol Sci","Heterosis or hybrid vigor refers to the superior phenotypic traits of hybrids relative to their parental inbred lines. An imbalance between the expression levels of two parental alleles in the F1 hybrid has been suggested as a mechanism of heterosis. Here, based on genome-wide allele-specific expression analysis using RNA sequencing technology, 1689 genes exhibiting genotype-dependent allele-specific expression (genotype-dependent ASEGs) were identified in the embryos, and 1390 genotype-dependent ASEGs in the endosperm, of three maize F1 hybrids. Of these ASEGs, most were consistent in different tissues from one hybrid cross, but nearly 50% showed allele-specific expression from some genotypes but not others. These genotype-dependent ASEGs were mostly enriched in metabolic pathways of substances and energy, including the tricarboxylic acid cycle, aerobic respiration, and energy derivation by oxidation of organic compounds and ADP binding. Mutation and overexpression of one ASEG affected kernel size, which indicates that these genotype-dependent ASEGs may make important contributions to kernel development. Finally, the allele-specific methylation pattern on genotype-dependent ASEGs indicated that DNA methylation plays a potential role in the regulation of allelic expression for some ASEGs. In this study, a detailed analysis of genotype-dependent ASEGs in the embryo and endosperm of three different maize F1 hybrids will provide an index of genes for future research on the genetic and molecular mechanism of heterosis."
"36900421","DNA Methylation and Prospects for Predicting the Therapeutic Effect of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Triple-Negative and Luminal B Breast Cancer.","Cancers (Basel)","Despite advances in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer (BC), the main cause of deaths is resistance to existing therapies. An approach to improve the effectiveness of therapy in patients with aggressive BC subtypes is neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). Yet, the response to NACT for aggressive subtypes is less than 65% according to large clinical trials. An obvious fact is the lack of biomarkers predicting the therapeutic effect of NACT. In a search for epigenetic markers, we performed genome-wide differential methylation screening by XmaI-RRBS in cohorts of NACT responders and nonresponders, for triple-negative (TN) and luminal B tumors. The predictive potential of the most discriminative loci was further assessed in independent cohorts by methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme quantitative PCR (MSRE-qPCR), a promising method for the implementation of DNA methylation markers in diagnostic laboratories. The selected most informative individual markers were combined into panels demonstrating cvAUC = 0.83 (TMEM132DandMYO15Bmarkers panel) for TN tumors and cvAUC = 0.76 (TTC34,LTBRandCLEC14A) for luminal B tumors. The combination of methylation markers with clinical features that correlate with NACT effect (clinical stage for TN and lymph node status for luminal B tumors) produces better classifiers, with cvAUC = 0.87 for TN tumors and cvAUC = 0.83 for luminal B tumors. Thus, clinical characteristics predictive of NACT response are independently additive to the epigenetic classifier and in combination improve prediction."
"36899042","Epigenome-wide meta-analysis of prenatal maternal stressful life events and newborn DNA methylation.","Mol Psychiatry","Prenatal maternal stressful life events are associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in offspring. Biological mechanisms underlying these associations are largely unknown, but DNA methylation likely plays a role. This meta-analysis included twelve non-overlapping cohorts from ten independent longitudinal studies (N = 5,496) within the international Pregnancy and Childhood Epigenetics consortium to examine maternal stressful life events during pregnancy and DNA methylation in cord blood. Children whose mothers reported higher levels of cumulative maternal stressful life events during pregnancy exhibited differential methylation of cg26579032 in ALKBH3. Stressor-specific domains of conflict with family/friends, abuse (physical, sexual, and emotional), and death of a close friend/relative were also associated with differential methylation of CpGs in APTX, MyD88, and both UHRF1 and SDCCAG8, respectively; these genes are implicated in neurodegeneration, immune and cellular functions, regulation of global methylation levels, metabolism, and schizophrenia risk. Thus, differences in DNA methylation at these loci may provide novel insights into potential mechanisms of neurodevelopment in offspring.© 2023.

"36895055","Extensive sequence duplication in Arabidopsis revealed by pseudo-heterozygosity.","Genome Biol","It is apparent that genomes harbor much structural variation that is largely undetected for technical reasons. Such variation can cause artifacts when short-read sequencing data are mapped to a reference genome. Spurious SNPs may result from mapping of reads to unrecognized duplicated regions. Calling SNP using the raw reads of the 1001 Arabidopsis Genomes Project we identified 3.3 million (44%) heterozygous SNPs. Given that Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana) is highly selfing, and that extensively heterozygous individuals have been removed, we hypothesize that these SNPs reflected cryptic copy number variation.The heterozygosity we observe consists of particular SNPs being heterozygous across individuals in a manner that strongly suggests it reflects shared segregating duplications rather than random tracts of residual heterozygosity due to occasional outcrossing. Focusing on such pseudo-heterozygosity in annotated genes, we use genome-wide association to map the position of the duplicates. We identify 2500 putatively duplicated genes and validate them using de novo genome assemblies from six lines. Specific examples included an annotated gene and nearby transposon that transpose together. We also demonstrate that cryptic structural variation produces highly inaccurate estimates of DNA methylation polymorphism.Our study confirms that most heterozygous SNP calls in A. thaliana are artifacts and suggest that great caution is needed when analyzing SNP data from short-read sequencing. The finding that 10% of annotated genes exhibit copy-number variation, and the realization that neither gene- nor transposon-annotation necessarily tells us what is actually mobile in the genome suggests that future analyses based on independently assembled genomes will be very informative.© 2023.

All these tumour types are rare and long-term clinical follow-up data are sparse. We retrospectively re-evaluated all children (0-18 years old) diagnosed with a CNS-PNET in Sweden during 1984-2015 and collected clinical data.In total, 88 supratentorial CNS-PNETs were identified in the Swedish Childhood Cancer Registry and from these formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumour material was available for 71 patients. These tumours were histopathologically re-evaluated and, in addition, analysed using genome-wide DNA methylation profiling and classified by the MNP brain tumour classifier.The most frequent tumour types, after histopathological re-evaluation, were HGG (35%) followed by AT/RT (11%), CNS NB-FOXR2 (10%) and ETMR (8%). DNA methylation profiling could further divide the tumours into specific subtypes and with a high accuracy classify these rare embryonal tumours. The 5 and 10-year overall survival (OS) for the whole CNS-PNET cohort was 45% ± 12% and 42% ± 12%, respectively. However, the different groups of tumour types identified after re-evaluation displayed very variable survival patterns, with a poor outcome for HGG and ETMR patients with 5-year OS 20% ± 16% and 33% ± 35%, respectively. On the contrary, high PFS and OS was observed for patients with CNS NB-FOXR2 (5-year 100% for both). Survival rates remained stable even after 15-years of follow-up.Our findings demonstrate, in a national based setting, the molecular heterogeneity of these tumours and show that DNA methylation profiling of these tumours provides an indispensable tool in distinguishing these rare tumours. Long-term follow-up data confirms previous findings with a favourable outcome for CNS NB-FOXR2 tumours and poor chances of survival for ETMR and HGG.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Here, we aimed to explore the pathophysiologic differences between PVL-OSCC and OSCC through transcriptomic and DNA methylation analyses.It is a case-control study. Oral biopsies from 8 PVL-OSCC and 10 OSCC patients were obtained for global sequencing using RNAseq and a genome-wide DNA methylation analysis via the Infinium EPIC Platform. (Graphical abstract) RESULTS: 133 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected, 94 of them upregulated in OSCC. Most of these genes were previously described in cancer and associated with prognosis. The integrative analysis revealed 26 DEGs, corresponding to 37 CpGs, whose promoters were regulated by DNA methylation. 29 of the CpGs were found as hypermethylated in PVL-OSCC. Only 5 of the genes that were aberrantly methylated and differentially expressed were upregulated in PVL-OSCC patients, whereas 21 were underexpressed.PVL-OSCC patients presented lower expression of cancer-related genes. Hypermethylation of the promoter region of many genes was also noticed, indicating that DNA methylation could be a regulatory mechanism.This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
"36891974","A novel method for predicting DNA N(4)-methylcytosine sites based on deep forest algorithm.","J Bioinform Comput Biol","N4-methyladenosine (4mC) methylation is an essential epigenetic modification of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that plays a key role in many biological processes such as gene expression, gene replication and transcriptional regulation. Genome-wide identification and analysis of the 4mC sites can better reveal the epigenetic mechanisms that regulate various biological processes. Although some high-throughput genomic experimental methods can effectively facilitate the identification in a genome-wide scale, they are still too expensive and laborious for routine use. Computational methods can compensate for these disadvantages, but they still leave much room for performance improvement. In this study, we develop a non-NN-style deep learning-based approach for accurately predicting 4mC sites from genomic DNA sequence. We generate various informative features represented sequence fragments around 4mC sites, and subsequently implement them into a deep forest (DF) model. After training the deep model using 10-fold cross-validation, the overall accuracies of 85.0%, 90.0%, and 87.8% were achieved for three representative model organisms,A. thaliana, C. elegans, andD. melanogaster, respectively. In addition, extensive experiment results show that our proposed approach outperforms other existing state-of-the-art predictors in the 4mC identification. Our approach stands for the first DF-based algorithm for the prediction of 4mC sites, providing a novel idea in this field."
"36891970","Exploiting the mediating role of the metabolome to unravel transcript-to-phenotype associations.","Elife","Despite the success of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in identifying genetic variants associated with complex traits, understanding the mechanisms behind these statistical associations remains challenging. Several methods that integrate methylation, gene expression, and protein quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with GWAS data to determine their causal role in the path from genotype to phenotype have been proposed. Here, we developed and applied a multi-omics Mendelian randomization (MR) framework to study how metabolites mediate the effect of gene expression on complex traits. We identified 216 transcript-metabolite-trait causal triplets involving 26 medically relevant phenotypes. Among these associations, 58% were missed by classical transcriptome-wide MR, which only uses gene expression and GWAS data. This allowed the identification of biologically relevant pathways, such as betweenANKHand calcium levels mediated by citrate levels andSLC6A12and serum creatinine through modulation of the levels of the renal osmolyte betaine. We show that the signals missed by transcriptome-wide MR are found, thanks to the increase in power conferred by integrating multiple omics layer. Simulation analyses show that with larger molecular QTL studies and in case of mediated effects, our multi-omics MR framework outperforms classical MR approaches designed to detect causal relationships between single molecular traits and complex phenotypes.© 2023, Auwerx et al."

To find more specific biomarkers of effect in occupational exposures to toxicants, DNA methylation studies in peripheral blood cells have been performed. The goal of this review is to summarize and contrast findings about DNA methylation in blood cells from workers exposed to toxicants.A literature search was performed using PubMed and Web of Science. After first screening, we discarded all studies performedin vitroand in experimental animals, as well as those performed in other cell types other than peripheral blood cells. Results: 116 original research papers met the established criteria, published from 2007 to 2022. The most frequent investigated exposures/labor group were for benzene (18.9%) polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (15.5%), particulate matter (10.3%), lead (8.6%), pesticides (7.7%), radiation (4.3%), volatile organic compound mixtures (4.3%), welding fumes (3.4%) chromium (2.5%), toluene (2.5%), firefighters (2.5%), coal (1.7%), hairdressers (1.7%), nanoparticles (1.7%), vinyl chloride (1.7%), and others. Few longitudinal studies have been performed, as well as few of them have explored mitochondrial DNA methylation. Methylation platforms have evolved from analysis in repetitive elements (global methylation), gene-specific promoter methylation, to epigenome-wide studies. The most reported observations were global hypomethylation as well as promoter hypermethylation in exposed groups compared to controls, while methylation at DNA repair/oncogenes genes were the most studied; studies from genome-wide studies detect differentially methylated regions, which could be either hypo or hypermethylated.Some evidence from longitudinal studies suggest that modifications observed in cross-sectional designs may be transitory; then, we cannot say that DNA methylation changes are predictive of disease development due to those exposures.Due to the heterogeneity in the genes studied, and scarcity of longitudinal studies, we are far away from considering DNA methylation changes as biomarkers of effect in occupational exposures, and nor can we establish a clear functional or pathological correlate for those epigenetic modifications associated with the studied exposures.Copyright © 2023 Jiménez-Garza, Ghosh, Barrow and Godderis."
"36891054","The transcriptomic and epigenetic alterations in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients of Chinese Tibetan and Han populations.","Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)","Due to the distinctive living environment, lifestyle, and diet, the Tibetan community in China has the lowest prevalence of T2DM and prediabetes among numerous ethnic groups, while Han community shows the highest statistic. In this study, we aim to conclude the clinical manifestations of both Tibetan and Han T2DM patients and their association with transcriptomic and epigenetic alterations.A cross-sectional study including 120 T2DM patients from Han and Tibetan ethnic groups were conducted between 2019 to 2021 at the Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. The various clinical features and laboratory tests were recorded and analyzed between the two groups. The genome-wide methylation pattern and RNA expression were determined by Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RBBS) and Poly (A) RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) from leucocytes of peripheral blood samples in 6 Han and 6 Tibetan patients. GO analysis and KEGG analysis were conducted in differentially expressed genes and those with differentially methylated regions.Compared to Han, Tibetan T2DM individuals intake more coarse grains, meat and yak butter, but less refined grains, vegetables and fruit. They also showed increased BMI, Hb, HbA1c, LDL, ALT, GGT and eGFR, and decreased level of BUN. Among the 12 patients in the exploratory cohort, we identified 5178 hypomethylated and 4787 hypermethylated regions involving 1613 genes in the Tibetan group. RNA-seq showed a total of 947 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two groups, with 523 up-regulated and 424 down-regulated in Tibetan patients. By integrating DNA methylation and RNA expression data, we identified 112 DEGs with differentially methylated regions (overlapping genes) and 14 DEGs with promoter-related DMRs. The functional enrichment analysis demonstrated that the overlapping genes were primarily involved in metabolic pathways, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, pathways in cancer and Rap1 signaling pathway.Our study demonstrates the clinical characteristics of T2DM differ subtly between various ethnic groups that may be related to epigenetic modifications, thus providing evidence and ideas for additional research on the genetic pattern of T2DM.Copyright © 2023 Wang, Liu, Wang and Chen."
"36890579","DNA methylation analysis identifies key transcription factors involved in mesenchymal stem cell osteogenic differentiation.","Biol Res","Knowledge about regulating transcription factors (TFs) for osteoblastogenesis from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is limited. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between genomic regions subject to DNA-methylation changes during osteoblastogenesis and the TFs known to directly interact with these regulatory regions.The genome-wide DNA-methylation signature of MSCs differentiated to osteoblasts and adipocytes was determined using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array. During adipogenesis no CpGs passed our test for significant methylation changes. Oppositely, during osteoblastogenesis we identified 2462 differently significantly methylated CpGs (adj. p < 0.05). These resided outside of CpGs islands and were significantly enriched in enhancer regions. We confirmed the correlation between DNA-methylation and gene expression. Accordingly, we developed a bioinformatic tool to analyse differentially methylated regions and the TFs interacting with them. By overlaying our osteoblastogenesis differentially methylated regions with ENCODE TF ChIP-seq data we obtained a set of candidate TFs associated to DNA-methylation changes. Among them, ZEB1 TF was highly related with DNA-methylation. Using RNA interference, we confirmed that ZEB1, and ZEB2, played a key role in adipogenesis and osteoblastogenesis processes. For clinical relevance, ZEB1 mRNA expression in human bone samples was evaluated. This expression positively correlated with weight, body mass index, and PPARγ expression.In this work we describe an osteoblastogenesis-associated DNA-methylation profile and, using these data, validate a novel computational tool to identify key TFs associated to age-related disease processes. By means of this tool we identified and confirmed ZEB TFs as mediators involved in the MSCs differentiation to osteoblasts and adipocytes, and obesity-related bone adiposity.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36889368","Dynamics of RNA m(5)C modification during brain development.","Genomics","Post-transcriptional RNA modifications have been recognized as key regulators of neuronal differentiation and synapse development in the mammalian brain. While distinct sets of 5-methylcytosine (m5C) modified mRNAs have been detected in neuronal cells and brain tissues, no study has been performed to characterize methylated mRNA profiles in the developing brain. Here, together with regular RNA-seq, we performed transcriptome-wide bisulfite sequencing to compare RNA cytosine methylation patterns in neural stem cells (NSCs), cortical neuronal cultures, and brain tissues at three postnatal stages. Among 501 m5C sites identified, approximately 6% are consistently methylated across all five conditions. Compared to m5C sites identified in NSCs, 96% of them were hypermethylated in neurons and enriched for genes involved in positive transcriptional regulation and axon extension. In addition, brains at the early postnatal stage demonstrated substantial changes in both RNA cytosine methylation and gene expression of RNA cytosine methylation readers, writers, and erasers. Furthermore, differentially methylated transcripts were significantly enriched for genes regulating synaptic plasticity. Altogether, this study provides a brain epitranscriptomic dataset as a new resource and lays the foundation for further investigations into the role of RNA cytosine methylation during brain development.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

We look back at lessons learned to date, highlight current developments in the field and areas of priority for future research. We also reflect on why epigenetic research on child and adolescent mental health currently lags behind other areas of epigenetic research and what we can do to overcome existing barriers.To move the field forward, we advocate for the need of large-scale, harmonized, collaborative efforts that explicitly account for the time-varying nature of epigenetic and mental health data across development.We conclude with a perspective on what the future may hold in terms of translational applications as more robust signals emerge from epigenetic research on child and adolescent mental health."
"36911092","Characteristics of circulating small noncoding RNAs in plasma and serum during human aging.","Aging Med (Milton)","Aging is a complicated process that triggers age-related disease susceptibility through intercellular communication in the microenvironment. While the classic secretome of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) including soluble factors, growth factors, and extracellular matrix remodeling enzymes are known to impact tissue homeostasis during the aging process, the effects of novel SASP components, extracellular small noncoding RNAs (sncRNAs), on human aging are not well established.Here, by utilizing 446 small RNA-seq samples from plasma and serum of healthy donors found in the Extracellular RNA (exRNA) Atlas data repository, we correlated linear and nonlinear features between circulating sncRNAs expression and age by the maximal information coefficient (MIC) relationship determination. Age predictors were generated by ensemble machine learning methods (Adaptive Boosting, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest) and core age-related sncRNAs were determined through weighted coefficients in machine learning models. Functional investigation was performed via target prediction of age-related miRNAs.We observed the number of highly expressed transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) showed positive and negative associations with age respectively. Two-variable (sncRNA expression and individual age) relationships were detected by MIC and sncRNAs-based age predictors were established, resulting in a forecast performance where allR2values were greater than 0.96 and root-mean-square errors (RMSE) were less than 3.7 years in three ensemble machine learning methods. Furthermore, important age-related sncRNAs were identified based on modeling and the biological pathways of age-related miRNAs were characterized by their predicted targets, including multiple pathways in intercellular communication, cancer and immune regulation.In summary, this study provides valuable insights into circulating sncRNAs expression dynamics during human aging and may lead to advanced understanding of age-related sncRNAs functions with further elucidation.© 2023 The Authors.

"36910594","Longitudinal phenotypic aging metrics in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging.","Nat Aging","To define metrics of phenotypic aging, it is essential to identify biological and environmental factors that influence the pace of aging. Previous attempts to develop aging metrics were hampered by cross-sectional designs and/or focused on younger populations. In the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), we collected longitudinally across the adult age range a comprehensive list of phenotypes within four domains (body composition, energetics, homeostatic mechanisms and neurodegeneration/neuroplasticity) and functional outcomes. We integrated individual deviations from population trajectories into a global longitudinal phenotypic metric of aging and demonstrate that accelerated longitudinal phenotypic aging is associated with faster physical and cognitive decline, faster accumulation of multimorbidity and shorter survival. These associations are more robust compared with the use of phenotypic and epigenetic measurements at a single time point. Estimation of these metrics required repeated measures of multiple phenotypes over time but may uniquely facilitate the identification of mechanisms driving phenotypic aging and subsequent age-related functional decline."
"36873743","Systematic estimation of biological age of in vitro cell culture systems by an age-associated marker panel.","Front Aging","Aging is a process that affects almost all multicellular organisms and since our population ages with increasing prevalence of age-related diseases, it is important to study basic processes involved in aging. Many studies have been published so far using different and often single age markers to estimate the biological age of organisms or different cell culture systems. However, comparability of studies is often hampered by the lack of a uniform panel of age markers. Consequently, we here suggest an easy-to-use biomarker-based panel of classical age markers to estimate the biological age of cell culture systems that can be used in standard cell culture laboratories. This panel is shown to be sensitive in a variety of aging conditions. We used primary human skin fibroblasts of different donor ages and additionally induced either replicative senescence or artificial aging by progerin overexpression. Using this panel, highest biological age was found for artificial aging by progerin overexpression. Our data display that aging varies depending on cell line and aging model and even from individual to individual showing the need for comprehensive analyses.Copyright © 2023 Hartmann, Herling, Hartmann, Köckritz, Fuellen, Walter and Hermann."

However, how well these models recapitulate the actual genomic landscape and cell function, as well as the drug-induced alterations, remains to be established. Newin vitromodels of drug exposure are needed to advance our understanding of how to protect or reverse molecular changes related to substance use disorders.We engineered a novel induced pluripotent stem cell-derived model of neural progenitor cells and neurons from cultured postmortem human skin fibroblasts, and directly compared these to isogenic brain tissue from the donor source. We assessed the maturity of the cell models across differentiation from stem cells to neurons using RNA cell type and maturity deconvolution analyses as well as DNA methylation epigenetic clocks trained on adult and fetal human tissue. As proof-of-concept of this model's utility for substance use disorder studies, we compared morphine- and cocaine-treated neurons to gene expression signatures in postmortem Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) and Cocaine Use Disorder (CUD) brains, respectively.Within each human subject (N = 2, 2 clones each), brain frontal cortex epigenetic age parallels that of skin fibroblasts and closely approximates the donor's chronological age; stem cell induction from fibroblast cells effectively sets the epigenetic clock to an embryonic age; and differentiation of stem cells to neural progenitor cells and then to neurons progressively matures the cellsviaDNA methylation and RNA gene expression readouts. In neurons derived from an individual who died of opioid overdose, morphine treatment induced alterations in gene expression similar to those previously observed in OUDex-vivobrain tissue, including differential expression of the immediate early gene EGR1, which is known to be dysregulated by opioid use.In summary, we introduce an iPSC model generated from human postmortem fibroblasts that can be directly compared to corresponding isogenic brain tissue and can be used to model perturbagen exposure such as that seen in opioid use disorder. Future studies with this and other postmortem-derived brain cellular models, including cerebral organoids, can be an invaluable tool for understanding mechanisms of drug-induced brain alterations.Copyright © 2023 Mendez, Grimm, Stertz, Gorski, Movva, Najera, Moriel, Meyer, Fries, Coarfa and Walss-Bass."

However, it is unknown how epigenetic aging fits within the context of known socioeconomic and behavioral associations with aging-related health outcomes in a large, population-based, and diverse sample. This study uses data from a representative, panel study of US older adults to examine the relationship between DNAm-based age acceleration measures in the prediction of cross-sectional and longitudinal health outcomes and mortality. We examine whether recent improvements to these scores, using principal component (PC)-based measures designed to remove some of the technical noise and unreliability in measurement, improve the predictive capability of these measures. We also examine how well DNAm-based measures perform against well-known predictors of health outcomes such as demographics, SES, and health behaviors. In our sample, age acceleration calculated using ""second and third generation clocks,"" PhenoAge, GrimAge, and DunedinPACE, is consistently a significant predictor of health outcomes including cross-sectional cognitive dysfunction, functional limitations and chronic conditions assessed 2 y after DNAm measurement, and 4-y mortality. PC-based epigenetic age acceleration measures do not significantly change the relationship of DNAm-based age acceleration measures to health outcomes or mortality compared to earlier versions of these measures. While the usefulness of DNAm-based age acceleration as a predictor of later life health outcomes is quite clear, other factors such as demographics, SES, mental health, and health behaviors remain equally, if not more robust, predictors of later life outcomes."

Although steroidal alkaloid metabolites have been identified inF. hupehensis, the dynamic changes in their levels during bulb development and their molecular regulatory mechanisms are poorly understood.In this study, integrative analyses of the bulbus phenotype, bioactive chemical investigations, and metabolome and transcriptome profiles were performed to systematically explore the variations in steroidal alkaloid metabolite levels and identify the genes modulating their accumulation and the corresponding regulatory mechanisms.The results showed that weight, size, and total alkaloid content of the regenerated bulbs reached a maximum at IM03 (post-withering stage, early July), whereas peiminine content reached a maximum at IM02 (withering stage, early June). There were no significant differences between IM02 and IM03, indicating that regenerated bulbs could be harvested appropriately in early June or July. Peiminine, peimine, tortifoline, hupehenine, korseveramine, delafrine, hericenone N-oxide, korseveridine, puqiedinone, pingbeinone, puqienine B, puqienine E, pingbeimine A, jervine, and ussuriedine levels were upregulated in IM02 and IM03, compared with IM01 (vigorous growth stage, early April). The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis indicated that the accumulation of steroidal alkaloid metabolites mainly occurred prior to IM02.HMGR1,DXR,CAS1,CYP 90A1, andDET2may play a positive role in peiminine, peimine, hupehenine, korseveramine, korseveridine, hericenone N-oxide, puqiedinone, delafrine, tortifoline, pingbeinone, puqienine B, puqienine E, pingbeimine A, jervine, and ussuriedine biosynthesis, whereas the downregulation ofFPS1,SQEand17-DHCRmay lead to a reduction in peimisine levels. Weighted gene correlation network analysis showed thatCYP 74A2-1, CYP 74A2-2, CYP 71A26-1,CYP 71A26-2, andCYP74Awere negatively correlated with peiminine and pingbeimine A, whereasCYP RandCYP707A1were positively correlated.. CYP 74A2-1andCYP 74A2-2may play a negative role in peimine and korseveridine biosynthesis, whereasCYP Rplays a positive role.

Advancements in understanding the heterogeneity of prostate cancer will help navigate through these challenges and ultimately benefit patients. In this study, we integrated single-cell sequencing for transposase-accessible chromatin and whole transcriptome in prostate cancer cell lines, aiming to decode the epigenetic plasticity upon enzalutamide (ENZ) treatment. By comparing the cell populations representing early-treatment response or resistance to the initial tumor cells, we identified seven signature gene sets; they present consistent trends of chromatin closing co-occurred with down-regulated genes during early response and chromatin opening with up-regulated genes upon maintaining drug resistance. In the molecular signatures, we found genesZNF337,MAPK15, andESRRGare favorable in progression-free prognosis during early response, while genesCCDC150,CCDC18, andPOC1Amarked poor prognosis underpinning the pre-existing drug resistance in The Cancer Genome Atlas prostate adenocarcinoma cohort. Ultimately, drug-target analyses nominated combinatory drug candidates to either enhance early-treatment response or potentially overcome ENZ resistance. Together, our integrative, single-cell multi-omics approach in pre-clinical models is effective in identifying informative signatures from complex molecular events, illustrating diverse drug responses in prostate cancer, and invoking novel combinatory drug strategies to inform clinical decision making.© 2023 The Author(s)."

To address this gap, we asked whether maternal reprogramming by the H3K4me1/2 demethylase SPR-5/LSD1/KDM1A, is regulated by the chromatin co-repressor protein, SPR-1/CoREST, in Caenorhabditis elegans and mice. In C. elegans, SPR-5 functions as part of a reprogramming switch together with the H3K9 methyltransferase MET-2. By examining germline development, fertility, and gene expression in double mutants between spr-1 and met-2, as well as fertility in double mutants between spr-1 and spr-5, we find that loss of SPR-1 results in a partial loss of SPR-5 maternal reprogramming function. In mice, we generated a separation of function Lsd1 M448V point mutation that compromises CoREST binding, but only slightly affects LSD1 demethylase activity. When maternal LSD1 in the oocyte is derived exclusively from this allele, the progeny phenocopy the increased perinatal lethality that we previously observed when LSD1 was reduced maternally. Together, these data are consistent with CoREST having a conserved function in facilitating maternal LSD1 epigenetic reprogramming.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Genetics Society of America 2023."
"36911294","3D-Epigenomic Regulation of Gene Transcription in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.","Adv Genet (Hoboken)","The fundamental cause of transcription dysregulation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains elusive. To investigate the underlying mechanisms, comprehensive 3D-epigenomic analyses are performed in cellular models of THLE2 (a normal hepatocytes cell line) and HepG2 (a hepatocellular carcinoma cell line) using integrative approaches for chromatin topology, genomic and epigenomic variation, and transcriptional output. Comparing the 3D-epigenomes in THLE2 and HepG2 reveal that most HCC-associated genes are organized in complex chromatin interactions mediated by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). Incorporation of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data enables the identification of non-coding genetic variants that are enriched in distal enhancers connecting to the promoters of HCC-associated genes via long-range chromatin interactions, highlighting their functional roles. Interestingly, CTCF binding and looping proximal to HCC-associated genes appear to form chromatin architectures that overarch RNAPII-mediated chromatin interactions. It is further demonstrated that epigenetic variants by DNA hypomethylation at a subset of CTCF motifs proximal to HCC-associated genes can modify chromatin topological configuration, which in turn alter RNAPII-mediated chromatin interactions and lead to dysregulation of transcription. Together, the 3D-epigenomic analyses provide novel insights of multifaceted interplays involving genetics, epigenetics, and chromatin topology in HCC cells.© 2022 The Authors.

In particular, epigenome editing is potentially useful in the treatment of genetic and other related diseases, including rare imprinted diseases, as it can regulate the expression of the epigenome of the target region, and thereby the causative gene, with minimal or no modification of the genomic DNA. Various efforts are underway to successfully apply epigenome editing in vivo, such as improving target specificity, enzymatic activity, and drug delivery for the development of reliable therapeutics. In this review, we introduce the latest findings, summarize the current limitations and future challenges in the practical application of epigenome editing for disease therapy, and introduce important factors to consider, such as chromatin plasticity, for a more effective epigenome editing-based therapy."

In screening DNA methylation markers and transcripts related to sperm motility, semen from three pairs of full-sibling Holstein bulls with high and low motility was subjected to reduced representation bisulphite sequencing. A total of 948 DMRs were found in 874 genes (gDMRs). Approximately 89% of gDMR-related genes harboured alternative splicing events, includingSMAD2, KIF17, andPBRM1. One DMR in exon 29 ofPBRM1with the highest 5mC ratio was found, and hypermethylation in this region was related to bull sperm motility. Furthermore, alternative splicing events at exon 29 ofPBRM1were found in bull testis, includingPBRM1-complete, PBRM1-SV1(exon 28 deletion), andPBRM1-SV2(exons 28-29 deletion).PBRM1-SV2exhibited significantly higher expression in adult bull testes than in newborn bull testes. In addition,PBRM1was localized to the redundant nuclear membrane of bull sperm, which might be related to sperm motility caused by sperm tail breakage. Therefore, the hypermethylation of exon 29 may be associated with the production ofPBRM1-SV2in spermatogenesis. These findings indicated that DNA methylation alteration at specific loci could regulate gene splicing and expression and synergistically alter sperm structure and motility."

Therefore, computationally enhancing GWAS on existing samples may be particularly valuable. Here, we describe DeepGWAS, a deep neural network-based method to enhance GWAS by integrating GWAS results with linkage disequilibrium and brain-related functional annotations. DeepGWAS enhanced schizophrenia (SCZ) loci by ~3X when applied to the largest European GWAS, and 21.3% enhanced loci were validated by the latest multi-ancestry GWAS. Importantly, DeepGWAS models can be transferred to other neuropsychiatric disorders. Transferring SCZ-trained models to Alzheimerâ€™s disease and major depressive disorder, we observed 1.3-17.6X detected loci compared to standard GWAS, among which 27-40% were validated by other GWAS studies.

A recent landmark SCZ study of the protein-coding regions of the genome identified a causal role for ten genes and a concentration of rare variant signals in evolutionarily constrained genes1. This recent study-and most other large-scale human genetics studies-was mainly composed of individuals of European (EUR) ancestry, and the generalizability of the findings in non-EUR populations remains unclear. To address this gap, we designed a custom sequencing panel of 161 genes selected based on the current knowledge of SCZ genetics and sequenced a new cohort of 11,580 SCZ cases and 10,555 controls of diverse ancestries. Replicating earlier work, we found that cases carried a significantly higher burden of rare protein-truncating variants (PTVs) among evolutionarily constrained genes (odds ratio = 1.48; P = 5.4 × 10-6). In meta-analyses with existing datasets totaling up to 35,828 cases and 107,877 controls, this excess burden was largely consistent across five ancestral populations. Two genes (SRRM2 and AKAP11) were newly implicated as SCZ risk genes, and one gene (PCLO) was identified as shared by individuals with SCZ and those with autism. Overall, our results lend robust support to the rare allelic spectrum of the genetic architecture of SCZ being conserved across diverse human populations.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36873096","Low and differential polygenic score generalizability among African populations due largely to genetic diversity.","HGG Adv","African populations are vastly underrepresented in genetic studies but have the most genetic variation and face wide-ranging environmental exposures globally. Because systematic evaluations of genetic prediction had not yet been conducted in ancestries that span African diversity, we calculated polygenic risk scores (PRSs) in simulations across Africa and in empirical data from South Africa, Uganda, and the United Kingdom to better understand the generalizability of genetic studies. PRS accuracy improves with ancestry-matched discovery cohorts more than from ancestry-mismatched studies. Within ancestrally and ethnically diverse South African individuals, we find that PRS accuracy is low for all traits but varies across groups. Differences in African ancestries contribute more to variability in PRS accuracy than other large cohort differences considered between individuals in the United Kingdom versus Uganda. We computed PRS in African ancestry populations using existing European-only versus ancestrally diverse genetic studies; the increased diversity produced the largest accuracy gains for hemoglobin concentration and white blood cell count, reflecting large-effect ancestry-enriched variants in genes known to influence sickle cell anemia and the allergic response, respectively. Differences in PRS accuracy across African ancestries originating from diverse regions are as large as across out-of-Africa continental ancestries, requiring commensurate nuance.© 2023 The Authors."

Studies suggest changes in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) activity as a potential contributor. Whether maladaptive changes in inhibitory interneurons participate in this process, and whether adaptations in response to stress differ between men and women, producing sex-specific changes in emotional behaviors and mPFC activity, remained undetermined. This study examined whether unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) in mice differentially alters behavior and mPFC parvalbumin (PV) interneuron activity by sex, and whether the activity of these neurons drives sex-specific behavioral changes. Four weeks of UCMS increased anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors associated with FosB activation in mPFC PV neurons, particularly in females. After 8 weeks of UCMS, both sexes displayed these behavioral and neural changes. Chemogenetic activation of PV neurons in UCMS-exposed and nonstressed males induced significant changes in anxiety-like behaviors. Importantly, patch-clamp electrophysiology demonstrated altered excitability and basic neural properties on the same timeline as the emergence of behavioral effects: changes in females after 4 weeks and in males after 8 weeks of UCMS. These findings show, for the first time, that sex-specific changes in the excitability of prefrontal PV neurons parallel the emergence of anxiety-like behavior, revealing a potential novel mechanism underlying the enhanced vulnerability of females to stress-induced psychopathology and supporting further investigation of this neuronal population to identify new therapeutic targets for stress disorders.Copyright © 2023 Woodward et al."

Patients with severe anorexia (compared to mild forms) were older (F = 5.33;p= 0.02), engaged in more frequent substance misuse (χ2= 3.75; OR = 3.86;p= 0.05) and had a lower NLR (F = 4.12;p= 0.05). Only a lower NLR was predictive of severe manifestations of AN (OR = 0.007;p= 0.031). Overall, our study suggests that immune alterations may be predictive of AN severity. In more severe forms of AN, the response of the adaptive immunity is preserved, while the activation of the innate immunity may be reduced. Further studies with larger samples and a wider panel of biochemical markers are needed to confirm the present results."
"36889809","Systemic inflammation shapes clinical outcomes in response to immune checkpoint blockade treatment: moving toward optimizing antitumor immunity.","J Immunother Cancer","Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) treatment may induce durable disease remission, but only in a minority of patients with cancer. One important question is how to identify patients who may benefit from ICB treatment. ICB treatment relies on unleashing patients' pre-existing immune responses. Focusing on the key components of immune response, this study proposes the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) as a simplified indicator of patients' immune status to predict ICB treatment outcomes.This study analyzed a large pan-cancer cohort of 16 cancer types, including 1714 patients with cancer who received ICB treatment. Clinical outcomes in response to ICB treatment were measured by overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate, and clinical benefit rate. The non-linear relationships of NLR with OS and PFS were investigated by a spline-based multivariate Cox regression model. A total of 1000 randomly resampled cohorts were bootstrapped to estimate the variability and reproducibility of NLR-related ICB responses.By interrogating a clinically representative cohort, this study revealed a previously unreported finding that the pretreatment NLR levels were associated with ICB treatment outcomes in a U-shaped dose-dependent manner rather than a linear manner. An NLR range between 2.0 and 3.0 was remarkably associated with optimal ICB treatment outcomes, including increased patient survival, delayed disease progression, improved treatment response, and significant clinical benefit. Comparatively, either decreasing (< 2.0) or increasing (>3.0) NLR levels were indicators of worse ICB treatment outcomes. Furthermore, this study presents a comprehensive landscape of NLR-related ICB treatment outcomes across different patient populations defined by demographics, baseline characteristics, treatment, cancer-type-specific ICB responsiveness, and individual cancer type.The NLR range from 2.0 to 3.0 might indicate an optimal balance between innate (neutrophils) and adaptive (lymphocytes) immune responses that potentiates antitumor immunity, which was observed in only 18.6% of patients. A majority of patients showed decreasing NLR (<2.00; 10.9% patients) or increasing NLR (>3.00; 70.5% patients), representing two distinct types of immune dysregulation associated with ICB resistance. This study translates routine blood tests into a precision medicine-based approach to immunotherapy, with important implications for clinicians in clinical decision-making as well as for regulatory agencies in drug approvals.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

The impact of gut microbiota on lung disease has been widely documented. Diet, environment, and genetics all play a role in shaping the gut microbiota, which can influence the immune system. Improving the gut microbiota profile through customized diet, nutrition, and supplementation has been shown to boost immunity, which could be one of the preventative methods for reducing the impact of various diseases. Poor nutritional status is frequently linked to inflammation and oxidative stress, both of which can affect the immune system. This review emphasizes the necessity of maintaining an adequate level of important nutrients to effectively minimize inflammation and oxidative stress, moreover to strengthen the immune system during the COVID-19 severity. Furthermore, the purpose of this review is to present information and viewpoints on the use of probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics as adjuvants for microbiota modification and its effects on COVID-19 prevention and treatment.© 2023 The Authors.

"36891511","Deciphering transcription factors and their corresponding regulatory elements during inhibitory interneuron differentiation using deep neural networks.","Front Cell Dev Biol","During neurogenesis, the generation and differentiation of neuronal progenitors into inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid-containing interneurons is dependent on the combinatorial activity of transcription factors (TFs) and their corresponding regulatory elements (REs). However, the roles of neuronal TFs and their target REs in inhibitory interneuron progenitors are not fully elucidated. Here, we developed a deep-learning-based framework to identify enriched TF motifs in gene REs (eMotif-RE), such as poised/repressed enhancers and putative silencers. Using epigenetic datasets (e.g., ATAC-seq and H3K27ac/me3 ChIP-seq) from cultured interneuron-like progenitors, we distinguished between active enhancer sequences (open chromatin with H3K27ac) and non-active enhancer sequences (open chromatin without H3K27ac). Using our eMotif-RE framework, we discovered enriched motifs of TFs such as ASCL1, SOX4, and SOX11 in the active enhancer set suggesting a cooperativity function for ASCL1 and SOX4/11 in active enhancers of neuronal progenitors. In addition, we found enriched ZEB1 and CTCF motifs in the non-active set. Using anin vivoenhancer assay, we showed that most of the tested putative REs from the non-active enhancer set have no enhancer activity. Two of the eight REs (25%) showed function as poised enhancers in the neuronal system. Moreover, mutated REs for ZEB1 and CTCF motifs increased theirin vivoactivity as enhancers indicating a repressive effect of ZEB1 and CTCF on these REs that likely function as repressed enhancers or silencers. Overall, our work integrates a novel framework based on deep learning together with a functional assay that elucidated novel functions of TFs and their corresponding REs. Our approach can be applied to better understand gene regulation not only in inhibitory interneuron differentiation but in other tissue and cell types.Copyright © 2023 Alatawneh, Salomon, Eshel, Orenstein and Birnbaum."

The differences are most prominent for sex-chromosome-linked genes and attributable to Escape from X chromosome-linked inactivation and Y chromosome loss. The frequency distribution of RCC histologies varies between the sexes, particularly for papillary, chromophobe, and translocation RCC. In clear-cell and papillary RCC, sex-specific gene expressions are pronounced, and some of these genes are amenable to pharmacotherapy. However, for many, the impact on tumorigenesis remains poorly understood. In clear-cell RCC, molecular subtypes and gene expression pathways have distinct sex-specific trends, which also apply to the expression of genes implicated in tumor progression.Current evidence suggests meaningful genomic differences between male and female RCC, highlighting the need for sex-specific RCC research and personalized sex-specific treatment approaches.© 2023.

Despite extensive work in the field, the pathogenesis of AH is still incompletely understood, and its treatment remains challenging. Recent evidence has shown a deep involvement of epigenetic signals in the regulation of transcriptional programs underpinning maladaptive vascular remodeling, sympathetic activation and cardiometabolic alterations, all factors predisposing to AH. After occurring, these epigenetic changes have a long-lasting effect on gene dysregulation and do not seem to be reversible upon intensive treatment or the control of cardiovascular risk factors. Among the factors involved in arterial hypertension, microvascular dysfunction plays a central role. This review will focus on the emerging role of epigenetic changes in hypertensive-related microvascular disease, including the different cell types and tissues (endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells and perivascular adipose tissue) as well as the involvement of mechanical/hemodynamic factors, namely, shear stress."

The inhalation of air pollutants, such as ozone, can participate in the development of oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, insulin resistance, endothelium dysfunction, and epigenetic modification. Metabolic alterations in blood in components of metabolic syndrome (MS) and short-term ambient air ozone exposure were determined and evaluated longitudinally in a cohort of 372 adolescents aged between 9 to 19 years old. We used longitudinal mixed-effects models to evaluate the association between ozone exposure and the risk of components of metabolic syndrome and its parameters separately, adjusted using important variables. We observed statistically significant associations between exposure to ozone in tertiles in different lag days and the parameters associated with MS, especially for triglycerides (20.20 mg/dL, 95% CI: 9.5, 30.9), HDL cholesterol (-2.56 mg/dL (95% CI: -5.06, -0.05), and systolic blood pressure (1.10 mmHg, 95% CI: 0.08, 2.2).

A pan-cancer genome analysis of tumors with loss of Y chromosome.","Comput Struct Biotechnol J","Loss of the Y chromosome (LoY) is frequently observed in somatic cells of elderly men. However, LoY is highly increased in tumor tissue and correlates with an overall worse prognosis. The underlying causes and downstream effects of LoY are widely unknown. Therefore, we analyzed genomic and transcriptomic data of 13 cancer types (2375 patients) and classified tumors of male patients according to loss or retain of the Y chromosome (LoY or RoY, average LoY fraction: 0.46). The frequencies of LoY ranged from almost absence (glioblastoma, glioma, thyroid carcinoma) to 77% (kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma). Genomic instability, aneuploidy, and mutation burden were enriched in LoY tumors. In addition, we found more frequently in LoY tumors the gate keeping tumor suppressor geneTP53mutated in three cancer types (colon adenocarcinoma, head and neck squamous carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma) and oncogenesMET, CDK6, KRAS,andEGFRamplified in multiple cancer types. On the transcriptomic level, we observedMMP13, known to be involved in invasion, to be up-regulated in LoY of three adenocarcinomas and down-regulation of the tumor suppressor geneGPC5in LoY of three cancer types. Furthermore, we found enrichment of a smoking-related mutation signature in LoY tumors of head and neck and lung cancer. Strikingly, we observed a correlation between cancer type-specific sex bias in incidence rates and frequencies of LoY, in line with the hypothesis that LoY increases cancer risk in males. Overall, LoY is a frequent phenomenon in cancer that is enriched in genomically unstable tumors. It correlates with genomic features beyond the Y chromosome and might contribute to higher incidence rates in males.© 2023 The Authors."

Many genes and pathways are known to regulate milk composition, and the purpose of this review is to highlight how the discoveries of quantitative trait loci (QTL) for milk phenotypes can elucidate these pathways. The main body of this review focuses primarily on QTL discovered in cattle (Bos taurus) as a model species for the biology of lactation, and there are occasional references to sheep genetics. The following section describes a range of techniques that can be used to help identify the causative genes underlying QTL when the underlying mechanism involves the regulation of gene expression. As genotype and phenotype databases continue to grow and diversify, new QTL will continue to be discovered, and although proving the causality of underlying genes and variants remains difficult, these new data sets will further enhance our understanding of the biology of lactation."

"36873395","Genetics and pathophysiology of mitral valve prolapse.","Front Cardiovasc Med","Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a common condition affecting 2-3% of the general population, and the most complex form of valve pathology, with a complication rate up to 10-15% per year in advanced stages. Complications include mitral regurgitation which can lead to heart failure and atrial fibrillation, but also life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia and cardiovascular death. Sudden death has been recently brought to the forefront of MVP disease, increasing the complexity of management and suggesting that MVP condition is not properly understood. MVP can occur as part of syndromic conditions such as Marfan syndrome, but the most common form is non-syndromic, isolated or familial. Although a specific X-linked form of MVP was initially identified, autosomal dominant inheritance appears to be the primary mode of transmission. MVP can be stratified into myxomatous degeneration (Barlow), fibroelastic deficiency, and Filamin A-related MVP. While FED is still considered a degenerative disease associated with aging, myxomatous MVP and FlnA-MVP are recognized as familial pathologies. Deciphering genetic defects associated to MVP is still a work in progress; althoughFLNA,DCHS1, andDZIP1have been identified as causative genes in myxomatous forms of MVP thanks to familial approaches, they explain only a small proportion of MVP. In addition, genome-wide association studies have revealed the important role of common variants in the development of MVP, in agreement with the high prevalence of this condition in the population. Furthermore, a potential genetic link between MVP and ventricular arrhythmia or a specific type of cardiomyopathy is considered. Animal models that allow to advance in the genetic and pathophysiological knowledge of MVP, and in particular those that can be easily manipulated to express a genetic defect identified in humans are detailed. Corroborated by genetic data and animal models, the main pathophysiological pathways of MVP are briefly addressed. Finally, genetic counseling is considered in the context of MVP.Copyright © 2023 Delwarde, Capoulade, Mérot, Le Scouarnec, Bouatia-Naji, Yu, Huttin, Selton-Suty, Sellal, Piriou, Schott, Dina and Le Tourneau."

A phenome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) study was conducted to explore the associations of genetically-proxied TYK2 inhibition with 1473 disease outcomes in UK Biobank (N = 339,197). Identified associations were examined for replication in FinnGen (N = 260,405). We further performed tissue-specific gene expression MR, colocalization analyses, and MR with 247 blood biomarkers. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on TYK2 inhibitor was performed to complement the genetic evidence.PheWAS-MR found that genetically-proxied TYK2 inhibition was associated with lower risk of a wide range of autoimmune diseases. The associations with hypothyroidism and psoriasis were confirmed in MR analysis of tissue-specific TYK2 gene expression and the associations with systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis were observed in colocalization analysis. There were nominal associations of genetically-proxied TYK2 inhibition with increased risk of prostate and breast cancer but not in tissue-specific expression MR or colocalization analyses. Thirty-seven blood biomarkers were associated with the TYK2 loss-of-function mutation.

"36906694","Shared genetic architecture between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and lifespan.","Neuropsychopharmacology","There is evidence linking ADHD to a reduced life expectancy. The mortality rate in individuals with ADHD is twice that of the general population and it is associated with several factors, such as unhealthy lifestyle behaviors, social adversity, and mental health problems that may in turn increase mortality rates. Since ADHD and lifespan are heritable, we used data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of ADHD and parental lifespan, as proxy of individual lifespan, to estimate their genetic correlation, identify genetic loci jointly associated with both phenotypes and assess causality. We confirmed a negative genetic correlation between ADHD and parental lifespan (rg = -0.36, P = 1.41e-16). Nineteen independent loci were jointly associated with both ADHD and parental lifespan, with most of the alleles that increased the risk for ADHD being associated with shorter lifespan. Fifteen loci were novel for ADHD and two were already present in the original GWAS on parental lifespan. Mendelian randomization analyses pointed towards a negative causal effect of ADHD liability on lifespan (P = 1.54e-06; Beta = -0.07), although these results were not confirmed by all sensitivity analyses performed, and further evidence is required. The present study provides the first evidence of a common genetic background between ADHD and lifespan, which may play a role in the reported effect of ADHD on premature mortality risk. These results are consistent with previous epidemiological data describing reduced lifespan in mental disorders and support that ADHD is an important health condition that could negatively affect future life outcomes.© 2023.

We carried out the first multivariate genome-wide association study (GWAS) of amygdala subfield volumes in 27,866 UK Biobank individuals. The whole amygdala was segmented into nine nuclei groups using Bayesian amygdala segmentation. The post-GWAS analysis allowed us to identify causal genetic variants in phenotypes at the SNP, locus, and gene levels, as well as genetic overlap with brain health-related traits. We further generalized our GWAS in Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) cohort. The multivariate GWAS identified 98 independent significant variants within 32 genomic loci associated (P < 5 × 10-8) with amygdala volume and its nine nuclei. The univariate GWAS identified significant hits for eight of the ten volumes, tagging 14 independent genomic loci. Overall, 13 of the 14 loci identified in the univariate GWAS were replicated in the multivariate GWAS. The generalization in ABCD cohort supported the GWAS results with the 12q23.2 (RNA gene RP11-210L7.1) being discovered. All of these imaging phenotypes are heritable, with heritability ranging from 15% to 27%.

Despite the unique opportunity retinal structures offer for assessing brain disorders, less is known about their relationship to brain structure and function. Here we present a systematic cross-organ genetic architecture analysis of eye-brain connections using retina and brain imaging endophenotypes. Novel phenotypic and genetic links were identified between retinal imaging biomarkers and brain structure and function measures derived from multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), many of which were involved in the visual pathways, including the primary visual cortex. In 65 genomic regions, retinal imaging biomarkers shared genetic influences with brain diseases and complex traits, 18 showing more genetic overlaps with brain MRI traits. Mendelian randomization suggests that retinal structures have bidirectional genetic causal links with neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease. Overall, cross-organ imaging genetics reveals a genetic basis for eye-brain connections, suggesting that the retinal images can elucidate genetic risk factors for brain disorders and disease-related changes in intracranial structure and function."

Specifically, recent single-cell/nucleus RNA sequencing (sc/nRNA-seq) studies identified a transcriptionally distinct state of subsets of macrophages in aging or degenerating brains (usually referred to as disease- associated microglia or DAM) and in other diseased lipid-rich tissues (e.g., obese adipose tissue, fatty liver, and atherosclerotic plaques). We collectively refer to these subpopulations as lipid-associated macrophages or LAMs. Importantly, this particular activation state is characterized by increased expression of genes involved in the phagocytic clearance of lipid-rich cellular debris (efferocytosis), including several AD risk genes.We used sc/nRNA-seq data from human and mouse microglia from healthy and diseased brains and macrophages from other lipid-rich tissues to reconstruct gene regulatory networks and identify transcriptional regulators whose regulons are enriched for LAM response genes (LAM TFs) across species. We then used gene knock- down/knock-out strategies to validate some of these LAM TFs in human THP-1 macrophages and iPSC-derived microgliain vitro, as well as mouse microgliain vivo.We nominate 11 strong candidate LAM TFs shared across human and mouse networks (BHLHE41,HIF1A,ID2,JUNB,MAF,MAFB,MEF2A,MEF2C,NACA, POU2F2andSPI1). We also demonstrate a strong enrichment of AD risk alleles in the cistrome ofBHLHE41(and its close homologBHLHE40), thus implicating its regulon in the modulation of disease susceptibility. Loss or reduction ofBHLHE40/41expression in human THP-1 macrophages and iPSC-derived microglia, as well as loss ofBhlhe40/41in mouse microglia led to increased expression of LAM response genes, specifically those involved in cholesterol clearance and lysosomal processing, with a concomitant increase in cholesterol efflux and storage, as well as lysosomal mass and degradative capacity.Taken together, this study nominates transcriptional regulators of the LAM response, experimentally validates BHLHE40/41 in human and mouse macrophages/microglia, and provides novel targets for therapeutic modulation of macrophage/microglia function in AD and other disorders of lipid-rich tissues."

"36914805","Rank concordance of polygenic indices.","Nat Hum Behav","Polygenic indices (PGIs) are increasingly used to identify individuals at risk of developing disease and are advocated as screening tools for personalized medicine and education. Here we empirically assess rank concordance between PGIs created with different construction methods and discovery samples, focusing on cardiovascular disease and educational attainment. We find Spearman rank correlations between 0.17 and 0.93 for cardiovascular disease, and 0.40 and 0.83 for educational attainment, indicating highly unstable rankings across different PGIs for the same trait. Potential consequences for personalized medicine and gene-environment (G × E) interplay are illustrated using data from the UK Biobank. Simulations show how rank discordance mainly derives from a limited discovery sample size and reveal a tight link between the explained variance of a PGI and its ranking precision. We conclude that PGI-based ranking is highly dependent on PGI choice, such that current PGIs do not have the desired precision to be used routinely for personalized intervention.© 2023.

"36910644","Vascular endothelial growth factor and risk of malignant brain tumor: A genetic correlation and two-sample Mendelian randomization study.","Front Oncol","The relationship between vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the risk of malignant brain tumors has always been a concern in the medical field. However, the causal inferences from published observational studies on this issue may be affected by confounders, coinheritability and reverse causality. We aimed to investigate the causal relationship between VEGF and different types of malignant brain tumors.Using publicly available summary data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of VEGF (n=16,112) and different types of malignant brain tumors (n=174,097-174,646), we adopted a standard two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) to estimate potential causal associations of circulating VEGF levels and the risk of malignant brain tumors. Inverse variance weighted (IVW) was used as the primary analysis method to estimate causality. MR-Egger regression, weighted median (WM), penalty weighted median (PWM), MR robust adjusted profile score (MR.RAPS) and causal analysis using summary effect estimates (CAUSE) methods were used in sensitivity analyses to verify the robustness of the findings. Meanwhile, we applied the MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO) test and PhenoScanner tool to identify and remove potential horizontal pleiotropic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Additionally, linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) analysis was conducted to assess the coinheritability of exposure and outcome.A total of 6 (VEGF), 12 (malignant brain tumor), 13 (brain glioblastoma) and 12 (malignant neoplasm of meninges) SNPs were identified as valid instrumental variables. No evidence supported a causal relationship between circulating VEGF levels and the risk of malignant brain tumors (forwards: odds ratio (OR) = 1.277, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.812~2.009; reversed: β = 0.005, 95% CI, -0.029~0.038), brain glioblastoma (forwards: OR (95% CI) = 1.278(0.463~3.528); reversed: β = 0.010, 95% CI, -0.002~0.022) and malignant neoplasm of meninges (forwards: OR (95% CI) = 0.831(0.486~1.421); reversed: β = 0.010, 95% CI, -0.030~0.050) using the main IVW method. Outliers and pleiotropy bias were not detected by sensitivity analyses and pleiotropy-robust methods in any estimates. LDSC failed to identify genetic correlations between VEGF and different types of malignant brain tumors.Our findings reported no coinheritability and failed to provide evidence for causal associations between VEGF and the risk of different types of malignant brain tumors. However, certain subtypes of VEGF for which genetic predictors have not been identified may play a role and need to be further investigated.Copyright © 2023 Zhang, Wu, Zhang, Zhang, Jiang, Zhang, Ding and Wang."
"36899000","Shared genetic liability for alcohol consumption, alcohol problems, and suicide attempt: Evaluating the role of impulsivity.","Transl Psychiatry","Heavy drinking and diagnosis with alcohol use disorder (AUD) are consistently associated with risk for suicide attempt (SA). Though the shared genetic architecture among alcohol consumption and problems (ACP) and SA remains largely uncharacterized, impulsivity has been proposed as a heritable, intermediate phenotype for both alcohol problems and suicidal behavior. The present study investigated the extent to which shared liability for ACP and SA is genetically related to five dimensions of impulsivity. Analyses incorporated summary statistics from genome-wide association studies of alcohol consumption (N = 160,824), problems (N = 160,824), and dependence (N = 46,568), alcoholic drinks per week (N = 537,349), suicide attempt (N = 513,497), impulsivity (N = 22,861), and extraversion (N = 63,030). We used genomic structural equation modeling (Genomic SEM) to, first, estimate a common factor model with alcohol consumption, problems, and dependence, drinks per week, and SA included as indicators. Next, we evaluated the correlations between this common genetic factor and five factors representing genetic liability to negative urgency, positive urgency, lack of premeditation, sensation-seeking, and lack of perseverance. Common genetic liability to ACP and SA was significantly correlated with all five impulsive personality traits examined (rs = 0.24-0.53, ps < 0.002), and the largest correlation was with lack of premeditation, though supplementary analyses suggested that these findings were potentially more strongly influenced by ACP than SA. These analyses have potential implications for screening and prevention: Impulsivity can be comprehensively assessed in childhood, whereas heavy drinking and suicide attempt are quite rare prior to adolescence. Our findings provide preliminary evidence that features of impulsivity may serve as early indicators of genetic risk for alcohol problems and suicidality.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36894673","Genome- and transcriptome-wide splicing associations with alcohol use disorder.","Sci Rep","Genetic mechanisms of alternative mRNA splicing have been shown in the brain for a variety of neuropsychiatric traits, but not substance use disorders. Our study utilized RNA-sequencing data on alcohol use disorder (AUD) in four brain regions (n = 56; ages 40-73; 100% 'Caucasian'; PFC, NAc, BLA and CEA) and genome-wide association data on AUD (n = 435,563, ages 22-90; 100% European-American). Polygenic scores of AUD were associated with AUD-related alternative mRNA splicing in the brain. We identified 714 differentially spliced genes between AUD vs controls, which included both putative addiction genes and novel gene targets. We found 6463 splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs) that linked to the AUD differentially spliced genes. sQTLs were enriched in loose chromatin genomic regions and downstream gene targets. Additionally, the heritability of AUD was enriched for DNA variants in and around differentially spliced genes associated with AUD. Our study also performed splicing transcriptome-wide association studies (TWASs) of AUD and other drug use traits that unveiled specific genes for follow-up and splicing correlations across SUDs. Finally, we showed that differentially spliced genes between AUD vs control were also associated with primate models of chronic alcohol consumption in similar brain regions. Our study found substantial genetic contributions of alternative mRNA splicing in AUD.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Such cells can be non-invasively imaged using optical coherence tomography (OCT) which is used in clinical settings to diagnose and monitor ocular diseases. Here we present the largest genome-wide association study of PRC morphology to date utilising quantitative phenotypes extracted from OCT images within the UK Biobank. We discovered 111 loci associated with the thickness of one or more of the PRC layers, many of which had prior associations to ocular phenotypes and pathologies, and 27 with no prior associations. We further identified 10 genes associated with PRC thickness through gene burden testing using exome data. In both cases there was a significant enrichment for genes involved in rare eye pathologies, in particular retinitis pigmentosa. There was evidence for an interaction effect between common genetic variants, VSX2 involved in eye development and PRPH2 known to be involved in retinal dystrophies. We further identified a number of genetic variants with a differential effect across the macular spatial field. Our results suggest a continuum between common and rare variation which impacts retinal structure, sometimes leading to disease.Copyright: © 2023 Currant et al.

Here, the SCALLOP Consortium conducted a genome-wide association meta-analysis of over 12,500 individuals for 184 neuro-related proteins in human plasma. The analysis identified 117 cis-regulatory protein quantitative trait loci (cis-pQTL) and 166 trans-pQTL. The mapped pQTL capture on average 50% of each protein's heritability. Mendelian randomization analyses revealed multiple proteins showing potential causal effects on neuro-related traits as well as complex diseases such as hypertension, high cholesterol, immune-related disorders, and psychiatric disorders. Integrating with established drug information, we validated 13 combinations of protein targets and diseases or side effects with available drugs, while suggesting hundreds of re-purposing and new therapeutic targets for diseases and comorbidities.

"36658437","Genome-wide meta-analysis identifies 93 risk loci and enables risk prediction equivalent to monogenic forms of venous thromboembolism.","Nat Genet","We report a genome-wide association study of venous thromboembolism (VTE) incorporating 81,190 cases and 1,419,671 controls sampled from six cohorts. We identify 93 risk loci, of which 62 are previously unreported. Many of the identified risk loci are at genes encoding proteins with functions converging on the coagulation cascade or platelet function. A VTE polygenic risk score (PRS) enabled effective identification of both high- and low-risk individuals. Individuals within the top 0.1% of PRS distribution had a VTE risk similar to homozygous or compound heterozygous carriers of the variants G20210A (c.*97 G > A) in F2 and p.R534Q in F5. We also document that F2 and F5 mutation carriers in the bottom 10% of the PRS distribution had a risk similar to that of the general population. We further show that PRS improved individual risk prediction beyond that of genetic and clinical risk factors. We investigated the extent to which venous and arterial thrombosis share clinical risk factors using Mendelian randomization, finding that some risk factors for arterial thrombosis were directionally concordant with VTE risk (for example, body mass index and smoking) whereas others were discordant (for example, systolic blood pressure and triglyceride levels).© 2023.

"36881318","Integrating polygenic and clinical risks to improve stroke risk stratification in prospective Chinese cohorts.","Sci China Life Sci","The utility of the polygenic risk score (PRS) to identify individuals at higher risk of stroke beyond clinical risk remains unclear, and we clarified this using Chinese population-based prospective cohorts. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the 10-year risk, and Fine and Gray's models were used for hazard ratios (HRs), their 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and the lifetime risk according to PRS and clinical risk categories. A total of 41,006 individuals aged 30-75 years with a mean follow-up of 9.0 years were included. Comparing the top versus bottom 5% of the PRS, the HR was 3.01 (95%CI 2.03-4.45) in the total population, and similar findings were observed within clinical risk strata. Marked gradients in the 10-year and lifetime risk across PRS categories were also found within clinical risk categories. Notably, among individuals with intermediate clinical risk, the 10-year risk for those in the top 5% of the PRS (7.3%, 95%CI 7.1%-7.5%) reached the threshold of high clinical risk (⩾7.0%) for initiating preventive treatment, and this effect of the PRS on refining risk stratification was evident for ischemic stroke. Even among those in the top 10% and 20% of the PRS, the 10-year risk would also exceed this level when aged ⩾50 and ⩾60 years, respectively. Overall, the combination of the PRS with the clinical risk score improved the risk stratification within clinical risk strata and distinguished actual high-risk individuals with intermediate clinical risk.© 2023.

"36893104","Detection of genes with differential expression dispersion unravels the role of autophagy in cancer progression.","PLoS Comput Biol","The majority of gene expression studies focus on the search for genes whose mean expression is different between two or more populations of samples in the so-called ""differential expression analysis"" approach. However, a difference in variance in gene expression may also be biologically and physiologically relevant. In the classical statistical model used to analyze RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data, the dispersion, which defines the variance, is only considered as a parameter to be estimated prior to identifying a difference in mean expression between conditions of interest. Here, we propose to evaluate four recently published methods, which detect differences in both the mean and dispersion in RNA-seq data. We thoroughly investigated the performance of these methods on simulated datasets and characterized parameter settings to reliably detect genes with a differential expression dispersion. We applied these methods to The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets. Interestingly, among the genes with an increased expression dispersion in tumors and without a change in mean expression, we identified some key cellular functions, most of which were related to catabolism and were overrepresented in most of the analyzed cancers. In particular, our results highlight autophagy, whose role in cancerogenesis is context-dependent, illustrating the potential of the differential dispersion approach to gain new insights into biological processes and to discover new biomarkers.Copyright: © 2023 Le Priol et al.

"36911114","Childhood adverse events and BDNF promoter methylation in later-life.","Front Psychiatry","Studies have shown that the effects of early-life stress and trauma can be enduring, with long-term negative effects on health. Epigenetics, including DNA methylation, have been implicated as a potential mechanism for these effects. Brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) is a neurotransmitter involved in learning and memory, and alteredBDNFpromoter methylation measured in peripheral tissue has been found with early-life stress. However, whether such methylation differences remain stable into later life, is unknown. This study aimed to investigate the association between childhood adversity andBDNFpromoter methylation in adults aged 65 years and over. Data came from a large study of older community-dwelling individuals in France (ESPRIT). Information on three major childhood adverse events, namely abuse/maltreatment, war/natural disaster, and financial difficulties/poverty, was obtained by retrospective reporting from participants of ESPRIT study.BDNFpromoter I and IV methylation was assessed in blood and buccal tissue. Linear regression analysis was performed, adjusting for age, sex, education, depression, and morbidity. Among 927 participants, there was no strong evidence that childhood abuse/maltreatment or financial difficulties/poverty were associated withBDNFmethylation in older individuals. For war/natural disaster, differential methylation at four of twenty-nine CpG sites was observed, however, these would not have remained significant after correction for multiple testing. Together, these findings do not support a long-term association between adverse childhood events andBDNFmethylation in older age, but further large prospective studies are needed, which do not target specific genes, but consider DNA methylation across the genome.Copyright © 2023 Zhou, Ancelin, Ritchie and Ryan."
"36874981","PrismEXP: gene annotation prediction from stratified gene-gene co-expression matrices.","PeerJ","Gene-gene co-expression correlations measured by mRNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) can be used to predict gene annotations based on the co-variance structure within these data. In our prior work, we showed that uniformly aligned RNA-seq co-expression data from thousands of diverse studies is highly predictive of both gene annotations and protein-protein interactions. However, the performance of the predictions varies depending on whether the gene annotations and interactions are cell type and tissue specific or agnostic. Tissue and cell type-specific gene-gene co-expression data can be useful for making more accurate predictions because many genes perform their functions in unique ways in different cellular contexts. However, identifying the optimal tissues and cell types to partition the global gene-gene co-expression matrix is challenging.Here we introduce and validate an approach called PRediction of gene Insights from Stratified Mammalian gene co-EXPression (PrismEXP) for improved gene annotation predictions based on RNA-seq gene-gene co-expression data. Using uniformly aligned data from ARCHS4, we apply PrismEXP to predict a wide variety of gene annotations including pathway membership, Gene Ontology terms, as well as human and mouse phenotypes. Predictions made with PrismEXP outperform predictions made with the global cross-tissue co-expression correlation matrix approach on all tested domains, and training using one annotation domain can be used to predict annotations in other domains.By demonstrating the utility of PrismEXP predictions in multiple use cases we show how PrismEXP can be used to enhance unsupervised machine learning methods to better understand the roles of understudied genes and proteins. To make PrismEXP accessible, it is providedviaa user-friendly web interface, a Python package, and an Appyter. AVAILABILITY.

"36909938","Enhancer/gene relationships: Need for more reliable genome-wide reference sets.","Front Bioinform","Differences in cells' functions arise from differential activity of regulatory elements, including enhancers. Enhancers are cis-regulatory elements that cooperate with promoters through transcription factors to activate the expression of one or several genes by getting physically close to them in the 3D space of the nucleus. There is increasing evidence that genetic variants associated with common diseases are enriched in enhancers active in cell types relevant to these diseases. Identifying the enhancers associated with genes and conversely, the sets of genes activated by each enhancer (the so-called enhancer/gene or E/G relationships) across cell types, can help understanding the genetic mechanisms underlying human diseases. There are three broad approaches for the genome-wide identification of E/G relationships in a cell type: 1) genetic link methods or eQTL, 2) functional link methods based on 1D functional data such as open chromatin, histone mark or gene expression and 3) spatial link methods based on 3D data such as HiC. Since 1) and 3) are costly, the current strategy is to develop functional link methods and to use data from 1) and 3) as reference to evaluate them. However, there is still no consensus on the best functional link method to date, and method comparison remain seldom. Here, we compared the relative performances of three recent methods for the identification of enhancer-gene links, TargetFinder, Average-Rank, and the ABC model, using the three latest benchmarks from the field: a reference that combines 3D and eQTL data, called BENGI, and two genetic screening references, called CRiFF and CRiSPRi. Overall, none of the three methods performed best on the three references. CRiFF and CRISPRi reference sets are likely more reliable, but CRiFF is not genome-wide and CRiFF and CRISPRi are mostly available on the K562 cancer cell line. The BENGI reference set is genome-wide but likely contains many false positives. This study therefore calls for new reliable and genome-wide E/G reference data rather than new functional link E/G identification methods.Copyright © 2023 Hoellinger, Mestre, Aschard, Le Goff, Foissac, Faraut and Djebali."
"36899877","Influence of Immune System Abnormalities Caused by Maternal Immune Activation in the Postnatal Period.","Cells","The developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) indicate that fetal tissues and organs in critical and sensitive periods of development are susceptible to structural and functional changes due to the adverse environment in utero. Maternal immune activation (MIA) is one of the phenomena in DOHaD. Exposure to maternal immune activation is a risk factor for neurodevelopmental disorders, psychosis, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic diseases, and human immune disorders. It has been associated with increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines transferred from mother to fetus in the prenatal period. Abnormal immunity induced by MIA includes immune overreaction or immune response failure in offspring. Immune overreaction is a hypersensitivity response of the immune system to pathogens or allergic factor. Immune response failure could not properly fight off various pathogens. The clinical features in offspring depend on the gestation period, inflammatory magnitude, inflammatory type of MIA in the prenatal period, and exposure to prenatal inflammatory stimulation, which might induce epigenetic modifications in the immune system. An analysis of epigenetic modifications caused by adverse intrauterine environments might allow clinicians to predict the onset of diseases and disorders before or after birth."

This study aims to identify the cis-regulatory variants of the genes modulating lung cancer risk among tobacco smokers and altering their chemotherapy responses. From a list of 2984 SNVs, prioritization and functional annotation revealed 22 cis-eQTLs of 14 genes within the gene expression-correlated DNase I hypersensitive sites using lung tissue-specific ENCODE, GTEx, Roadmap Epigenomics, and TCGA datasets. The 22 cis-regulatory variants predictably alter the binding of 44 transcription factors (TFs) expressed in lung tissue. Interestingly, 6 reported lung cancer-associated variants were found in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with 5 prioritized cis-eQTLs from our study. A case-control study with 3 promoter cis-eQTLs (p < 0.01) on 101 lung cancer patients and 401 healthy controls from eastern India with confirmed smoking history revealed an association of rs3764821 (ALDH3B1) (OR = 2.53, 95% CI = 1.57-4.07, p = 0.00014) and rs3748523 (RAD52) (OR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.17-2.47, p = 0.006) with lung cancer risk.

Here, we have harnessed the power of RNA-seq data from hundreds of patients with oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC) or its precursor state Barrett's oesophagus coupled with open chromatin maps to identify potential enhancer RNAs and their associated enhancer regions in this cancer. We identify ~1000 OAC-specific enhancers and use these data to uncover new cellular pathways that are operational in OAC. Among these are enhancers forJUP,MYBL2, andCCNE1, and we show that their activity is required for cancer cell viability. We also demonstrate the clinical utility of our dataset for identifying disease stage and patient prognosis. Our data therefore identify an important set of regulatory elements that enhance our molecular understanding of OAC and point to potential new therapeutic directions.© 2023, Ahmed et al."
"36894604","Sinomenine ameliorates adjuvant-induced arthritis by inhibiting the autophagy/NETosis/inflammation axis.","Sci Rep","Studies have found that neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) which are the specific dying form of neutrophil upon activation have fundamental role in the rheumatoid arthritis onset and progression. The purpose of this study was to explore the therapeutic effect of Sinomenine on adjuvant-induced arthritis in mice, and the neutrophil activities regulated by Sinomenine. The rheumatoid arthritis model was established by local injection of adjuvant and the Sinomenine treatment was administered orally for 30 days, during which, arthritic scores were evaluated and the joint diameter was measured to determine disease progression. The joint tissues and serum were acquired for further tests after sacrifice. Cytometric beads assay was performed to measure the concentration of cytokines. For paraffin-embedded ankle tissues, hematoxylin and erosin staining and Safranin O-fast staining were adopted to monitor the tissue changes of joint. In order to analyze the inflammation, NETs and autophagy of neutrophils in vivo, immunohistochemistry assays were applied to detect the protein expression levels in the local joints. To describe the effect brought by Sinomenine on inflammation, autophagy and NETs in vitro, the western blotting and the immunofluorescence assays were performed. The joint symptoms of the adjuvant induced arthritis were alleviated by the Sinomenine treatment significantly in terms of the ankle diameter and scores. The improvement of local histopathology changes and decrease of inflammatory cytokines in the serum also confirmed the efficacy. The expression levels of interleukin-6, P65 and p-P65 in the ankle areas of mice were remarkably reduced by Sinomenine. Compared with the model group, the decreased expression levels of lymphocyte antigen 6 complex and myeloperoxidase in the Sinomenine treating group showed the inhibitory effect of Sinomenine on the neutrophil migration. The expression of protein arginine deiminase type 4 (PAD4), ctrullinated histone H3 (CitH3) and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B (LC3B) had the similar tendency. Upon activation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vitro, Sinomenine suppressed the phosphorylation of P65, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and P38 of neutrophil. Meanwhile, Sinomenine inhibited NETs formation induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), which were demonstrated by the decreased expression of neutrophil elastase (NE), PAD4 and CitH3. Sinomenine also inhibited PMA-induced autophagy in vitro based on the changes of Beclin-1 and LC3B. Sinomenine has good efficacy in treating adjuvant induced arthritis via regulating neutrophil activities. Apart from inhibiting activation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, the mechanism includes suppression of NETs formation via autophagy inhibition.© 2023.

Fatigue, arthralgia and myalgia are also common symptoms, whereas extraglandular manifestations that involve the respiratory, nervous and vascular systems occur in a subset of patients. The disease predominantly affects women, with an estimated female to male ratio of 14 to 1. The aetiology of pSS, however, remains incompletely understood, and effective treatment is lacking. Large-scale genetic and epigenetic investigations have revealed associations between pSS and genes in both innate and adaptive immune pathways. The genetic variants mediate context-dependent effects, and both sex and environmental factors can influence the outcome. As such, genetic and epigenetic studies can provide insight into the dysregulated molecular mechanisms, which in turn might reveal new therapeutic possibilities. This Review discusses the genetic and epigenetic features that have been robustly connected with pSS, putting them into the context of cellular function, carrier sex and environmental challenges. In all, the observations point to several novel opportunities for early detection, treatment development and the pathway towards personalized medicine.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."

However, it is unclear whether epidermal keratinocytes are involved in disease recurrence. There is increasing evidence regarding the importance of epigenetic mechanisms in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Nonetheless, the epigenetic changes that contribute to the recurrence of psoriasis remain unknown. The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of keratinocytes in psoriasis relapse. The epigenetic marks 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) were visualized using immunofluorescence staining, and RNA sequencing was performed on paired never-lesional and resolved epidermal and dermal compartments of skin from psoriasis patients. We observed diminished 5-mC and 5-hmC amounts and decreased mRNA expression of the ten-eleven translocation (TET) 3 enzyme in the resolved epidermis. SAMHD1, C10orf99, and AKR1B10: the highly dysregulated genes in resolved epidermis are known to be associated with pathogenesis of psoriasis, and the DRTP was enriched in WNT, TNF, and mTOR signaling pathways. Our results suggest that epigenetic changes detected in epidermal keratinocytes of resolved skin may be responsible for the DRTP in the same regions. Thus, the DRTP of keratinocytes may contribute to site-specific local relapse."

We aimed to examine the dose-response association of maternal smoking during each of the three trimesters of pregnancy with all-cause and cause-specific infant death.In this nationwide, population-based, retrospective cohort study, data were extracted from the U.S. National Vital Statistics System, 2015-2019. We included mother-infant pairs after excluding twin or multiple births, newborns with gestation age <37 weeks and those with low birthweight, mothers aged <18 years or ≥50 years, mothers with pre-existing hypertension or diabetes, and those with missing values for variables of interest. Poisson regression models were used to examine the association of different intensities and doses of maternal smoking during each of the three trimesters of pregnancy with all-cause and cause-specific infant death attributed to congenital anomalies, preterm birth, other perinatal conditions, sudden unexpected infant death, and infection.A total of 13,524,204 mother-infant pairs were included in our analyses. Maternal smoking during the entire pregnancy was associated with infant all-cause death (relative risk [RR] 1.88, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.79-1.97), cause-specific death due to preterm birth (1.57, 1.25-1.98), perinatal conditions excluding preterm birth (1.35, 1.10-1.65), sudden unexpected infant death (2.56, 2.40-2.73), and infection (1.51, 1.20-1.88).

Compared with mothers who smoked during their entire pregnancy, those who smoked in the first trimester and then quit smoking in the second or third trimesters of pregnancy had a reduced risk of infant all-cause death (0.71, 0.65-0.78) and sudden unexpected infant death (0.64, 0.57-0.72).There was a dose-response association of maternal cigarette use during each of the three trimesters of pregnancy with all-cause and cause-specific infant death. In addition, mothers who are smokers in the first trimester and then quit smoking in the subsequent two trimesters are at decreased risk of infant all-cause mortality and sudden unexpected infant death compared with those who smoked during the entire pregnancy. These findings suggest that there is no safe level of maternal smoking in any trimester of pregnancy and maternal smokers should stop smoking during pregnancy to improve the survival of infants.Youth Team of Humanistic and Social Science and the Innovation Team of the ""Climbing"" Program of Shandong University (20820IFYT1902).© 2023 The Author(s)."
"36901763","Involvement of lncRNA TUG1 in HIV-1 Tat-Induced Astrocyte Senescence.","Int J Mol Sci","HIV-1 infection in the era of combined antiretroviral therapy has been associated with premature aging. Among the various features of HIV-1 associated neurocognitive disorders, astrocyte senescence has been surmised as a potential cause contributing to HIV-1-induced brain aging and neurocognitive impairments. Recently, lncRNAs have also been implicated to play essential roles in the onset of cellular senescence. Herein, using human primary astrocytes (HPAs), we investigated the role of lncRNA TUG1 in HIV-1 Tat-mediated onset of astrocyte senescence. We found that HPAs exposed to HIV-1 Tat resulted in significant upregulation of lncRNA TUG1 expression that was accompanied by elevated expression of p16 and p21, respectively. Additionally, HIV-1 Tat-exposed HPAs demonstrated increased expression of senescence-associated (SA) markers-SA-β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity and SA-heterochromatin foci-cell-cycle arrest, and increased production of reactive oxygen species and proinflammatory cytokines. Intriguingly, gene silencing of lncRNA TUG1 in HPAs also reversed HIV-1 Tat-induced upregulation of p21, p16, SA-β gal activity, cellular activation, and proinflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, increased expression of astrocytic p16 and p21, lncRNA TUG1, and proinflammatory cytokines were observed in the prefrontal cortices of HIV-1 transgenic rats, thereby suggesting the occurrence of senescence activation in vivo. Overall, our data indicate that HIV-1 Tat-induced astrocyte senescence involves the lncRNA TUG1 and could serve as a potential therapeutic target for dampening accelerated aging associated with HIV-1/HIV-1 proteins."
"36901776","Outdoor Air Pollution and Childhood Respiratory Disease: The Role of Oxidative Stress.","Int J Mol Sci","The leading mechanisms through which air pollutants exert their damaging effects are the promotion of oxidative stress, the induction of an inflammatory response, and the deregulation of the immune system by reducing its ability to limit infectious agents' spreading. This influence starts in the prenatal age and continues during childhood, the most susceptible period of life, due to a lower efficiency of oxidative damage detoxification, a higher metabolic and breathing rate, and enhanced oxygen consumption per unit of body mass. Air pollution is involved in acute disorders like asthma exacerbations and upper and lower respiratory infections, including bronchiolitis, tuberculosis, and pneumoniae. Pollutants can also contribute to the onset of chronic asthma, and they can lead to a deficit in lung function and growth, long-term respiratory damage, and eventually chronic respiratory illness. Air pollution abatement policies, applied in the last decades, are contributing to mitigating air quality issues, but more efforts should be encouraged to improve acute childhood respiratory disease with possible positive long-term effects on lung function. This narrative review aims to summarize the most recent studies on the links between air pollution and childhood respiratory illness."

Its clinical presentation, including the nature and severity of organ involvement, is highly variable and unpredictable and is not as strongly linked to genotype and environmental exposure (e.g., smoking history) as might be expected. Significant differences were observed within matched populations of severe AATD patients regarding risk of complications, age at onset, and disease course, including the dynamics of lung function decline.

However, the mechanisms underlying cancer metastasis are far from clear.We screened candidate genes related to metastasis through genome-wide CRISPR screening and high-throughput sequencing of patients with metastatic BC, followed by a panel of metastatic model assays. The effects of tetratricopeptide repeat domain 17 (TTC17) on migration, invasion, and colony formation ability together with the responses to anticancer drugs were investigated in vitro and in vivo. The mechanism mediated by TTC17 was determined by RNA sequencing, Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence. The clinical significance of TTC17 was evaluated using BC tissue samples combined with clinicopathological data.We identified the loss of TTC17 as a metastasis driver in BC, and its expression was negatively correlated with malignancy and positively correlated with patient prognosis. TTC17 loss in BC cells promoted their migration, invasion, and colony formation capacity in vitro and lung metastasis in vivo. Conversely, overexpressing TTC17 suppressed these aggressive phenotypes. Mechanistically, TTC17 knockdown in BC cells resulted in the activation of the RAP1/CDC42 pathway along with a disordered cytoskeleton in BC cells, and pharmacological blockade of CDC42 abolished the potentiation of motility and invasiveness caused by TTC17 silencing. Research on BC specimens demonstrated reduced TTC17 and increased CDC42 in metastatic tumors and lymph nodes, and low TTC17 expression was linked to more aggressive clinicopathologic characteristics. Through screening the anticancer drug library, the CDC42 inhibitor rapamycin and the microtubule-stabilizing drug paclitaxel showed stronger inhibition of TTC17-silenced BC cells, which was confirmed by more favorable efficacy in BC patients and tumor-bearing mice receiving rapamycin or paclitaxel in the TTC17Lowarm.TTC17 loss is a novel factor promoting BC metastasis, that enhances migration and invasion by activating RAP1/CDC42 signaling and sensitizes BC to rapamycin and paclitaxel, which may improve stratified treatment strategies under the concept of molecular phenotyping-based precision therapy of BC.© 2023.

It has been reported that innate immune system cells can assume a persistent proinflammatory state after short stimulation with endogenous atherogenic stimuli. The pathogenesis of AS can be influenced by this persistent hyperactivation of the innate immune system, which is termed trained immunity. Trained immunity has also been implicated as a key pathological mechanism, leading to persistent chronic inflammation in AS. Trained immunity is mediatedviaepigenetic and metabolic reprogramming and occurs in mature innate immune cells and their bone marrow progenitors. Natural products are promising candidates for novel pharmacological agents that can be used to prevent or treat cardiovascular diseases (CVD). A variety of natural products and agents exhibiting antiatherosclerotic abilities have been reported to potentially interfere with the pharmacological targets of trained immunity.

To preliminarily explore whether adolescent MDD has unique mechanisms compared with adult MDD.We compared DNA methylation and mRNA profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from four first-episode and drug-naive adolescents with MDD and five healthy adolescent controls (HCs). We performed differential expression analysis, constructed co-expression network, and screened the hub genes. And enrichment analysis was performed based on Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). We also downloaded DNA methylation and mRNA datasets of adults with MDD (GSE113725/GSE38206) from the GEO database, and performed differential expression and enrichment analysis.Our clinical data showed that 3034 methylation sites and 4190 mRNAs were differentially expressed in first-episode, drug-naive adolescents MDD patients compared with HCs. 19 hub genes were screened out according to the high degree value in the co-expression network. The results from the GEO database showed that compared with adult HCs, there were 290 methylation sites and 127 mRNAs were differentially expressed in adult MDD patients.Compared with adolescent HCs and adult MDD patients, the DNA methylation and mRNA expression patterns of first-episode, drug-naive adolescent MDD patients were different. The co-expression network of DNA methylation and mRNA and the screened hub genes may play an important role in the pathogenesis of MDD in first-episode, drug-naive adolescents.

"36906648","Short-term molecular consequences of chromosome mis-segregation for genome stability.","Nat Commun","Chromosome instability (CIN) is the most common form of genome instability and is a hallmark of cancer. CIN invariably leads to aneuploidy, a state of karyotype imbalance. Here, we show that aneuploidy can also trigger CIN. We found that aneuploid cells experience DNA replication stress in their first S-phase and precipitate in a state of continuous CIN. This generates a repertoire of genetically diverse cells with structural chromosomal abnormalities that can either continue proliferating or stop dividing. Cycling aneuploid cells display lower karyotype complexity compared to the arrested ones and increased expression of DNA repair signatures. Interestingly, the same signatures are upregulated in highly-proliferative cancer cells, which might enable them to proliferate despite the disadvantage conferred by aneuploidy-induced CIN. Altogether, our study reveals the short-term origins of CIN following aneuploidy and indicates the aneuploid state of cancer cells as a point mutation-independent source of genome instability, providing an explanation for aneuploidy occurrence in tumors.© 2023.

Somatic mutations in the RNase IIIb domain of DICER1 impair its ability to generate mature 5p miRNAs and are believed to drive tumorigenesis in DICER1 syndrome-associated and sporadic thyroid tumors. However, theDICER1-driven specific changes in miRNAs and resulting changes in gene expression are poorly understood in thyroid tissue. In this study, we profiled the miRNA (n=2,083) and mRNA (n=2,559) transcriptomes of 20 non-neoplastic, 8 adenomatous and 60 pediatric thyroid cancers (13 follicular thyroid cancers [FTC] and 47 papillary thyroid cancers [PTC]) of which 8 hadDICER1RNase IIIb mutations. AllDICER1-mutant differentiated thyroid cancers (DTC) were follicular patterned (six follicular variant PTC and two FTC), none had lymph node metastasis. We demonstrate thatDICER1pathogenic somatic mutations were associated with a global reduction of 5p-derived miRNAs, including those particularly abundant in the non-neoplastic thyroid tissue such as let-7 and mir-30 families, known for their tumor suppressor function. There was also an unexpected increase of 3p miRNAs, possibly associated withDICER1mRNA expression increase in tumors harboring RNase IIIb mutations. These abnormally expressed 3p miRNAs, which are otherwise low or absent inDICER1-wt DTC and non-neoplastic thyroid tissues, make up exceptional markers for malignant thyroid tumors harboringDICER1RNase IIIb mutations. The extensive disarray in the miRNA transcriptome results in gene expression changes, which were indicative of positive regulation of cell-cycle. Moreover, differentially expressed genes point to increased MAPK signaling output and loss of thyroid differentiation comparable to the RAS-like subgroup of PTC (as coined by The Cancer Genome Atlas), which is reflective of the more indolent clinical behavior of these tumors.Copyright © 2023 Ricarte-Filho, Casado-Medrano, Reichenberger, Spangler, Scheerer, Isaza, Baran, Patel, MacFarland, Brodeur, Stewart, Baloch, Bauer, Wasserman and Franco."

Despite an improved understanding of anti-cancer immune responses in the TME, it is still unclear how immuno-suppressive TME are formed and how some cancer cells survive and metastasize.To identify the major adaptations that cancer cells undergo during tumor development and progression, we compared the transcriptome and proteome from metastatic 66cl4 and non-metastatic 67NR cell lines in culture versus their corresponding mouse mammary primary tumors. Using confocal microscopy, RT-qPCR, flow cytometry and western blotting, we studied the signaling pathway and the mechanisms involved. In addition, we used public gene expression data from human breast cancer biopsies to evaluate the correlation between gene expression and clinical outcomes in patients.We found that type I interferon (IFN-I) response was a key differentially regulated pathway between metastatic and non-metastatic cell lines and tumors. The IFN-I response was active in metastatic cancer cells in culture and markedly dampened when these cells formed primary tumors. Interestingly, the opposite was observed in non-metastatic cancer cells and tumors. Consistent with an active IFN-I response in culture, the metastatic cancer cells displayed elevated levels of cytosolic DNA from both mitochondria and ruptured micronuclei with concomitant activation of cGAS-STING signaling. Interestingly, decreased IFN-I-related gene expression in breast cancer biopsies correlated with an unfavourable prognosis in patients.Our findings show that IFN-I response is dampened in the tumors with the metastatic ability and lower IFN-I expression predicts poor prognosis in triple-negative and HER2 enriched breast cancer patients. This study highlights the possibility of reactivating the IFN-I response as a potential therapeutic strategy in breast cancer. Video Abstract.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36880649","Targeting the fatty acid binding proteins disrupts multiple myeloma cell cycle progression and MYC signalin.","Elife","Multiple myeloma is an incurable plasma cell malignancy with only a 53% 5-year survival rate. There is a critical need to find new multiple myeloma vulnerabilities and therapeutic avenues. Herein, we identified and explored a novel multiple myeloma target: the fatty acid binding protein (FABP) family. In our work, myeloma cells were treated with FABP inhibitors (BMS3094013 and SBFI-26) and examined in vivo and in vitro for cell cycle state, proliferation, apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential, cellular metabolism (oxygen consumption rates and fatty acid oxidation), and DNA methylation properties. Myeloma cell responses to BMS309403, SBFI-26, or both, were also assessed with RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and proteomic analysis, and confirmed with western blotting and qRT-PCR. Myeloma cell dependency on FABPs was assessed using the Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap). Finally, MM patient datasets (CoMMpass and GEO) were mined forFABPexpression correlations with clinical outcomes. We found that myeloma cells treated with FABPi or withFABP5knockout (generated via CRISPR/Cas9 editing) exhibited diminished proliferation, increased apoptosis, and metabolic changes in vitro. FABPi had mixed results in vivo, in two pre-clinical MM mouse models, suggesting optimization of in vivo delivery, dosing, or type of FABP inhibitors will be needed before clinical applicability. FABPi negatively impacted mitochondrial respiration and reduced expression of MYC and other key signaling pathways in MM cells in vitro. Clinical data demonstrated worse overall and progression-free survival in patients with highFABP5expression in tumor cells. Overall, this study establishes the FABP family as a potentially new target in multiple myeloma. In MM cells, FABPs have a multitude of actions and cellular roles that result in the support of myeloma progression. Further research into the FABP family in MM is warrented, especially into the effective translation of targeting these in vivo.© 2023, Farrell et al."

Unraveling their function is complicated by the overlapping association of ARFs with guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), and numerous interactors. Through a functional genomic screen of three-dimensional (3D) prostate cancer cell behavior, we explore the contribution of ARF GTPases, GEFs, GAPs, and interactors to collective invasion. This revealed that ARF3 GTPase regulates the modality of invasion, acting as a switch between leader cell-led chains of invasion or collective sheet movement. Functionally, the ability of ARF3 to control invasion modality is dependent on association and subsequent control of turnover of N-cadherin. In vivo, ARF3 levels acted as a rheostat for metastasis from intraprostatic tumor transplants and ARF3/N-cadherin expression can be used to identify prostate cancer patients with metastatic, poor-outcome disease. Our analysis defines a unique function for the ARF3 GTPase in controlling how cells collectively organize during invasion and metastasis.© 2023 Sandilands et al."

Due to its complex pathogenesis, current diagnostic and therapeutic effects remain unsatisfactory. Studies have shown that KLF2, as a tumor suppressor, is downregulated in many human cancers, but its relationship and role with GC remain unclear. In the present study, KLF2 mRNA levels were significantly lower in GC compared to adjacent normal tissues, as analyzed by bioinformatics and RT-qPCR, and correlated with gene mutations. Tissue microarrays combined with immunohistochemical techniques showed downregulation of KLF2 protein expression in GC tissue, which was negatively correlated with patient age, T stage, and overall survival. Further functional experiments showed that knockdown of KLF2 significantly promoted the growth, proliferation, migration, and invasion of HGC-27 and AGS GC cells. In conclusion, low KLF2 expression in GC is associated with poor patient prognosis and contributes to the malignant biological behavior of GC cells. Therefore, KLF2 may serve as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in GC.Copyright © 2023 Xi-mei Li et al."

However, it remains unclear whether cuproptosis plays a role in LUAD prognosis.Methods:Dataset of the TCGA-LUAD was treated as training cohort, while validation cohort consisted of the merged datasets of the GSE29013, GSE30219, GSE31210, GSE37745, and GSE50081. Ten studied cuproptosis-related genes (CRG) were used to generated CRG clusters and CRG cluster-related differential expressed gene (CRG-DEG) clusters. The differently expressed lncRNA that with prognosis ability between the CRG-DEG clusters were put into a LASSO regression for cuproptosis-related lncRNA signature (CRLncSig). Kaplan-Meier estimator, Cox model, receiver operating characteristic (ROC), time-dependent AUC (tAUC), principal component analysis (PCA), and nomogram predictor were further deployed to confirm the model's accuracy. We examined the model's connections with other forms of regulated cell death, including apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, and ferroptosis. The immunotherapy ability of the signature was demonstrated by applying eight mainstream immunoinformatic algorithms, TMB, TIDE, and immune checkpoints. We evaluated the potential drugs for high risk CRLncSig LUADs. Real-time PCR in human LUAD tissues were performed to verify the CRLncSig expression pattern, and the signature's pan-cancer's ability was also assessed.Results:A nine-lncRNA signature, CRLncSig, was built and demonstrated owning prognostic power by applied to the validation cohort. Each of the signature genes was confirmed differentially expressed in the real world by real-time PCR. The CRLncSig correlated with 2,469/3,681 (67.07%) apoptosis-related genes, 13/20 (65.00%) necroptosis-related genes, 35/50 (70.00%) pyroptosis-related genes, and 238/380 (62.63%) ferroptosis-related genes. Immunotherapy analysis suggested that CRLncSig correlated with immune status, and checkpoints, KIR2DL3, IL10, IL2, CD40LG, SELP, BTLA, and CD28, were linked closely to our signature and were potentially suitable for LUAD immunotherapy targets. For those high-risk patients, we found three agents, gemcitabine, daunorubicin, and nobiletin. Finally, we found some of the CRLncSig lncRNAs potentially play a vital role in some types of cancer and need more attention in further studies.Conclusion:The results of this study suggest our cuproptosis-related CRLncSig can help to determine the outcome of LUAD and the effectiveness of immunotherapy, as well as help to better select targets and therapeutic agents.Copyright © 2023 Ma, Li, He, Zhao, Yang and Gu."
"36841242","NRF2 activation induces NADH-reductive stress, providing a metabolic vulnerability in lung cancer.","Cell Metab","Multiple cancers regulate oxidative stress by activating the transcription factor NRF2 through mutation of its negative regulator, KEAP1. NRF2 has been studied extensively in KEAP1-mutant cancers; however, the role of this pathway in cancers with wild-type KEAP1 remains poorly understood. To answer this question, we induced NRF2 via pharmacological inactivation of KEAP1 in a panel of 50+ non-small cell lung cancer cell lines. Unexpectedly, marked decreases in viability were observed in >13% of the cell lines-an effect that was rescued by NRF2 ablation. Genome-wide and targeted CRISPR screens revealed that NRF2 induces NADH-reductive stress, through the upregulation of the NAD+-consuming enzyme ALDH3A1. Leveraging these findings, we show that cells treated with KEAP1 inhibitors or those with endogenous KEAP1 mutations are selectively vulnerable to Complex I inhibition, which impairs NADH oxidation capacity and potentiates reductive stress. Thus, we identify reductive stress as a metabolic vulnerability in NRF2-activated lung cancers.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

We investigated their association with human aging in two ways. First, we quantified Numts in 1,187 post-mortem brain and blood samples. Human brains exhibited a 5.5-fold enrichment of somatic Numt insertions in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex compared to the cerebellum, suggesting that they arose spontaneously during development or with aging. Moreover, more brain Numts was linked to earlier mortality. The brains of individuals with no cognitive impairment who died at younger ages carried approximately 2 more Numts per decade of life lost than those who lived longer. Second, we tested the dynamic transfer of Numts in a repeated-measures WGS study in a human fibroblast model that recapitulates several molecular features of human aging. These longitudinal experiments revealed a gradual accumulation of one Numt every ~9 days, independent of large-scale genomic instability. Targeted genetic and pharmacological perturbations of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation did not affect numtogenesis, whereas chronic glucocorticoid stress increased the Numts transfer rate by 39.8%. Combined, our data document spontaneous numtogenesis in aging human cells and demonstrate an association between brain cortical somatic Numts and human lifespan."

"36865159","Bed Nucleus of the Stria Terminalis GABA neurons are necessary for changes in foraging behavior following an innate threat.","bioRxiv","Foraging is a universal behavior that has co-evolved with predation pressure. We investigated the role of bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) GABA neurons in robotic and live predator threat processing and their consequences in post-threat encounter foraging. Mice were trained to procure food in a laboratory-based foraging apparatus in which food pellets were placed at discrete and incrementally greater distances from a nest zone. After mice learned to forage, they were exposed to either a robotic or live predator threat, while BNST GABA neurons were chemogenetically inhibited. Post-robotic threat encounter, mice spent more time in the nest zone, but other foraging parameters were unchanged compared to pre-encounter behavior. Inhibition of BNST GABA neurons had no effect on foraging behavior post-robotic threat encounter. Following live predator exposure, control mice spent significantly more time in the nest zone, increased their latency to successfully forage, and their overall foraging performance was significantly a ltered. I nhibition o f BNST GABA neurons during live predator exposure prevented changes in foraging behavior from developing after live predator threat. BNST GABA neuron inhibition did not alter foraging behavior during robotic or live predator threat. We conclude that while both robotic and live predator encounter effectively intrude on foraging behavior, the perceived risk and behavioral consequence of the threats are distinguishable.

This study aims to explore the pan-cancerous picture of the expression of BRIP1 across 33 human cancers.Based on the data from TCGA and GTEx, a series of bioinformatic analyses were applied to systematically explore the genetic landscape and biologic function of BRIP1 in 33 human tumors.We observed prognosis-related differential BRIP1 expressions between various carcinomas and the corresponding normal tissues. ""Basal transcription factors,"" ""homologous recombination,"" ""nucleotide excision repair,"" and DNA metabolism pathways may play a role in the functional mechanisms of BRIP1. Patients with uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma presented with the highest alteration frequency of BRIP1 (nearly 10%). Single-nucleotide and copy number variations of BRIP1 were noticed in multiple cancers, and the expression of BRIP1 is significantly regulated by copy number variation in breast invasive carcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma. BRIP1 expression is negatively correlated with the DNA methylation levels in many tumors and is associated with the activation of apoptosis, cell cycle, DNA damage response, and inhibition of hormone ER and RNS/MARK signaling pathways. Moreover, a positive correlation was observed between BRIP1 expression and the immune infiltration levels of cancer-associated fibroblasts and CD8+ T cells in lung adenocarcinoma.Our pan-cancer analysis of BRIP1 provides a valuable resource for understanding the multimolecular characteristics and biological function of BRIP1 across human cancers.© 2023.

After competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) hypothesis was proposed, this triple regulatory network has been observed in various cancers, and increasing evidences reveal that ceRNA network plays a significant role in the migration, invasion, proliferation of cancer cells. In the current study, our target is to construct a CD24-associated ceRNA network, and to further identify key prognostic biomarkers in breast cancer. Using the transcriptom profiles from TCGA database, we performed a comprehensive analysis between CD24hightumor samples and CD24lowtumor samples, and identified 132 DElncRNAs, 602 DEmRNAs and 26 DEmiRNAs. Through comprehensive analysis, RP1-228H13.5/miR-135a-5p/BEND3 and SIM2 were identified as key CD24-associated biomarkers, which exhibited highly significance with overall survival, immune microenvironment as well as clinical features. To sum up the above, the current study constructed a CD24-associated ceRNA network, and RP1-228H13.5/miR-135a-5p/BEND3 and SIM2 axis worked as a potential therapeutic target and a predictor for BRCA diagnosis and prognosis.© 2023.

"36901967","Epigenetic Abnormalities in Chondrosarcoma.","Int J Mol Sci","In recent years, our understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms involved in tumor pathology has improved greatly. DNA and histone modifications, such as methylation, demethylation, acetylation, and deacetylation, can lead to the up-regulation of oncogenic genes, as well as the suppression of tumor suppressor genes. Gene expression can also be modified on a post-transcriptional level by microRNAs that contribute to carcinogenesis. The role of these modifications has been already described in many tumors, e.g., colorectal, breast, and prostate cancers. These mechanisms have also begun to be investigated in less common tumors, such as sarcomas. Chondrosarcoma (CS) is a rare type of tumor that belongs to sarcomas and is the second most common malignant bone tumor after osteosarcoma. Due to unknown pathogenesis and resistance to chemo- and radiotherapies of these tumors, there is a need to develop new potential therapies against CS. In this review, we summarize current knowledge on the influence of epigenetic alterations in the pathogenesis of CS by discussing potential candidates for future therapies. We also emphasize ongoing clinical trials that use drugs targeting epigenetic modifications in CS treatment."

Over the past few decades, few drugs have been identified for treating Alzheimer's disease (AD), especially for impacting the causes of cell death in AD. Although drug repurposing is gaining more success in developing therapeutic efficacy for complex diseases such as common cancer, the complications behind AD require further study. Here, we developed a novel prediction framework based on deep learning to identify potential repurposed drug therapies for AD, and more importantly, our framework is broadly applicable and may generalize to identifying potential drug combinations in other diseases. Our prediction framework is as follows: we first built a drug-target pair (DTP) network based on multiple drug features and target features, as well as the associations between DTP nodes where drug-target pairs are the DTP nodes and the associations between DTP nodes are represented as the edges in the AD disease network; furthermore, we incorporated the drug-target feature from the DTP network and the relationship information between drug-drug, target-target, drug-target within and outside of drug-target pairs, representing each drug-combination as a quartet to generate corresponding integrated features; finally, we developed an AI-based Drug discovery Network (AI-DrugNet), which exhibits robust predictive performance. The implementation of our network model help identify potential repurposed and combination drug options that may serve to treat AD and other diseases.© 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Research Network of Computational and Structural Biotechnology."

However, large co-expression networks are difficult to interpret and do not guarantee that the relations found will be true for different genotypes. Statistically verified time expression profiles give information about significant changes in expressions through time, and genes with highly correlated time expression profiles, which are annotated in the same biological process, are likely to be functionally connected. A method to obtain robust networks of functionally related genes will be useful to understand the complexity of the transcriptome, leading to biologically relevant insights. We present an algorithm to construct gene functional networks for genes annotated in a given biological process or other aspects of interest. We assume that there are genome-wide time expression profiles for a set of representative genotypes of the species of interest. The method is based on the correlation of time expression profiles, bound by a set of thresholds that assure both, a given false discovery rate, and the discard of correlation outliers. The novelty of the method consists in that a gene expression relation must be repeatedly found in a given set of independent genotypes to be considered valid. This automatically discards relations particular to specific genotypes, assuring a network robustness, which can be set a priori. Additionally, we present an algorithm to find transcription factors candidates for regulating hub genes within a network. The algorithms are demonstrated with data from a large experiment studying gene expression during the development of the fruit in a diverse set of chili pepper genotypes.

Single-cell techniques were conducted to validate the DDR levels and intercellular communications in cognitively impaired patients. The consensus clustering algorithm was utilized to group 167 AD patients into diverse subgroups after a WGCNA approach was employed to discover DDR-related lncRNAs. The distinctions between the categories in terms of clinical characteristics, DDR levels, biological behaviors, and immunological characteristics were evaluated. For the purpose of choosing distinctive lncRNAs associated with DDR, four machine learning algorithms, including LASSO, SVM-RFE, RF, and XGBoost, were utilized. A risk model was established based on the characteristic lncRNAs.The progression of AD was highly correlated with DDR levels. Single-cell studies confirmed that DDR activity was lower in cognitively impaired patients and was mainly enriched in T cells and B cells. DDR-related lncRNAs were discovered based on gene expression, and two different heterogeneous subtypes (C1 and C2) were identified. DDR C1 belonged to the non-immune phenotype, while DDR C2 was regarded as the immune phenotype. Based on various machine learning techniques, four distinctive lncRNAs associated with DDR, including FBXO30-DT, TBX2-AS1, ADAMTS9-AS2, and MEG3 were discovered. The 4-lncRNA based riskScore demonstrated acceptable efficacy in the diagnosis of AD and offered significant clinical advantages to AD patients. The riskScore ultimately divided AD patients into low- and high-risk categories. In comparison to the low-risk group, high-risk patients showed lower DDR activity, accompanied by higher levels of immune infiltration and immunological score. The prospective medications for the treatment of AD patients with low and high risk also included arachidonyltrifluoromethane and TTNPB, respectively.In conclusion, immunological microenvironment and disease progression in AD patients were significantly predicted by DDR-associated genes and lncRNAs. A theoretical underpinning for the individualized treatment of AD patients was provided by the suggested genetic subtypes and risk model based on DDR.Copyright © 2023 Lai, Lin, Chen, Lin, Wu, Zhao, Lin and Lin."
"36894886","Development and validation of a coagulation-related genes prognostic model for hepatocellular carcinoma.","BMC Bioinformatics","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a high incidence and mortality worldwide, which seriously threatens people's physical and mental health. Coagulation is closely related to the occurrence and development of HCC. Whether coagulation-related genes (CRGs) can be used as prognostic markers for HCC remains to be investigated.Firstly, we identified differentially expressed coagulation-related genes of HCC and control samples in the datasets GSE54236, GSE102079, TCGA-LIHC, and Genecards database. Then, univariate Cox regression analysis, LASSO regression analysis, and multivariate Cox regression analysis were used to determine the key CRGs and establish the coagulation-related risk score (CRRS) prognostic model in the TCGA-LIHC dataset. The predictive capability of the CRRS model was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and ROC analysis. External validation was performed in the ICGC-LIRI-JP dataset. Besides, combining risk score and age, gender, grade, and stage, a nomogram was constructed to quantify the survival probability. We further analyzed the correlation between risk score and functional enrichment, pathway, and tumor immune microenvironment.We identified 5 key CRGs (FLVCR1, CENPE, LCAT, CYP2C9, and NQO1) and constructed the CRRS prognostic model. The overall survival (OS) of the high-risk group was shorter than that of the low-risk group. The AUC values for 1 -, 3 -, and 5-year OS in the TCGA dataset were 0.769, 0.691, and 0.674, respectively. The Cox analysis showed that CRRS was an independent prognostic factor for HCC. A nomogram established with risk score, age, gender, grade, and stage, has a better prognostic value for HCC patients. In the high-risk group, CD4+T cells memory resting, NK cells activated, and B cells naive were significantly lower. The expression levels of immune checkpoint genes in the high-risk group were generally higher than that in the low-risk group.The CRRS model has reliable predictive value for the prognosis of HCC patients.© 2023.

However, the function of LINC00659 in lower extremity DVT (LEDVT) remains to be largely unrevealed. A total of 30 inferior vena cava (IVC) tissue samples and peripheral blood (60 ml per subject) were obtained from LEDVT patients (n = 15) and healthy donors (n = 15), and then LINC00659 expression was detected by RT-qPCR. The results displayed that LINC00659 is upregulated in IVC tissues and isolated endothelial group cells (EPCs) of patients with LEDVT. LINC00659 knock-down promoted the proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis ability of EPCs, while an pcDNA-eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A3 (EIF4A3), a EIF4A3 overexpression vector, or fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) small interfering RNA (siRNA) combined with LINC00659 siRNA could not enhance this effect. Mechanistically, LINC00659 bound with EIF4A3 promoter to upregulated EIF4A3 expression. Besides, EIF4A3 could facilitate FGF1 methylation and its downregulated expression by recruiting DNA methyltransferases 3A (DNMT3A) to the FGF1 promoter region. Additionally, LINC00659 inhibition could alleviate LEDVT in mice. In summary, the data indicated the roles of LINC00659 in the pathogenesis of LEDVT, and the LINC00659/EIF4A3/FGF1 axis could be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of LEDVT.© 2023.

"36824816","NSD1 deposits histone H3 lysine 36 dimethylation to pattern non-CG DNA methylation in neurons.","bioRxiv","During postnatal development the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A deposits high levels of non-CG cytosine methylation in neurons. This unique methylation is critical for transcriptional regulation in the mature mammalian brain, and loss of this mark is implicated in DNMT3A-associated neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). The mechanisms determining genomic non-CG methylation profiles are not well defined however, and it is unknown if this pathway is disrupted in additional NDDs. Here we show that genome topology and gene expression converge to shape histone H3 lysine 36 dimethylation (H3K36me2) profiles, which in turn recruit DNMT3A and pattern neuronal non-CG methylation. We show that NSD1, the H3K36 methyltransferase mutated in the NDD, Sotos syndrome, is required for megabase-scale patterning of H3K36me2 and non-CG methylation in neurons. We find that brain-specific deletion of NSD1 causes alterations in DNA methylation that overlap with models of DNMT3A disorders and define convergent disruption in the expression of key neuronal genes in these models that may contribute to shared phenotypes in NSD1- and DNMT3A-associated NDD. Our findings indicate that H3K36me2 deposited by NSD1 is an important determinant of neuronal non-CG DNA methylation and implicates disruption of this methylation in Sotos syndrome.Topology-associated DNA methylation and gene expression independently contribute to neuronal gene body and enhancer non-CG DNA methylation patterns.Topology-associated H3K36me2 patterns and local enrichment of H3K4 methylation impact deposition of non-CG methylation by DNMT3A.

Clinical phenotypes were identified using latent class analysis. Bivariate logistic regression examined epigenetic age, cardiometabolic traits (i.e., body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m 2 , hypertension, or diabetes), and psychosocial variables as predictors of class membership.All participants were Black/AA and predominantly non-Hispanic. Over half of the sample had one or more cardiometabolic traits. Two latent classes were identified (low vs. moderate depressive symptoms). Somatic and self-critical symptoms characterized the moderate symptom class. Higher stress overload scores significantly predicted moderate-symptom class membership.In this sample of AA women with increased cardiometabolic burden, increased stress was associated with depressive symptoms that standard screening tools may not capture. Research examining the effect of specific stressors and the efficacy of tools to identify at-risk AA women are urgently needed to address disparities and mental health burdens.Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"36901717","Updating the Clinical Application of Blood Biomarkers and Their Algorithms in the Diagnosis and Surveillance of Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Critical Review.","Int J Mol Sci","The most common primary liver cancer is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and its mortality rate is increasing globally. The overall 5-year survival of patients with liver cancer is currently 10-20%. Moreover, because early diagnosis can significantly improve prognosis, which is highly correlated with tumor stage, early detection of HCC is critical. International guidelines advise using α-FP biomarker with/without ultrasonography for HCC surveillance in patients with advanced liver disease. However, traditional biomarkers are sub-optimal for risk stratification of HCC development in high-risk populations, early diagnosis, prognostication, and treatment response prediction. Since about 20% of HCCs do not produce α-FP due to its biological diversity, combining α-FP with novel biomarkers can enhance HCC detection sensitivity. There is a chance to offer promising cancer management methods in high-risk populations by utilizing HCC screening strategies derived from new tumor biomarkers and prognostic scores created by combining biomarkers with distinct clinical parameters. Despite numerous efforts to identify molecules as potential biomarkers, there is no single ideal marker in HCC. When combined with other clinical parameters, the detection of some biomarkers has higher sensitivity and specificity in comparison with a single biomarker. Therefore, newer biomarkers and models, such as the Lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive fraction of Alpha-fetoprotein (α-FP), α-FP-L3, Des-γ-carboxy-prothrombin (DCP or PIVKA-II), and the GALAD score, are being used more frequently in the diagnosis and prognosis of HCC. Notably, the GALAD algorithm was effective in HCC prevention, particularly for cirrhotic patients, regardless of the cause of their liver disease. Although the role of these biomarkers in surveillance is still being researched, they may provide a more practical alternative to traditional imaging-based surveillance. Finally, looking for new diagnostic/surveillance tools may help improve patients' survival. This review discusses the current roles of the most used biomarkers and prognostic scores that may aid in the clinical management of HCC patients."

Numerous normalization and pre-processing methods have been developed to reduce probe type bias as well as other issues such as background and dye bias.This study evaluates the performance of various normalization methods using 16 replicated samples and three metrics: absolute beta-value difference, overlap of non-replicated CpGs between replicate pairs, and effect on beta-value distributions. Additionally, we carried out Pearson's correlation and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) analyses using both raw and SeSAMe 2 normalized data.The method we define as SeSAMe 2, which consists of the application of the regular SeSAMe pipeline with an additional round of QC, pOOBAH masking, was found to be the best performing normalization method, while quantile-based methods were found to be the worst performing methods. Whole-array Pearson's correlations were found to be high. However, in agreement with previous studies, a substantial proportion of the probes on the EPIC array showed poor reproducibility (ICC < 0.50). The majority of poor performing probes have beta values close to either 0 or 1, and relatively low standard deviations. These results suggest that probe reliability is largely the result of limited biological variation rather than technical measurement variation. Importantly, normalizing the data with SeSAMe 2 dramatically improved ICC estimates, with the proportion of probes with ICC values > 0.50 increasing from 45.18% (raw data) to 61.35% (SeSAMe 2).© 2023.

"36896421","Disease-gene prediction based on preserving structure network embedding.","Front Aging Neurosci","Many diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), are caused by abnormalities or mutations of related genes. Many computational methods based on the network relationship between diseases and genes have been proposed to predict potential pathogenic genes. However, how to effectively mine the disease-gene relationship network to predict disease genes better is still an open problem. In this paper, a disease-gene-prediction method based on preserving structure network embedding (PSNE) is introduced. In order to predict pathogenic genes more effectively, a heterogeneous network with multiple types of bio-entities was constructed by integrating disease-gene associations, human protein network, and disease-disease associations. Furthermore, the low-dimension features of nodes extracted from the network were used to reconstruct a new disease-gene heterogeneous network. Compared with other advanced methods, the performance of PSNE has been confirmed more effective in disease-gene prediction. Finally, we applied the PSNE method to predict potential pathogenic genes for age-associated diseases such as AD and PD. We verified the effectiveness of these predicted potential genes by literature verification. Overall, this work provides an effective method for disease-gene prediction, and a series of high-confidence potential pathogenic genes of AD and PD which may be helpful for the experimental discovery of disease genes.Copyright © 2023 Ma, Qin and Xiang."

Functional precision oncology is emerging as a complementary approach that aims to bridge the gap between genotype and phenotype by modelling individual tumours in vitro. These patient-derived ex vivo models largely preserve several tumour characteristics that are not captured by genomics approaches and enable the functional dissection of tumour vulnerabilities in a personalized manner. In this Review, we discuss several examples of personalized functional assays involving tumour organoids, spheroids and explants and their potential to predict treatment responses and drug-induced toxicities in individual patients. These developments have opened exciting new avenues for precision oncology, with the potential for successful clinical applications in contexts in which genomic data alone are not informative. To implement these assays into clinical practice, we outline four key barriers that need to be overcome: assay success rates, turnaround times, the need for standardized conditions and the definition of in vitro responders. Furthermore, we discuss novel technological advances such as microfluidics that might reduce sample requirements, assay times and labour intensity and thereby enable functional precision oncology to be implemented in routine clinical practice.© 2023.

The benefits of the most common systemic therapy for various pancreatic cancers have been masked by high drug toxicities, adverse reactions, and resistance. The use of nanocarriers such as liposomes to overcome these unwanted effects has become very popular. This study aims to formulate 1,3-bistertrahydrofuran-2yl-5FU (MFU)-loaded liposomal nanoparticles (Zhubech) and to evaluate itsstability, release kinetics, in vitro and in vivo anticancer activities, and biodistribution in different tissues. Particle size and zeta potential were determined using a particle size analyzer, while cellular uptake of rhodamine-entrapped liposomal nanoparticles (Rho-LnPs) was determined by confocal microscopy. Gadolinium hexanoate (Gd-Hex) was synthesized and entrapped into the liposomal nanoparticle (LnP) (Gd-Hex-LnP), as a model contrast agent, to evaluate gadolinium biodistribution and accumulation by LnPs in vivo using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The mean hydrodynamic diameters of blank LnPs and Zhubech were 90.0 ± 0.65 nm and 124.9 ± 3.2 nm, respectively. The hydrodynamic diameter of Zhubech was found to be highly stable at 4 °C and 25 °C for 30 days in solution. In vitro drug release of MFU from Zhubech formulation exhibited the Higuchi model (R2value = 0.95). Both Miapaca-2 and Panc-1 treated with Zhubech showed reduced viability, two- or four-fold lower than that of MFU-treated cells in 3D spheroid (IC50Zhubech= 3.4 ± 1.0 μM vs. IC50MFU= 6.8 ± 1.1 μM) and organoid (IC50Zhubech= 9.8 ± 1.4 μM vs. IC50MFU= 42.3 ± 1.0 μM) culture models. Confocal imaging confirmed a high uptake of rhodamine-entrapped LnP by Panc-1 cells in a time-dependent manner. Tumor-efficacy studies in a PDX bearing mouse model revealed a more than 9-fold decrease in mean tumor volumes in Zhubech-treated (108 ± 13.5 mm3) compared to 5-FU-treated (1107 ± 116.2 mm3) animals, respectively. This study demonstrates that Zhubech may be a potential candidate for delivering drugs for pancreatic cancer treatment."

Septic patients (n = 23) and healthy volunteers (n = 10) were enrolled according to SEPSIS 3.0. Peripheral blood was collected within 24 h of enrollment, RNA-seq was performed on the peripheral blood. The sequencing data was screened for DEGs (p < 0.01; logFC ≥ 2). PPI, WGCNA and survival curve analysis were used to identify potential targets. Then, 5 PBMC samples were conducted by single-cell sequencing for cell lineage location. Finally, mouse sepsis model and clinic samples were performed to verify the targets gene using RNA-seq and RT-PCR, respectively. Compared to the control group, 1007 DEGs were found in septic group. BCL9L, BCL11B, CD247, CD96, MAFG and SAMD3 were in the core of network. These six genes correlated to the survival rate of septic patients and they were mainly expressed in T cells, except that MAFG was located in monocyte cell. The expression levels of six key genes were confirmed by animal and clinical samples. BCL9L, BCL11B, CD247, CD96 and SAMD3 were decreased in sepsis and mainly expressed in the T cell; while MAFG increased in sepsis and localizes to monocytes. These genes may be therapeutic targets for sepsis.© 2023. The Author(s)."

CRISPR-Cas9, a tool for making targeted genomic edits, has given rise to various novel applications that have greatly accelerated discovery in developmental biology. Recent work has coupled a CRISPR-Cas9-based lineage tracing platform with single-cell transcriptomics in the unexplored context of cancer metastasis. In this perspective, we briefly reflect on the development of these distinct technological advances and the process by which they have become integrated. We also highlight the importance of single-cell lineage tracing in oncology drug development and suggest the profound capacity of a high-resolution, computational approach to reshape cancer drug discovery by enabling identification of novel metastasis-specific drug targets and mechanisms of resistance."

"36794929","The epigenetic legacy of ICU feeding and its consequences.","Curr Opin Crit Care","Many critically ill patients face physical, mental or neurocognitive impairments up to years later, the etiology remaining largely unexplained. Aberrant epigenetic changes have been linked to abnormal development and diseases resulting from adverse environmental exposures like major stress or inadequate nutrition. Theoretically, severe stress and artificial nutritional management of critical illness thus could induce epigenetic changes explaining long-term problems. We review supporting evidence.Epigenetic abnormalities are found in various critical illness types, affecting DNA-methylation, histone-modification and noncoding RNAs. They at least partly arise de novo after ICU-admission. Many affect genes with functions relevant for and several associate with long-term impairments. As such, de novo DNA-methylation changes in critically ill children statistically explained part of their disturbed long-term physical/neurocognitive development. These methylation changes were in part evoked by early-parenteral-nutrition (early-PN) and statistically explained harm by early-PN on long-term neurocognitive development. Finally, long-term epigenetic abnormalities beyond hospital-discharge have been identified, affecting pathways highly relevant for long-term outcomes.Epigenetic abnormalities induced by critical illness or its nutritional management provide a plausible molecular basis for their adverse effects on long-term outcomes. Identifying treatments to further attenuate these abnormalities opens perspectives to reduce the debilitating legacy of critical illness.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

AD does not have a vital genetic factor to relate to. There were no reliable techniques and methods to identify the genetic risk factors associated with AD in the past. Most of the data available were from the brain images. However, recently, there have been drastic advancements in the high-throughput techniques in bioinformatics. It has led to focused researches in discovering the AD causing genetic risk factors. Recent analysis has resulted in considerable prefrontal cortex data with which classification and prediction models can be developed for AD. We have developed a Deep Belief Network-based prediction model using the DNA Methylation and Gene Expression Microarray Data, with High Dimension Low Sample Size (HDLSS) issues. To overcome the HDLSS challenge, we performed a two-layer feature selection considering the biological aspects of the features as well. In the two-layered feature selection approach, first the differentially expressed genes and differentially methylated positions are identified, then both the datasets are combined using Jaccard similarity measure. As the second step, an ensemble-based feature selection approach is implemented to further narrow down the gene selection. The results show that the proposed feature selection technique outperforms the existing commonly used feature selection techniques, such as Support Vector Machine Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE), and Correlation-based Feature Selection (CBS). Furthermore, the Deep Belief Network-based prediction model performs better than the widely used Machine Learning models. Also, the multi-omics dataset shows promising results compared to the single omics.© 2023 The Authors."

We take a developmentally-sensitive approach to examine the neurodevelopmental sequelae of early adversity in a preregistered meta-analysis of 27,234 youth (birth to 18-years-old), providing the largest group of adversity-exposed youth to date. Findings demonstrate that early-life adversity does not have an ontogenetically uniform impact on brain volumes, but instead exhibits age-, experience-, and region-specific associations. Relative to non-exposed comparisons, interpersonal early adversity (e.g., family-based maltreatment) was associated with initially larger volumes in frontolimbic regions until ~10-years-old, after which these exposures were linked to increasingly smaller volumes. By contrast, socioeconomic disadvantage (e.g., poverty) was associated with smaller volumes in temporal-limbic regions in childhood, which were attenuated at older ages. These findings advance ongoing debates regarding why, when, and how early-life adversity shapes later neural outcomes."
"36900172","State of the Art: ctDNA in Upper Gastrointestinal Malignancies.","Cancers (Basel)","Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has emerged as a promising non-invasive source to characterize genetic alterations related to the tumor. Upper gastrointestinal cancers, including gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (GEC), biliary tract cancer (BTC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PADC) are poor prognostic malignancies, usually diagnosed at advanced stages when no longer amenable to surgical resection and show a poor prognosis even for resected patients. In this sense, ctDNA has emerged as a promising non-invasive tool with different applications, from early diagnosis to molecular characterization and follow-up of tumor genomic evolution. In this manuscript, novel advances in the field of ctDNA analysis in upper gastrointestinal tumors are presented and discussed. Overall, ctDNA analyses can help in early diagnosis, outperforming current diagnostic approaches. Detection of ctDNA prior to surgery or active treatment is also a prognostic marker that associates with worse survival, while ctDNA detection after surgery is indicative of minimal residual disease, anticipating in some cases the imaging-based detection of progression. In the advanced setting, ctDNA analyses characterize the genetic landscape of the tumor and identify patients for targeted-therapy approaches, and studies show variable concordance levels with tissue-based genetic testing. In this line, several studies also show that ctDNA serves to follow responses to active therapy, especially in targeted approaches, where it can detect multiple resistance mechanisms. Unfortunately, current studies are still limited and observational. Future prospective multi-center and interventional studies, carefully designed to assess the value of ctDNA to help clinical decision-making, will shed light on the real applicability of ctDNA in upper gastrointestinal tumor management. This manuscript presents a review of the evidence available in this field up to date."

We aimed to establish a cfDNA-based DNA methylation marker panel to differentially diagnose papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) from benign thyroid nodule (BTN).220 PTC- and 188 BTN patients were enrolled. Methylation markers of PTC were identified from patients' tissue and plasma by reduced representation bisulfite sequencing and methylation haplotype analyses. They were combined with PTC markers from literatures and were tested on additional PTC and BTN samples to verify PTC-detecting ability using targeted methylation sequencing. Top markers were developed into ThyMet and were tested in 113 PTC and 88 BTN cases to train and validate a PTC-plasma classifier. Integration of ThyMet and thyroid ultrasonography was explored to improve accuracy.From 859 potential PTC plasma-discriminating markers that include 81 markers identified by us, the top 98 most PTC plasma-discriminating markers were selected for ThyMet. A 6-marker ThyMet classifier for PTC plasma was trained. In validation it achieved an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.828, similar to thyroid ultrasonography (0.833) but at higher specificity (0.722 and 0.625 for ThyMet and ultrasonography, respectively). A combinatorial classifier by them, ThyMet-US, improved AUC to 0.923 (sensitivity = 0.957, specificity = 0.708).The ThyMet classifier improved the specificity of differentiating PTC from BTN over ultrasonography.

Accumulating evidence suggests that PANoptosis plays a crucial role in tumorigenesis. However, the respective regulation mechanisms in cancer are so far unclear. Using various bioinformatic approaches, we comprehensively analyzed the expression patterns, genetic alterations, prognostic value, and immunological role of PANoptosis genes in pan-cancer. Expression of the PANoptosis gene, PYCARD, was validated based on the Human Protein Atlas database and real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We found that PANoptosis genes were aberrantly expressed in most cancer types, which was consistent with the validation of PYCARD expression. Concurrently, PANoptosis genes and PANoptosis scores were significantly associated with patient survival in 21 and 14 cancer types, respectively. Pathway analysis showed that PANoptosis score was positively correlated with pathways linked to immune and inflammatory responses in pan-cancer, such as IL6-JAK-STAT3 signaling, the interferon-gamma response, and IL2-STAT5 signaling. In addition, the PANoptosis score was significantly correlated with the tumor microenvironment, the infiltration levels of most immune cells (i.e.NK cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, DC cells), and immune-related genes. Furthermore, it was a predictive indicator of immunotherapy response in patients with tumors. These insights substantially improve our understanding of PANoptosis components in cancers and may inspire the discovery of novel prognostic and immunotherapy response biomarkers.© 2023.

"36873930","Microsatellite instability-related prognostic risk score (MSI-pRS) defines a subset of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) patients with genomic instability and poor clinical outcome.","Front Genet","Background:Lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) shares less typical onco-drivers and target resistance, but a high overall mutation rate and marked genomic complexity. Mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency leads to microsatellite instability (MSI) and genomic instability. MSI is not an ideal option for prognosis of LUSC, whereas its function deserves exploration.Method:MSI status was classified by MMR proteins using unsupervised clustering in the TCGA-LUSC dataset. The MSI score of each sample was determined by gene set variation analysis. Intersections of the differential expression genes and differential methylation probes were classified into functional modules by weighted gene co-expression network analysis. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression and stepwise gene selection were performed for model downscaling.Results:Compared with the MSI-low (MSI-L) phenotype, MSI-high (MSI-H) displayed higher genomic instability. The MSI score was decreased from MSI-H to normal samples (MSI-H > MSI-L > normal). A total of 843 genes activated by hypomethylation and 430 genes silenced by hypermethylation in MSI-H tumors were classified into six functional modules. CCDC68, LYSMD1, RPS7, and CDK20 were used to construct MSI-related prognostic risk score (MSI-pRS). Low MSI-pRS was a protective prognostic factor in all cohorts (HR = 0.46, 0.47, 0.37;p-value = 7.57e-06, 0.009, 0.021). The model contains tumor stage, age, and MSI-pRS that showed good discrimination and calibration. Decision curve analyses indicated that microsatellite instability-related prognostic risk score added extra value to the prognosis. A low MSI-pRS was negatively correlated with genomic instability. LUSC with low MSI-pRS was associated with increased genomic instability and cold immunophenotype.Conclusion:MSI-pRS is a promising prognostic biomarker in LUSC as the substitute of MSI. Moreover, we first declared that LYSMD1 contributed to genomic instability of LUSC.

In addition to thousands ofcischanges, we discover an unexpected number (~10,000) oftranschanges and show thatcisandtranselements exhibit distinct patterns of sequence divergence and function. We further identify differentially expressed transcription factors that underlie >50% oftransdifferences and trace howcischanges can produce cascades oftranschanges. Overall, we find that most divergent elements (67%) experienced changes in bothcisandtrans, revealing a substantial role fortransdivergence-alone and together withcischanges-to regulatory differences between species."
"36894706","Major cell-types in multiomic single-nucleus datasets impact statistical modeling of links between regulatory sequences and target genes.","Sci Rep","Epigenomic profiling, including ATACseq, is one of the main tools used to define enhancers. Because enhancers are overwhelmingly cell-type specific, inference of their activity is greatly limited in complex tissues. Multiomic assays that probe in the same nucleus both the open chromatin landscape and gene expression levels enable the study of correlations (links) between these two modalities. Current best practices to infer the regulatory effect of candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) in multiomic data involve removing biases associated with GC content by generating null distributions of matched ATACseq peaks drawn from different chromosomes. This strategy has been broadly adopted by popular single-nucleus multiomic workflows such as Signac. Here, we uncovered limitations and confounders of this approach. We found a strong loss of power to detect a regulatory effect for cCREs with high read counts in the dominant cell-type. We showed that this is largely due to cell-type-specific trans-ATACseq peak correlations creating bimodal null distributions. We tested alternative models and concluded that physical distance and/or the raw Pearson correlation coefficients are the best predictors for peak-gene links when compared to predictions from Epimap (e.g. CD14 area under the curve [AUC] = 0.51 with the method implemented in Signac vs. 0.71 with the Pearson correlation coefficients) or validation by CRISPR perturbations (AUC = 0.63 vs. 0.73).© 2023.

"36695505","Computational approaches to understand transcription regulation in development.","Biochem Soc Trans","Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) serve as useful abstractions to understand transcriptional dynamics in developmental systems. Computational prediction of GRNs has been successfully applied to genome-wide gene expression measurements with the advent of microarrays and RNA-sequencing. However, these inferred networks are inaccurate and mostly based on correlative rather than causative interactions. In this review, we highlight three approaches that significantly impact GRN inference: (1) moving from one genome-wide functional modality, gene expression, to multi-omics, (2) single cell sequencing, to measure cell type-specific signals and predict context-specific GRNs, and (3) neural networks as flexible models. Together, these experimental and computational developments have the potential to significantly impact the quality of inferred GRNs. Ultimately, accurately modeling the regulatory interactions between transcription factors and their target genes will be essential to understand the role of transcription factors in driving developmental gene expression programs and to derive testable hypotheses for validation.© 2023 The Author(s)."
"36911498","Markers of aging: Unsupervised integrated analyses of the human plasma proteome.","Front Aging","Aging associates with an increased susceptibility for disease and decreased quality of life. To date, processes underlying aging are still not well understood, leading to limited interventions with unknown mechanisms to promote healthy aging. Previous research suggests that changes in the blood proteome are reflective of age-associated phenotypes such as frailty. Moreover, experimentally induced changes in the blood proteome composition can accelerate or decelerate underlying aging processes. The aim of this study is to identify a set of proteins in the human plasma associated with aging by integration of the data of four independent, large-scaled datasets using the aptamer-based SomaScan platform on the human aging plasma proteome. Using this approach, we identified a set of 273 plasma proteins significantly associated with aging (aging proteins, APs) across these cohorts consisting of healthy individuals and individuals with comorbidities and highlight their biological functions. We validated the age-associated effects in an independent study using a centenarian population, showing highly concordant effects. Our results suggest that APs are more associated to diseases than other plasma proteins. Plasma levels of APs can predict chronological age, and a reduced selection of 15 APs can still predict individuals' age accurately, highlighting their potential as biomarkers of aging processes. Furthermore, we show that individuals presenting accelerated or decelerated aging based on their plasma proteome, respectively have a more aged or younger systemic environment. These results provide novel insights in the understanding of the aging process and its underlying mechanisms and highlight potential modulators contributing to healthy aging.Copyright © 2023 Coenen, Lehallier, de Vries and Middeldorp."

The dynamic signaling that occurs between tumor cells and the diverse cells of the surrounding tumor microenvironment actively promotes disease progression and therapeutic resistance. Improving the understanding of how tumors evolve following therapy and the molecular mechanisms underpinning de novo or acquired resistance is thus critical for the identification of new targets and for the subsequent development of more effective combination regimens. Simultaneously targeting multiple hallmark capabilities of cancer to circumvent adaptive or evasive resistance may lead to significantly improved treatment response in the clinic. Here, the latest applications of functional genomics tools, such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) editing, to characterize the dynamic cancer resistance mechanisms, from improving the understanding of resistance to classical chemotherapeutics, to deciphering unique mechanisms that regulate tumor responses to new targeted agents and immunotherapies, are discussed. Potential avenues of future research in combating therapeutic resistance, the contribution of tumor-stroma signaling in this setting, and how advanced functional genomics tools can help streamline the identification of key molecular determinants of drug response are explored.© 2022 The Authors.

However, how necroptosis pathway is activated in this process remains elusive. Here we report that the reactivation of transposable elements (TEs) upon SETDB1 knockout is responsible for the RIPK3 regulation through both cis and trans mechanisms. IAPLTR2_Mm and MMERVK10c-int, both of which are suppressed by SETDB1-dependent H3K9me3, act as enhancer-like cis-regulatory elements and their RIPK3 nearby members enhance RIPK3 expression when SETDB1 is knockout. Moreover, reactivated endogenous retroviruses generate excessive viral mimicry, which promotes necroptosis mainly through Z-DNA-binding protein 1 (ZBP1). These results indicate TEs play an important role in regulating necroptosis.© 2023. The Author(s)."

"36702125","Centromeres as universal hotspots of DNA breakage, driving RAD51-mediated recombination during quiescence.","Mol Cell","Centromeres are essential for chromosome segregation in most animals and plants yet are among the most rapidly evolving genome elements. The mechanisms underlying this paradoxical phenomenon remain enigmatic. Here, we report that human centromeres innately harbor a striking enrichment of DNA breaks within functionally active centromere regions. Establishing a single-cell imaging strategy that enables comparative assessment of DNA breaks at repetitive regions, we show that centromeric DNA breaks are induced not only during active cellular proliferation but also de novo during quiescence. Markedly, centromere DNA breaks in quiescent cells are resolved enzymatically by the evolutionarily conserved RAD51 recombinase, which in turn safeguards the specification of functional centromeres. This study highlights the innate fragility of centromeres, which may have been co-opted over time to reinforce centromere specification while driving rapid evolution. The findings also provide insights into how fragile centromeres are likely to contribute to human disease.Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Due to a significantly increased radiosensitivity, measured before the start of radiotherapy of a rhabdoid tumor in a child with Phelan-McDermid syndrome, the question arose whether other patients with this syndrome also have increased radiosensitivity. For this purpose, the radiation sensitivity of blood lymphocytes after irradiation with 2Gray was examined using the G0 three-color fluorescence in situ hybridization assay in a cohort of 20 patients with Phelan-McDermid syndrome from blood samples. The results were compared to healthy volunteers, breast cancer patients and rectal cancer patients. Independent of age and gender, all but two patients with Phelan-McDermid syndrome showed significantly increased radiosensitivity, with an average of 0.653 breaks per metaphase. These results correlated neither with the individual genetic findings nor with the individual clinical course, nor with the respective clinical severity of the disease. In our pilot study, we saw a significantly increased radiosensitivity in lymphocytes from patients with Phelan-McDermid syndrome, so pronounced that a dose reduction would be recommended if radiotherapy had to be performed. Ultimately, the question arises as to the interpretation of these data. There does not appear to be an increased risk of tumors in these patients, since tumors are rare overall. The question, therefore, arose as to whether our results could possibly be the basis for processes, such as aging/preaging, or, in this context, neurodegeneration. There are no data on this so far, but this issue should be pursued in further fundamentally based studies in order to better understand the pathophysiology of the syndrome."

This translational research examined the implications of DNA methylation associated with the high-intensity interval training (HIIT) effects on cardiac fibrosis in patients with heart failure (HF).Twelve HF patients were included and received cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging with late gadolinium enhancement for cardiac fibrosis severity and a cardiopulmonary exercise test for peak oxygen consumption ([Formula: see text]O2peak). Afterwards, they underwent 36 sessions of HIIT at alternating 80% and 40% of [Formula: see text]O2peakfor 30 min per session in 3-4 months. Human serum from 11 participants, as a means to link cell biology to clinical presentations, was used to investigate the exercise effects on cardiac fibrosis. Primary human cardiac fibroblasts (HCFs) were incubated in patient serum, and analyses of cell behaviour, proteomics (n = 6) and DNA methylation profiling (n = 3) were performed. All measurements were conducted after completing HIIT.A significant increase (p = 0.009) in [Formula: see text]O2peak(pre- vs. post-HIIT = 19.0 ± 1.1 O2ml/kg/min vs. 21.8 ± 1.1 O2ml/kg/min) was observed after HIIT. The exercise strategy resulted in a significant decrease in left ventricle (LV) volume by 15% to 40% (p < 0.05) and a significant increase in LV ejection fraction by approximately 30% (p = 0.010). LV myocardial fibrosis significantly decreased from 30.9 ± 1.2% to 27.2 ± 0.8% (p = 0.013) and from 33.4 ± 1.6% to 30.1 ± 1.6% (p = 0.021) in the middle and apical LV myocardium after HIIT, respectively. The mean single-cell migration speed was significantly (p = 0.044) greater for HCFs treated with patient serum before (2.15 ± 0.17 μm/min) than after (1.11 ± 0.12 μm/min) HIIT. Forty-three of 1222 identified proteins were significantly involved in HIIT-induced altered HCF activities. There was significant (p = 0.044) hypermethylation of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase very long chain (ACADVL) gene with a 4.474-fold increase after HIIT, which could activate downstream caspase-mediated actin disassembly and the cell death pathway.Human investigation has shown that HIIT is associated with reduced cardiac fibrosis in HF patients. Hypermethylation of ACADVL after HIIT may contribute to impeding HCF activities. This exercise-associated epigenetic reprogramming may contribute to reduce cardiac fibrosis and promote cardiorespiratory fitness in HF patients.NCT04038723.

"36879504","The role of immune activation and antigen persistence in acute and long COVID.","J Investig Med","In late 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) triggered the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Although most infections cause a self-limited syndrome comparable to other upper respiratory viral pathogens, a portion of individuals develop severe illness leading to substantial morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, an estimated 10%-20% of SARS-CoV-2 infections are followed by post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), or long COVID. Long COVID is associated with a wide variety of clinical manifestations including cardiopulmonary complications, persistent fatigue, and neurocognitive dysfunction. Severe acute COVID-19 is associated with hyperactivation and increased inflammation, which may be an underlying cause of long COVID in a subset of individuals. However, the immunologic mechanisms driving long COVID development are still under investigation. Early in the pandemic, our group and others observed immune dysregulation persisted into convalescence after acute COVID-19. We subsequently observed persistent immune dysregulation in a cohort of individuals experiencing long COVID. We demonstrated increased SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+and CD8+T-cell responses and antibody affinity in patients experiencing long COVID symptoms. These data suggest a portion of long COVID symptoms may be due to chronic immune activation and the presence of persistent SARS-CoV-2 antigen. This review summarizes the COVID-19 literature to date detailing acute COVID-19 and convalescence and how these observations relate to the development of long COVID. In addition, we discuss recent findings in support of persistent antigen and the evidence that this phenomenon contributes to local and systemic inflammation and the heterogeneous nature of clinical manifestations seen in long COVID."
"36898736","Germline genetic variants are associated with development of insulin-dependent diabetes in cancer patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors.","J Immunother Cancer","Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have dramatically improved survival in patients with cancer but are often accompanied by severe immune-related adverse events (irAEs), which can sometimes be irreversible. Insulin-dependent diabetes is a rare, but life-altering irAE. Our purpose was to determine whether recurrent somatic or germline mutations are observed in patients who develop insulin-dependent diabetes as an irAE.We performed RNA and whole exome sequencing on tumors from 13 patients who developed diabetes due to ICI exposure (ICI-induced diabetes mellitus, ICI-DM) compared with control patients who did not develop diabetes.In tumors from ICI-DM patients, we did not find differences in expression of conventional type 1 diabetes autoantigens, but we did observe significant overexpression of ORM1, PLG, and G6PC, all of which have been implicated in type 1 diabetes or are related to pancreas and islet cell function. Interestingly, we observed a missense mutation in NLRC5 in tumors of 9 of the 13 ICI-DM patients that was not observed in the control patients treated with the same drugs for the same cancers. Germline DNA from the ICI-DM patients was sequenced; allNLRC5mutations were germline. The prevalence ofNLRC5germline variants was significantly greater than the general population (p=5.98×10-6). Although NLRC5 is implicated in development of type 1 diabetes, germlineNLRC5mutations were not found in public databases from patients with type 1 diabetes, suggesting a different mechanism of insulin-dependent diabetes in immunotherapy-treated patients with cancer.Validation of theNLRC5mutation as a potential predictive biomarker is warranted, as it might improve patient selection for treatment regimens. Furthermore, this genetic alteration suggests potential mechanisms of islet cell destruction in the setting of checkpoint inhibitor therapy.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

"36917262","Ensemble learning-based gene signature and risk model for predicting prognosis of triple-negative breast cancer.","Funct Integr Genomics","Although medical science has been fully developed, due to the high heterogeneity of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), it is still difficult to use reasonable and precise treatment. In this study, based on local optimization-feature screening and genomics screening strategy, we screened 25 feature genes. In multiple machine learning algorithms, feature genes have excellent discriminative diagnostic performance among samples composed of multiple large datasets. After screening at the single-cell level, we identified genes expressed substantially in myeloid cells (MCGs) that have a potential association with TNBC. Based on MCGs, we distinguished two types of TNBC patients who showed considerable differences in survival status and immune-related characteristics. Immune-related gene risk scores (IRGRS) were established, and their validity was verified using validation cohorts. A total of 25 feature genes were obtained, among which CXCL9, CXCL10, CCL7, SPHK1, and TREM1 were identified as the result after single-cell level analysis and screening. According to these entries, the cohort was divided into MCA and MCB subtypes, and the two subtypes had significant differences in survival status and tumor-immune microenvironment. After Lasso-Cox screening, IDO1, GNLY, IRF1, CTLA4, and CXCR6 were selected for constructing IRGRS. There were significant differences in drug sensitivity and immunotherapy sensitivity among high-IRGRS and low-IRGRS groups. We revealed the dynamic relationship between TNBC and TIME, identified a potential biomarker called Granulysin (GNLY) related to immunity, and developed a multi-process machine learning package called ""MPMLearning 1.0"" in Python.© 2023.

Further understanding of disease mechanisms and therapeutic strategies requires a deeper knowledge of CMs in humans. Herein, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis on unselected viable cells from twelve human CM samples and three control samples. A total of 112,670 high-quality cells were clustered into 11 major cell types, which shared a number of common features in CMs harboring different genetic mutations. A new EC subpopulation marked with PLVAP was uniquely identified in lesions. The cellular ligand‒receptor network revealed that the PLVAP-positive EC subcluster was the strongest contributor to the ANGPT and VEGF signaling pathways in all cell types. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway was strongly activated in the PLVAP-positive subcluster even in non-PIK3CA mutation carriers. Moreover, endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) cells were identified for the first time in CMs at the single-cell level, which was accompanied by strong immune activation. The transcription factor SPI1 was predicted to be a novel key driver of EndMT, which was confirmed by in vitro and in vivo studies. A specific fibroblast-like phenotype was more prevalent in lesion smooth muscle cells, hinting at the role of vessel reconstructions and repairs in CMs, and we also confirmed that TWIST1 could induce SMC phenotypic switching in vitro and in vivo. Our results provide novel insights into the pathomechanism decryption and further precise therapy of CMs.© 2023. The Author(s)."

"36824744","Single-strand mismatch and damage patterns revealed by single-molecule DNA sequencing.","bioRxiv","Mutations accumulate in the genome of every cell of the body throughout life, causing cancer and other genetic diseases1-4. Almost all of these mosaic mutations begin as nucleotide mismatches or damage in only one of the two strands of the DNA prior to becoming double-strand mutations if unrepaired or misrepaired5. However, current DNA sequencing technologies cannot resolve these initial single-strand events. Here, we developed a single-molecule, long-read sequencing method that achieves single-molecule fidelity for single-base substitutions when present in either one or both strands of the DNA. It also detects single-strand cytosine deamination events, a common type of DNA damage. We profiled 110 samples from diverse tissues, including from individuals with cancer-predisposition syndromes, and define the first single-strand mismatch and damage signatures. We find correspondences between these single-strand signatures and known double-strand mutational signatures, which resolves the identity of the initiating lesions. Tumors deficient in both mismatch repair and replicative polymerase proofreading show distinct single-strand mismatch patterns compared to samples deficient in only polymerase proofreading. In the mitochondrial genome, our findings support a mutagenic mechanism occurring primarily during replication. Since the double-strand DNA mutations interrogated by prior studies are only the endpoint of the mutation process, our approach to detect the initiating single-strand events at single-molecule resolution will enable new studies of how mutations arise in a variety of contexts, especially in cancer and aging."
"36894639","Disrupting the phase separation of KAT8-IRF1 diminishes PD-L1 expression and promotes antitumor immunity.","Nat Cancer","Immunotherapies targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis have become first-line treatments in multiple cancers. However, only a limited subset of individuals achieves durable benefits because of the elusive mechanisms regulating PD-1/PD-L1. Here, we report that in cells exposed to interferon-γ (IFNγ), KAT8 undergoes phase separation with induced IRF1 and forms biomolecular condensates to upregulate PD-L1. Multivalency from both the specific and promiscuous interactions between IRF1 and KAT8 is required for condensate formation. KAT8-IRF1 condensation promotes IRF1 K78 acetylation and binding to the CD247 (PD-L1) promoter and further enriches the transcription apparatus to promote transcription of PD-L1 mRNA. Based on the mechanism of KAT8-IRF1 condensate formation, we identified the 2142-R8 blocking peptide, which disrupts KAT8-IRF1 condensate formation and consequently inhibits PD-L1 expression and enhances antitumor immunity in vitro and in vivo. Our findings reveal a key role of KAT8-IRF1 condensates in PD-L1 regulation and provide a competitive peptide to enhance antitumor immune responses.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36875159","Biomolecular condensates: Formation mechanisms, biological functions, and therapeutic targets.","MedComm (2020)","Biomolecular condensates are cellular structures composed of membraneless assemblies comprising proteins or nucleic acids. The formation of these condensates requires components to change from a state of solubility separation from the surrounding environment by undergoing phase transition and condensation. Over the past decade, it has become widely appreciated that biomolecular condensates are ubiquitous in eukaryotic cells and play a vital role in physiological and pathological processes. These condensates may provide promising targets for the clinic research. Recently, a series of pathological and physiological processes have been found associated with the dysfunction of condensates, and a range of targets and methods have been demonstrated to modulate the formation of these condensates. A more extensive description of biomolecular condensates is urgently needed for the development of novel therapies. In this review, we summarized the current understanding of biomolecular condensates and the molecular mechanisms of their formation. Moreover, we reviewed the functions of condensates and therapeutic targets for diseases. We further highlighted the available regulatory targets and methods, discussed the significance and challenges of targeting these condensates. Reviewing the latest developments in biomolecular condensate research could be essential in translating our current knowledge on the use of condensates for clinical therapeutic strategies.© 2023 The Authors.

"36894991","Associations of genetic markers of diabetes mellitus with carotid atherosclerosis: a community-based case-control study.","Cardiovasc Diabetol","Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a well-established determinant of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Recently, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified several single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) significantly correlated with DM. The study aimed to explore the relationships of the top significant DM SNPs with carotid atherosclerosis (CA).We used a case-control design and randomly selected 309 cases and 439 controls with and without, respectively, carotid plaque (CP) from a community-based cohort. Eight recent GWAS on DM in East Asians reported hundreds of SNPs with genome-wide significance. The study used the top significant DM SNPs, with a p-value < 10-16, as the candidate genetic markers of CA. The independent effects of these DM SNPs on CA were assessed by multivariable logistic regression analyses to control the effects of conventional cardio-metabolic risk factors.Multivariable analyses showed that, 9 SNPs, including rs4712524, rs1150777, rs10842993, rs2858980, rs9583907, rs1077476, rs7180016, rs4383154, and rs9937354, showed promising associations with the presence of carotid plaque (CP). Among them, rs9937354, rs10842993, rs7180016, and rs4383154 showed significantly independent effects. The means (SD) of the 9-locus genetic risk score (9-GRS) of CP-positive and -negative subjects were 9.19 (1.53) and 8.62 (1.63), respectively (p < 0.001). The corresponding values of 4-locus GRS (4-GRS) were 4.02 (0.81) and. 3.78 (0.92), respectively (p < 0.001). The multivariable-adjusted odds ratio of having CP for per 1.0 increase in 9-GRS and 4-GRS were 1.30 (95% CI 1.18-1.44; p = 4.7 × 10-7) and 1.47 (95% CI 1.74-9.40; p = 6.1 × 10-5), respectively. The means of multi-locus GRSs of DM patients were similar to those of CP-positive subjects and higher than those of CP-negative or DM-negative subjects.We identified 9 DM SNPs showing promising associations with CP. The multi-locus GRSs may be used as biomarkers for the identification and prediction of high-risks subjects for atherosclerosis and atherosclerotic diseases. Future studies on these specific SNPs and their associated genes may provide valuable information for the preventions of DM and atherosclerosis.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36879818","Modern Japanese ancestry-derived variants reveal the formation process of the current Japanese regional gradations.","iScience","Modern Japanese people have two major ancestral populations: indigenous Jomon hunter-gatherers and continental East Asian farmers. To determine the formation process of the current Japanese population, we developed a detection method for variants derived from ancestral populations using a summary statistic, the ancestry marker index (AMI). We appliedAMIto modern Japanese population samples and identified 208,648 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were likely derived from the Jomon people (Jomon-derived variants). Analysis of Jomon-derived variants in 10,842 modern Japanese individuals recruited from all over Japan revealed that the admixture proportions of the Jomon people varied between prefectures, probably owing to the prehistoric population size difference. The estimated allele frequencies of genome-wide SNPs in the ancestral populations of the modern Japanese suggested their adaptive phenotypic characteristics to their respective livelihoods. Based on our findings, we propose a formation model for the genotypic and phenotypic gradations of the current Japanese archipelago populations.© 2023 The Authors."
"36875854","Fatty acids and risk of dilated cardiomyopathy: A two-sample Mendelian randomization study.","Front Nutr","Previous observational studies have shown intimate associations between fatty acids (FAs) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). However, due to the confounding factors and reverse causal association found in observational epidemiological studies, the etiological explanation is not credible.To exclude possible confounding factors and reverse causal associations found in observational epidemiological studies, we used the two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to verify the causal relationship between FAs and DCM risk.All data of 54 FAs were downloaded from the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) catalog, and the summary statistics of DCM were extracted from the HF Molecular Epidemiology for Therapeutic Targets Consortium GWAS. Two-sample MR analysis was conducted to evaluate the causal effect of FAs on DCM risk through several analytical methods, including MR-Egger, inverse variance weighting (IVW), maximum likelihood, weighted median estimator (WME), and the MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier test (MRPRESSO). Directionality tests using MR-Steiger to assess the possibility of reverse causation.Our analysis identified two FAs, oleic acid and fatty acid (18:1)-OH, that may have a significant causal effect on DCM. MR analyses indicated that oleic acid was suggestively associated with a heightened risk of DCM (OR = 1.291, 95%CI: 1.044-1.595,P= 0.018). As a probable metabolite of oleic acid, fatty acid (18:1)-OH has a suggestive association with a lower risk of DCM (OR = 0.402, 95%CI: 0.167-0.966,P= 0.041). The results of the directionality test suggested that there was no reverse causality between exposure and outcome (P< 0.001). In contrast, the other 52 available FAs were discovered to have no significant causal relationships with DCM (P> 0.05).Our findings propose that oleic acid and fatty acid (18:1)-OH may have causal relationships with DCM, indicating that the risk of DCM from oleic acid may be decreased by encouraging the conversion of oleic acid to fatty acid (18:1)-OH.Copyright © 2023 Zhang, Luo, Hou, Xiao, Long, Hu, Chen and Wang."

The AWI-Gen study GWAS meta-analysis for blood pressure-related traits (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, mean-arterial pressure and hypertension) from three sub-Saharan African geographic regions (N=10,775), identified two genome-wide significant signals (p<5E-08): systolic blood pressure near P2RY1 (rs77846204; intergenic variant, p=4.25E-08) and pulse pressure near Linc01256 (rs80141533; intergenic variant, p=4.25E-08). No genome-wide signals were detected for the AWI-Gen GWAS meta-analysis with previous African-ancestry GWASs (UK Biobank (African), Uganda Genome Resource). Suggestive signals (p<5E-06) were observed for all traits, with 29 displaying pleiotropic effects and several replicating known associations. Polygenic risk scores developed from studies on different ancestries had limited transferability, with multi-ancestry models providing better prediction.

Citespace was applied to generate a dual map to analyze the relationship of citing journals and citied journals and conduct a strong citation bursts ranking analysis of references. Online SRplot was used for in-depth keyword analysis and Microsoft Excel 2019 was used to collect the targeted variables from retrieved articles.1724 papers were collected in this study, including 1547 original articles and 177 reviews. The study of AI in liver cancer mostly began from 2003 and has developed rapidly from 2017. China has the largest number of publications, and the United States has the highest H-index and total citation counts. The top three most productive institutions are the League of European Research Universities, Sun Yat Sen University, and Zhejiang University. Jasjit S. Suri andFrontiers in Oncologyare the most published author and journal, respectively. Keyword analysis showed that in addition to the research on liver cancer, research on liver cirrhosis, fatty liver disease, and liver fibrosis were also common. Computed tomography was the most used diagnostic tool, followed by ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. The diagnosis and differential diagnosis of liver cancer are currently the most widely adopted research goals, and comprehensive analyses of multi-type data and postoperative analysis of patients with advanced liver cancer are rare.

Its aim is to explore the social, behavioural, economic and biological factors of ageing and how these factors change as people age. The study has been designed to maximize comparability with other international studies of ageing thereby facilitating cross-country comparisons. This paper provides an overview of the design and methodology of the health assessment which was carried out as part of Wave 1.Three thousand, six hundred and fifty five community dwelling adults, aged 50 years and over participated in the health assessment as part of Wave 1 of NICOLA. The health assessment included a battery of measurements across various domains that addressed key indicators of ageing namely: physical function, vision and hearing, cognitive function, and cardiovascular health. This manuscript describes the scientific rationale for the choice of assessments, provides an overview of the core objective measures carried out in the health assessment and describes the differences in characteristics of participants who took part in the health assessment compared to those who did not take part.The manuscript highlights the importance of incorporating objective measures of health in population based studies as a means of complementing subjective measures and as a way to advance our understanding of the ageing process. The findings contextualize NICOLA as a data resource within Dementias Platform UK (DPUK), the Gateway to Global Ageing (G2G) and other existing networks of population based longitudinal studies of ageing.This manuscript can help inform design considerations for other population based studies of ageing and facilitate cross-country comparative analysis of key life-course factors affecting healthy ageing such as educational attainment, diet, the accumulation of chronic conditions (including Alzheimer's disease, dementia and cardiovascular disease) as well as welfare and retirement policies.© 2023.

"36901741","circRNA from APP Gene Changes in Alzheimer's Disease Human Brain.","Int J Mol Sci","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of age-related dementia. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is the precursor of Aβ peptides, and its role in AD has been widely investigated. Recently, it has been reported that a circular RNA (circRNA) originated fromAPPgene can serve as a template for Aβ synthesis, postulating it as an alternative pathway for the Aβ biogenesis. Moreover, circRNAs play important roles in brain development and in neurological diseases. Therefore, our aim was to study the expression of a circAPP (hsa_circ_0007556) and its linear cognate in AD human entorhinal cortex, a brain region most vulnerable to AD pathology. First, we confirmed the presence of circAPP (hsa_circ_0007556) in human entorhinal cortex samples using RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing of PCR products. Next, a 0.49-fold decrease in circAPP (hsa_circ_0007556) levels was observed in entorhinal cortex of AD cases compared to controls (p-value < 0.05) by qPCR. In contrast,APPmRNA expression did not show changes in the entorhinal cortex between AD cases and controls (Fold-change = 1.06;p-value = 0.81). A negative correlation was found between Aβ deposits and circAPP (hsa_circ_0007556) andAPPexpression levels (Rho Spearman = -0.56,p-value < 0.001 and Rho Spearman = -0.44,p-values < 0.001, respectively). Finally, by using bioinformatics tools, 17 miRNAs were predicted to bind circAPP (hsa_circ_0007556), and the functional analysis predicted that they were involved in some pathways, such as the Wnt-signaling pathway (p= 3.32 × 10-6). Long-term potentiation (p= 2.86 × 10-5), among others, is known to be altered in AD. To sum up, we show that circAPP (hsa_circ_0007556) is deregulated in the entorhinal cortex of AD patients. These results add to the notion that circAPP (hsa_circ_0007556) could be playing a role in the pathogenesis of AD disease."

In particular, we need efficient yet cost-effective ways to measure CpG methylation states over large and complete regions of the genome. Here, we develop TEEM-Seq (target-enriched enzymatic methyl sequencing), a method that combines enzymatic methyl sequencing with a custom-designed hybridization capture bait set that can be scaled to reactions including large numbers of samples in any species for which a reference genome is available. Using DNA from a passerine bird, the superb starling (Lamprotornis superbus), we show that TEEM-Seq is able to quantify DNA methylation states similarly well to the more traditional approaches of whole-genome and reduced-representation sequencing. Moreover, we demonstrate its reliability and repeatability, as duplicate libraries from the same samples were highly correlated. Importantly, the downstream bioinformatic analysis for TEEM-Seq is the same as for any sequence-based approach to studying DNA methylation, making it simple to incorporate into a variety of workflows. We believe that TEEM-Seq could replace traditional approaches for studying DNA methylation in candidate genes and pathways, and be effectively paired with other whole-genome or reduced-representation sequencing approaches to increase project sample sizes. In addition, TEEM-Seq can be combined with mRNA sequencing to examine how DNA methylation in promoters or other regulatory regions is related to the expression of individual genes or gene networks. By maximizing the number of samples in the hybridization reaction, TEEM-Seq is an inexpensive and flexible sequence-based approach for quantifying DNA methylation in species where other capture-based methods are unavailable or too expensive, particularly for non-model organisms.Copyright: © 2023 Rubenstein, Solomon.

"36902216","A Unified Deep Learning Framework for Single-Cell ATAC-Seq Analysis Based on ProdDep Transformer Encoder.","Int J Mol Sci","Recent advances in single-cell sequencing assays for the transposase-accessibility chromatin (scATAC-seq) technique have provided cell-specific chromatin accessibility landscapes of cis-regulatory elements, providing deeper insights into cellular states and dynamics. However, few research efforts have been dedicated to modeling the relationship between regulatory grammars and single-cell chromatin accessibility and incorporating different analysis scenarios of scATAC-seq data into the general framework. To this end, we propose a unified deep learning framework based on the ProdDep Transformer Encoder, dubbed PROTRAIT, for scATAC-seq data analysis. Specifically motivated by the deep language model, PROTRAIT leverages the ProdDep Transformer Encoder to capture the syntax of transcription factor (TF)-DNA binding motifs from scATAC-seq peaks for predicting single-cell chromatin accessibility and learning single-cell embedding. Based on cell embedding, PROTRAIT annotates cell types using the Louvain algorithm. Furthermore, according to the identified likely noises of raw scATAC-seq data, PROTRAIT denoises these values based on predated chromatin accessibility. In addition, PROTRAIT employs differential accessibility analysis to infer TF activity at single-cell and single-nucleotide resolution. Extensive experiments based on the Buenrostro2018 dataset validate the effeteness of PROTRAIT for chromatin accessibility prediction, cell type annotation, and scATAC-seq data denoising, therein outperforming current approaches in terms of different evaluation metrics. Besides, we confirm the consistency between the inferred TF activity and the literature review. We also demonstrate the scalability of PROTRAIT to analyze datasets containing over one million cells."

However, obtaining an mRNA's subcellular localization through wet-lab experiments is time-consuming and expensive, and many existing mRNA subcellular localization prediction algorithms need to be improved. In this study, a deep neural network-based eukaryotic mRNA subcellular location prediction method, DeepmRNALoc, was proposed, utilizing a two-stage feature extraction strategy that featured bimodal information splitting and fusing for the first stage and a VGGNet-like CNN module for the second stage. The five-fold cross-validation accuracies of DeepmRNALoc in the cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum, extracellular region, mitochondria, and nucleus were 0.895, 0.594, 0.308, 0.944, and 0.865, respectively, demonstrating that it outperforms existing models and techniques."
"36873953","Circulatory proteins relate cardiovascular disease to cognitive performance: A mendelian randomisation study.","Front Genet","Background and objectives:Mechanistic research suggests synergistic effects of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and dementia pathologies on cognitive decline. Interventions targeting proteins relevant to shared mechanisms underlying CVD and dementia could also be used for the prevention of cognitive impairment.Methods:We applied Mendelian randomisation (MR) and colocalization analysis to investigate the causal relationships of 90 CVD-related proteins measured by the Olink CVD I panel with cognitive traits. Genetic instruments for circulatory protein concentrations were obtained using a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) from the SCALLOP consortium (N = 17,747) based on three sets of criteria: 1) protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL); 2)cis-pQTL (pQTL within ±500 kb from the coding gene); and 3) brain-specificcis-expression QTL (cis-eQTL) which accounts for coding gene expression based on GTEx8. Genetic associations of cognitive performance were obtained from GWAS for either: 1) general cognitive function constructed using Principal Component Analysis (N = 300,486); or, 2)gFactor constructed using genomic structural equation modelling (N = 11,263-331,679). Findings for candidate causal proteins were replicated using a separate protein GWAS in Icelanders (N = 35,559).Results:A higher concentration of genetically predicted circulatory myeloperoxidase (MPO) was nominally associated with better cognitive performance (p< 0.05) using different selection criteria for genetic instruments. Particularly, brain-specificcis-eQTL predicted MPO, which accounts for protein-coding gene expression in brain tissues, was associated with general cognitive function (βWald= 0.22, PWald= 2.4 × 10-4). The posterior probability for colocalization (PP.H4) of MPO pQTL with thegFactor was 0.577. Findings for MPO were replicated using the Icelandic GWAS. Although we did not find evidence for colocalization, we found that higher genetically predicted concentrations of cathepsin D and CD40 were associated with better cognitive performance and a higher genetically predicted concentration of CSF-1 was associated with poorer cognitive performance.Conclusion:We conclude that these proteins are involved in shared pathways between CVD and those for cognitive reserve or affecting cognitive decline, suggesting therapeutic targets able to reduce genetic risks conferred by cardiovascular disease.Copyright © 2023 Huang, Gill, Zuber, Matthews, Elliott, Tzoulaki and Dehghan."
"36857861","Therapeutic targets for inflammatory bowel disease: proteome-wide Mendelian randomization and colocalization analyses.","EBioMedicine","Identifying new drug targets for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is urgently needed. The proteome is a major source of therapeutic targets. We conducted a proteome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) and colocalization analyses to identify possible targets for IBD.Summary-level data of 4907 circulating protein levels were extracted from a large-scale protein quantitative trait loci study including 35,559 individuals. Genetic associations with IBD and its subtypes were obtained from the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Genetics Consortium (25,024 cases and 34,915 controls), the FinnGen study (7206 cases and 253,199 controls), and the UK Biobank study (7045 cases and 449,282 controls). MR analysis was conducted to estimate the associations between protein and IBD risk. The colocalization analysis was used to examine whether the identified proteins and IBD shared casual variants.Genetically predicted levels of 3, and 5 circulating proteins were associated with IBD and ulcerative colitis (UC), respectively. With high supporting evidence of colocalization, genetically predicted MST1 (macrophage stimulating 1) and HGFAC (hepatocyte growth factor activator) levels were inversely associated with IBD risks. The associations of STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3), MST1, CXCL5 (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 5), and ITPKA (inositol-trisphosphate 3-kinase A) with the risk of UC were supported by colocalization analysis.The proteome-wide MR investigation identified many proteins associated with the risk of IBD. MST1, HGFAC, STAT3, ITPKA, and CXCL5 deserve further investigation as potential therapeutic targets for IBD.SCL is supported by research grants from the Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare (Forte; grant no. 2018-00123) and the Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsrådet; grant no. 2019-00977).

"36910141","Cerebral amyloid angiopathy-related cardiac injury: Focus on cardiac cell death.","Front Cell Dev Biol","Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a kind of disease in which amyloid β (Aβ) and other amyloid protein deposits in the cerebral cortex and the small blood vessels of the brain, causing cerebrovascular and brain parenchymal damage. CAA patients are often accompanied by cardiac injury, involving Aβ, tau and transthyroxine amyloid (ATTR). Aβ is the main injury factor of CAA, which can accelerate the formation of coronary artery atherosclerosis, aortic valve osteogenesis calcification and cardiomyocytes basophilic degeneration. In the early stage of CAA (pre-stroke), the accompanying locus coeruleus (LC) amyloidosis, vasculitis and circulating Aβ will induce first hit to the heart. When the CAA progresses to an advanced stage and causes a cerebral hemorrhage, the hemorrhage leads to autonomic nervous function disturbance, catecholamine surges, and systemic inflammation reaction, which can deal the second hit to the heart. Based on the brain-heart axis, CAA and its associated cardiac injury can create a vicious cycle that accelerates the progression of each other.Copyright © 2023 Xu, Xu and Zhang."
"36904241","Intergenerational Inheritance of Hepatic Steatosis in a Mouse Model of Childhood Obesity: Potential Involvement of Germ-Line microRNAs.","Nutrients","Childhood obesity increases the risk of developing metabolic syndrome later in life. Moreover, metabolic dysfunction may be inherited into the following generation through non-genomic mechanisms, with epigenetics as a plausible candidate. The pathways involved in the development of metabolic dysfunction across generations in the context of childhood obesity remain largely unexplored. We have developed a mouse model of early adiposity by reducing litter size at birth (small litter group, SL: 4 pups/dam; control group, C: 8 pups/dam). Mice raised in small litters (SL) developed obesity, insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis with aging. Strikingly, the offspring of SL males (SL-F1) also developed hepatic steatosis. Paternal transmission of an environmentally induced phenotype strongly suggests epigenetic inheritance. We analyzed the hepatic transcriptome in C-F1 and SL-F1 mice to identify pathways involved in the development of hepatic steatosis. We found that the circadian rhythm and lipid metabolic process were the ontologies with highest significance in the liver of SL-F1 mice. We explored whether DNA methylation and small non-coding RNAs might be involved in mediating intergenerational effects. Sperm DNA methylation was largely altered in SL mice. However, these changes did not correlate with the hepatic transcriptome. Next, we analyzed small non-coding RNA content in the testes of mice from the parental generation. Two miRNAs (miR-457 and miR-201) appeared differentially expressed in the testes of SL-F0 mice. They are known to be expressed in mature spermatozoa, but not in oocytes nor early embryos, and they may regulate the transcription of lipogenic genes, but not clock genes, in hepatocytes. Hence, they are strong candidates to mediate the inheritance of adult hepatic steatosis in our murine model. In conclusion, litter size reduction leads to intergenerational effects through non-genomic mechanisms. In our model, DNA methylation does not seem to play a role on the circadian rhythm nor lipid genes. However, at least two paternal miRNAs might influence the expression of a few lipid-related genes in the first-generation offspring, F1."
"36894682","Performance on the balloon analogue risk task and anticipatory response inhibition task is associated with severity of impulse control behaviours in people with Parkinson's disease.","Exp Brain Res","Dopamine agonist medication is one of the largest risk factors for development of problematic impulse control behaviours (ICBs) in people with Parkinson's disease. The present study investigated the potential of dopamine gene profiling and individual performance on impulse control tasks to explain ICB severity. Clinical, genetic and task performance data were entered into a mixed-effects linear regression model for people with Parkinson's disease taking (n = 50) or not taking (n = 25) dopamine agonist medication. Severity of ICBs was captured via the Questionnaire for Impulsive-compulsive disorders in Parkinson's disease Rating Scale. A cumulative dopamine genetic risk score (DGRS) was calculated for each participant from variance in five dopamine-regulating genes. Objective measures of impulsive action and impulsive choice were measured on the Anticipatory Response Inhibition Task and Balloon Analogue Risk Task, respectively. For participants on dopamine agonist medication, task performance reflecting greater impulsive choice (p = 0.014), and to a trend level greater impulsive action (p = 0.056), as well as a longer history of DA medication (p < 0.001) all predicted increased ICB severity. DGRS however, did not predict ICB severity (p = 0.708). No variables could explain ICB severity in the non-agonist group. Our task-derived measures of impulse control have the potential to predict ICB severity in people with Parkinson's and warrant further investigation to determine whether they can be used to monitor ICB changes over time. The DGRS appears better suited to predicting the incidence, rather than severity, of ICBs on agonist medication.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36900791","The Mediating Effect of Central Obesity on the Association between Dietary Quality, Dietary Inflammation Level and Low-Grade Inflammation-Related Serum Inflammatory Markers in Adults.","Int J Environ Res Public Health","To date, few studies have explored the role of central obesity on the association between diet quality, measured by the health eating index (HEI), inflammatory eating index (DII), and low-grade inflammation-related serum inflammatory markers. In this paper, we use the data from the 2015-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to explore this. Dietary intakes were measured during two 24-h dietary recall interviews and using USDA Food Pattern Equivalence Database (FPED) dietary data. Serum inflammatory markers were obtained from NHANES Laboratory Data. Generalized structural equation models (GSEMs) were used to explore the mediating relationship. Central obesity plays a significant mediating role in the association between HEI-2015 and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), mediating 26.87% of the associations between the two; it also mediates 15.24% of the associations between DII and hs-CRP. Central obesity plays a mediating role in 13.98% of the associations between HEI-2015 and white blood cells (WBC); it also mediates 10.83% of the associations between DII and WBC. Our study suggests that central obesity plays a mediating role in the association of dietary quality with low-grade inflammation-related serum inflammatory markers (hs-CRP and WBC)."
"36905458","The association between adherence to a plant-based diet and cognitive ageing.","Eur J Nutr","While the benefits of adopting a more plant-based diet for sustainability and animal welfare are clear, its long-term health impacts, including the impact on cognitive ageing, are limited studied. Therefore, we investigated the associations between plant-based diet adherence and cognitive ageing.Data from a previous intervention study involving community-dwelling adults aged ≥ 65 years were analysed at baseline (n = 658) and after 2-year follow-up (n = 314). Global and domain-specific cognitive functioning were assessed at both timepoints. Overall, healthful and unhealthful plant-based dietary indices were calculated from a 190-item food frequency questionnaire. Multivariate-adjusted linear regression models were applied to test for associations.After full-adjustment, higher overall adherence to a plant-based diet was not associated with global cognitive function (difference in Z-score, tertile 1 versus 3 [95% CI]: 0.04 [- 0.05, 0.13] p = 0.40) or cognitive change (- 0.04 [- 0.11, 0.04], p = 0.35). Similarly, healthful and unhealthful plant-based diet indices were not associated with cognitive functioning (respectively p = 0.48; p = 0.87) or change (respectively p = 0.21, p = 0.33). Interestingly, we observed fish consumption to influence the association between plant-based diet adherence and cognitive functioning (p-interaction = 0.01), with only individuals with a fish consumption of ≥ 0.93 portion/week benefitting from better overall plant-based diet adherence (β per 10-point increment [95% CI]: 0.12 [0.03, 0.21] p = 0.01).We did not demonstrate associations of a more plant-based diet with cognitive ageing. However, possibly such association exists in a subpopulation with higher fish intake. This would be in line with earlier observations that diets rich in plant foods and fish, such as the Mediterranean diet, may be beneficial for cognitive ageing.Registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00696514) on June 12, 2008.© 2023.

This review considers implications for now moving clinical metagenomics into routine service, with respiratory metagenomics as the exemplar use-case.Respiratory metagenomic workflows have completed proof-of-concept, providing organism identification and many genotypic antimicrobial resistance determinants from clinical samples in <6 h. This enables rapid escalation or de-escalation of empiric therapy for patient benefit and reducing selection of antimicrobial resistance, with genomic-typing available in the same time-frame. Attention is now focussed on demonstrating clinical, health-economic, accreditation, and regulatory requirements. More fundamentally, pathogen sequencing challenges the traditional culture-orientated time frame of microbiology laboratories, which through automation and centralisation risks becoming increasingly separated from the clinical setting. It presents an alternative future where infection experts are brought together around a single genetic output in an acute timeframe, aligning the microbiology target operating model with the wider human genomic and digital strategy.Pathogen sequencing is a transformational proposition for microbiology laboratories and their infectious diseases, infection control, and public health partners. Healthcare systems that link output from routine clinical metagenomic sequencing, with pandemic and antimicrobial resistance surveillance, will create valuable tools for protecting their population against future infectious diseases threats.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

Understanding the interplay of PRS with environmental factors is critical for interpreting and applying PRS in a wide variety of settings. We develop an efficient method for simultaneously modeling gene-environment correlations and interactions using PRS in case-control studies. We use a logistic-normal regression modeling framework to specify the disease risk and PRS distribution in the underlying population and propose joint inference across the two models using the retrospective likelihood of the case-control data. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate the flexibility of the method in trading-off bias and efficiency for the estimation of various model parameters compared to the standard logistic regression or a case-only analysis for gene-environment interactions, or a control-only analysis for gene-environment correlations. Finally, using simulated case-control datasets within the UK Biobank study, we demonstrate the power of the proposed method for its ability to recover results from the full prospective cohort for the detection of an interaction between long-term oral contraceptive use and PRS on the risk of breast cancer. This method is computationally efficient and implemented in a user-friendly R package."

However, the causal association between mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) characterization and OA has not been extensively explored.Methods:Two-sample Mendelian randomization was performed to calculate the impact of mitochondrial genomic variations on overall OA as well as site-specific OA, with multiple analytical methods inverse variance weighted (IVW), weighted median (WM), MR-Egger and MR-robust adjusted profile score (MR-RAPS).Results:Genetically determined mitochondrial heteroplasmy (MtHz) and mtDNA abundance were not causally associated with overall OA. In site-specific OA analyses, the causal effect of mtDNA abundance on other OA sites, including hip, knee, thumb, hand, and finger, had not been discovered. There was a suggestively protective effect of MtHz on knee OA IVW OR = 0.632, 95% CI: 0.425-0.939,p-value = 0.023. No causal association between MtHz and other different OA phenotypes was found.Conclusion:MtHz shows potential to be a novel therapeutic target and biomarker on knee OA development. However, the variation of mtDNA abundance was measured from leukocyte in blood and the levels of MtHz were from saliva samples rather than cartilage or synovial tissues. Genotyping samples from synovial and cartilage can be a focus to further exploration.Copyright © 2023 Liu, Cai, Gong, Yang, Wang, Zhou, Yu and Li."
"36909346","Multi-omics and machine learning for the prevention and management of female reproductive health.","Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)","Females typically carry most of the burden of reproduction in mammals. In humans, this burden is exacerbated further, as the evolutionary advantage of a large and complex human brain came at a great cost of women's reproductive health. Pregnancy thus became a highly demanding phase in a woman's life cycle both physically and emotionally and therefore needs monitoring to assure an optimal outcome. Moreover, an increasing societal trend towards reproductive complications partly due to the increasing maternal age and global obesity pandemic demands closer monitoring of female reproductive health. This review first provides an overview of female reproductive biology and further explores utilization of large-scale data analysis and -omics techniques (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) towards diagnosis, prognosis, and management of female reproductive disorders. In addition, we explore machine learning approaches for predictive models towards prevention and management. Furthermore, mobile apps and wearable devices provide a promise of continuous monitoring of health. These complementary technologies can be combined towards monitoring female (fertility-related) health and detection of any early complications to provide intervention solutions. In summary, technological advances (e.g., omics and wearables) have shown a promise towards diagnosis, prognosis, and management of female reproductive disorders. Systematic integration of these technologies is needed urgently in female reproductive healthcare to be further implemented in the national healthcare systems for societal benefit.Copyright © 2023 Kharb and Joshi."
"36879894","VEXAS Syndrome in a Patient with Myeloproliferative Neoplasia.","Case Rep Hematol","VEXAS syndrome stands for vacuoles, E1 enzyme,X-linked, autoinflammatory, somatic syndrome. The syndrome is a combined hematological and rheumatological condition caused by a somatic mutation in theUBA1. There is an association between VEXAS and hematological conditions such as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), monoclonal gammopathies of uncertain conditions (MGUS), multiple myeloma (MM), and monoclonal B-cell lymphoproliferative conditions. There are not many descriptions of patients having VEXAS in combination with myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). With this article, we want to present a case history of a man in his sixties with aJAK2V617F mutated essential thrombocythemia (ET) developing VEXAS syndrome. The inflammatory symptoms occurred three and a half years after the ET diagnosis. He started to experience symptoms of autoinflammation and an overall worsening of his health, and blood work showed high inflammatory markers, leading to repeated hospitalizations. His major complaint was stiffness and pain, and high dosages of prednisolone were necessary to obtain pain relief. He subsequently developed anemia and significantly variable levels of thrombocytes, which previously were at a steady level. To evaluate his ET, we made a bone marrow smear demonstrating vacuolated myeloid and erythroid cells. Having VEXAS syndrome in mind, genetic testing identifying theUBA1gene mutation was performed, thus confirming our suspicion. The work-up with myeloid panel on his bone marrow identified genetic mutation in theDNMT3too. After developing VEXAS syndrome, he experienced thromboembolic events with both cerebral infarction and pulmonary embolism. Thromboembolic events are also common inJAK2mutated patients, but in his case, they presented first after VEXAS had developed. Throughout the course of his condition, several attempts with prednisolone tapering and steroid sparing drugs were tried. He could not get pain relief unless the combination of medications included a relatively high dose of prednisolone. Currently, the patient uses prednisolone, anagrelide, and ruxolitinib, with partial remission and fewer hospitalizations and more stabilized hemoglobin and thrombocytes.Copyright © 2023 Janne Austestad et al."

We previously identified a panel of four MESO EMT genes correlating with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and poor survival. In this study, we investigated the correlation between these MESO EMT genes, the immune profile, and the genomic and epigenomic alterations to identify potential therapeutic targets to prevent or reverse the EMT process. Using multiomic analysis, we observed that the MESO EMT genes were positively correlated with hypermethylation of epigenetic genes and loss of CDKN2A/B expression. MESO EMT genes such asCOL5A2,ITGAV,SERPINH1,CALD1,SPARC, andACTA2were associated with upregulation of TGF-β signaling, hedgehog signaling, and IL-2-STAT5 signaling and downregulation of the IFN-α and IFN-γ response. Immune checkpoints such asCTLA4,CD274(PD-L1),PDCD1LG2(PD-L2),PDCD1(PD-1), andTIGITwere upregulated, whileLAG3,LGALS9, andVTCN1were downregulated with the expression of MESO EMT genes.CD160,KIR2DL1, andKIR2DL3were also broadly downregulated with the expression of MESO EMT genes. In conclusion, we observed that the expression of a panel of MESO EMT genes was associated with hypermethylation of epigenetic genes and loss of expression ofCDKN2AandCDKN2B. Expression of MESO EMT genes was associated with downregulation of the type I and type II IFN response, loss of cytotoxicity and NK cell activity, and upregulation of specific immune checkpoints, as well as upregulation of the TGF-β1/TGFBR1 pathway."

It is complex, having a physical and a cognitive component, and it is the result of many contributing factors. Frail patients have oxidative stress and elevated proinflammatory cytokines. Frailty impairs many systems and results in a reduced physiological reserve and increased vulnerability to stress. It is related to aging and to cardiovascular diseases (CVD). There are few studies on the genetic factors of frailty, but epigenetic clocks determine age and frailty. In contrast, there is genetic overlap of frailty with cardiovascular disease and its risk factors. Frailty is not yet considered a risk factor for CVD. It is accompanied by a loss and/or poor functioning of muscle mass, which depends on fiber protein content, resulting from the balance between protein breakdown and synthesis. Bone fragility is also implied, and there is a crosstalk between adipocytes, myocytes, and bone. The identification and assessment of frailty is difficult, without there being a standard instrument to identify or treat it. Measures to prevent its progression include exercises, as well as supplementing the diet with vitamin D and K, calcium, and testosterone. In conclusion, more research is needed to better understand frailty and to avoid complications in CVD."

Switching from pro-inflammatory lipid mediators (PIMs) to specialized pro-resolving (SPMs) is a critical step toward acute inflammation resolution and preventing chronic inflammation. Although the biosynthetic pathways and enzymes for PIMs and SPMs have now been largely identified, the actual transcriptional profiles underlying the immune cell type-specific transcriptional profiles of these mediators are still unknown. Using the Atlas of Inflammation Resolution, we created a large network of gene regulatory interactions linked to the biosynthesis of SPMs and PIMs. By mapping single-cell sequencing data, we identified cell type-specific gene regulatory networks of the lipid mediator biosynthesis. Using machine learning approaches combined with network features, we identified cell clusters of similar transcriptional regulation and demonstrated how specific immune cell activation affects PIM and SPM profiles. We found substantial differences in regulatory networks in related cells, accounting for network-based preprocessing in functional single-cell analyses. Our results not only provide further insight into the gene regulation of lipid mediators in the immune response but also shed light on the contribution of selected cell types in their biosynthesis."

Exploiting the specificity of these molecules has allowed for the genetic dissection of CA2 structure and function in transgenic mice. With this change in criteria, the anatomical boundaries of the CA2 have expanded across the hippocampal axis but the CA2's full rostrocaudal extent is not consistently delineated across atlases. The Hippocampus Gene Expression Atlas (HGEA) provides a comprehensive map of 20 gene expression domains across the entire mouse hippocampus including the CA2.

Synaptic connectivity rules powerfully shape how each cell type participates in the cortical circuit, but comprehensively mapping connectivity at the resolution of distinct cell types remains difficult. Here, we used millimeter-scale volumetric electron microscopy to investigate the connectivity of inhibitory neurons across a dense neuronal population spanning all layers of mouse visual cortex with synaptic resolution. We classified all 1183 excitatory neurons within a 100 micron column into anatomical subclasses using quantitative morphological and synapse features based on full dendritic reconstructions, finding both familiar subclasses corresponding to axonal projections and novel intralaminar distinctions based on synaptic properties. To relate these subclasses to single-cell connectivity, we reconstructed all 164 inhibitory interneurons in the same column, producing a wiring diagram of inhibition with more than 70,000 synapses. We found widespread cell-type-specific inhibition, including interneurons selectively targeting certain excitatory subpopulations among spatially intermingled neurons in layer 2/3, layer 5, and layer 6. Globally, inhibitory connectivity was organized into ""motif groups,"" heterogeneous collections of cells that collectively target both perisomatic and dendritic compartments of the same combinations of excitatory subtypes. We also discovered a novel category of disinhibitory-specialist interneuron that preferentially targets basket cells. Collectively, our analysis revealed new organizing principles for cortical inhibition and will serve as a powerful foundation for linking modern multimodal neuronal atlases with the cortical wiring diagram."

This review aims to update the recent findings on COVID-19 infections from an epigenetic scenario and develop future perspectives of epi-drugs to treat the disease.Original research articles and review studies related to COVID-19 were searched and analyzed from the Google Scholar/PubMed/Medline databases mainly between 2019 and 2022 to brief the recent work.Numerous in-depth studies of the mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 have been going on to minimize the consequences of the viral outburst. Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 receptors and Transmembrane serine protease 2 facilitate viral entry to the host cells. Upon internalization, it uses the host machinery to replicate viral copies and alter the downstream regulation of the normal cells, causing infection-related morbidities and mortalities. In addition, several epigenetic regulations such as DNA methylation, acetylation, histone modifications, microRNA, and other factors (age, sex, etc.) are responsible for the regulations of viral entry, its immune evasion, and cytokine responses also play a major modulatory role in COVID-19 severity, which has been discussed in detail in this review.Findings of epigenetic regulation of viral pathogenicity open a new window for epi-drugs as a possible therapeutical approach against COVID-19.© 2023.

"36798305","Deletion of transglutaminase 2 from astrocytes significantly improves their ability to promote neurite outgrowth on an inhibitory matrix.","bioRxiv","Astrocytes are the primary support cells of the central nervous system (CNS) that help maintain the energetic requirements and homeostatic environment of neurons. CNS injury causes astrocytes to take on reactive phenotypes with altered overall function that can range from supportive to harmful for recovering neurons. The characterization of reactive astrocyte populations is a rapidly developing field, and the underlying factors and signaling pathways governing which type of reactive phenotype that astrocytes take on is poorly understood. Our previous studies suggest that transglutaminase 2 (TG2) has an important role in determining the astrocytic response to injury. TG2 is upregulated in astrocytes across multiple injury models, and selectively deleting TG2 from astrocytes improves functional outcomes after CNS injury and causes widespread changes in gene regulation, which is associated with its nuclear localization. The underlying molecular mechanisms by which TG2 causes these functional changes are unknown, and its interactions in the nucleus of astrocytes has not yet been described. To begin to understand how TG2 impacts astrocytic function, we used a neuron-astrocyte co-culture paradigm to compare the effects of TG2-/- and wild type (WT) astrocytes on neurite outgrowth and synapse formation. We assayed neurons on both a growth-supportive substrate and an injury-simulating matrix comprised of inhibitory chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs). Compared to WT astrocytes, TG2-/- astrocytes supported neurite outgrowth to a significantly greater extent only on the CSPG matrix, while synapse formation assays showed mixed results depending on the pre- and post-synaptic markers analyzed. We hypothesize that TG2 regulates the supportive functions of astrocytes in injury conditions by modulating the expression of a wide range of genes through interactions with transcription factors and transcription complexes. Based on results of a previous yeast two-hybrid screen for TG2 interactors, we further investigated the interaction of TG2 with Zbtb7a, a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor. Coimmunoprecipitation and colocalization analyses confirmed the interaction of TG2 and Zbtb7a in the nucleus of astrocytes. Genetic overexpression or knockdown of Zbtb7a levels in TG2-/- and WT astrocytes revealed that Zbtb7a robustly influenced astrocytic morphology and the ability of astrocytes to support neuronal outgrowth, which was significantly modulated by the presence of TG2. These findings support our hypothesis that astrocytic TG2 acts as a transcriptional regulator to influence astrocytic function, with greater influence under injury conditions that increase its expression, and Zbtb7a likely contributes to the overall effects observed with astrocytic TG2 deletion."

Furthermore, we performed a bi-directional MR analysis to examine the direction of the causal relations.We identified 11 causal relationships between genetic liability in the gut microbiome and cancer, including those involving the genus Bifidobacterium. We found 17 strong associations between genetic liability in the gut microbiome and cancer. Moreover, we found 24 associations between genetic liability in the gut microbiome and cancer using multiple datasets.Our MR analysis revealed that the gut microbiota was causally associated with cancers and may be useful in providing new insights for further mechanistic and clinical studies of microbiota-mediated cancer.© 2023.

Previous studies have revealed various risk factors associated with alopecia. However, the relationship between leukocyte telomere length (LTL) and non-scarring alopecia remains unclear.A two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed to evaluate the causality between genetically predicted LTL and the risk of non-scarring alopecia. MR analyses were performed using the inverse variance-weighted (IVW) method and complemented with other MR methods.The summary statistics of the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for AGA and AA were obtained from the FinnGen biobank, which included 119,185 and 211,428 individuals, respectively. A total of 126 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with genome-wide significance were selected as the instrumental variables for LTL. The MR analyses suggested a causal relationship between LTL and AGA, and the risk of AGA increased by 3.19 times as the genetically predicted LTL was shortened by one standard deviation in log transformed form under the IVW method (OR = 4.19, 95% CI = 1.20-14.61,p = 0.024). The other MR methods also demonstrated a similar trend of the effect of LTL on AGA. There was no causal relationship between LTL and AA (p > 0.05). Sensitivity analyses further demonstrated that the current results were less likely to be affected by confounders and bias.Our results suggested a potential causal relationship between LTL and AGA, and shortened LTL was associated with an increased risk of AGA.Copyright © 2023 Li, Yang, Liao, Zheng, Li, Wei, Liu and Yang."

It is urgent to develop effective methods to control soil heavy metal pollution. Phytoremediation has advantages and potential for soil heavy metal pollution control. However, the current hyperaccumulators have the disadvantages of poor environmental adaptability, single enrichment species and small biomass. Based on the concept of modularity, synthetic biology makes it possible to design a wide range of organisms. In this paper, a comprehensive strategy of ""microbial biosensor detection - phytoremediation - heavy metal recovery"" for soil heavy metal pollution control was proposed, and the required steps were modified by using synthetic biology methods. This paper summarizes the new experimental methods that promote the discovery of synthetic biological elements and the construction of circuits, and combs the methods of producing transgenic plants to facilitate the transformation of constructed synthetic biological vectors. Finally, the problems that should be paid more attention to in the remediation of soil heavy metal pollution based on synthetic biology were discussed.Copyright © 2023 Bai, Han and Feng."
"36814440","Predicting IHC staining classes of NF1 using features in the hematoxylin channel.","J Pathol Inform","Immunohistochemistry (IHC) highlights specific cell types in tissues and traditionally involves antibody staining together with a hematoxylin counterstain. The intensity and pattern of hematoxylin staining differs between cell types and reveals morphological characteristics of cells. Here, we propose that features in the hematoxylin stain can be used to predict IHC labels, such as Neurofibromin (encoded by the geneNF1). The dataset consists of 7.2 million cells from benign and kidney cancer cores in a tissue microarray. Morphology and hematoxylin (H&M) features defined within QuPath are subjected to a clustering analysis in CytoMap. H&M features are also used to train 4 different XGBoost models to predict high, low, and negative NF1 stain classes in benign renal tubules, clear cell (ccRCC), papillary (PRCC), and chromophobe (ChRCC) renal carcinoma. The prediction accuracies of NF1 staining classes in benign, ccRCC, ChRCC, and PRCC range between 70% and 90% with areas under the precision recall curve PRAUCNF1-high= 0.82+0.12, PRAUCNF1-low= 0.62+0.25, and PRAUCNF1-negative= 0.83+0.16. The most important feature for predicting the NF1 class involves the minimum cellular hematoxylin staining intensity. Together, these results demonstrate the feasibility to predict NF1 expression solely from features in hematoxylin staining using open source software. Since the hematoxylin features can be obtained from regular H&E and IHC slides, the proposed workflow has broad applicability.© 2023 The Authors."

The shared clinical features are chronic progressive decline of motor, cognitive, and behavioral functions. These disorders include Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy body, and multiple system atrophy. Vigorous research in the mechanisms of pathology of these illnesses is currently under way to find disease-modifying treatment and molecular markers for early diagnosis. α-Synuclein is a prone-to-aggregate, small amyloidogenic protein with multiple roles in synaptic vesicle trafficking, neurotransmitter release, and intracellular signaling events. Its expression is controlled by several mechanisms, one of which is epigenetic regulation. When transmitted to the nucleus, α-synuclein binds to DNA and histones and participates in epigenetic regulatory functions controlling specific gene transcription. Here, we discuss the various aspects of α-synuclein involvement in epigenetic regulation in health and diseases."

Decades of research has focused on the role of type I interferons in antiviral immunity and ensuing airway diseases, however, recent findings have highlighted several novel aspects of the interferon response that merit further investigation. In this perspective, we discuss emerging roles of type I interferons in the pathogenesis of sLRI in children. We propose that variations in interferon response patterns exist as discrete endotypes, which operate locally in the airways and systemically through a lung-blood-bone marrow axis. We discuss new insights into the role of interferons in immune training, bacterial lysate immunotherapy, and allergen-specific immunotherapy. Interferons play complex and diverse roles in the pathogenesis of sLRI and later asthma, providing new directions for mechanistic studies and drug development.Copyright © 2023 Bosco."

Since the introduction ofScophthalmus maximus, the scale of breeding has continued to expand, during which diseases caused by various bacteria, viruses and parasites have become increasingly serious. Therefore, the inactivated vaccines have been widely researched and used in the field of aquatic products with its unique advantages. However, the immune mechanism that occurred in turbot after immunization with inactivated vaccine ofAeromonas salmonicidawas not clear.In this study, differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were screened by Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS) and significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened by Transcriptome sequencing. Double luciferase report assay and DNA pull-down assay were further verified the DNA methylation state of the gene promoter region affected genes transcriptional activity after immunization with inactivated vaccine ofAeromonas salmonicida.A total of 8149 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were screened, in which there were many immune-related genes with altered DNA methylation status. Meanwhile, 386 significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, many of which were significantly enriched in Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway and C-type lectin receptor signaling pathway. Combined analysis of WGBS results and RNA-seq results, a total of 9 DMRs of negatively regulated genes are located in the promoter region, including 2 hypermethylated genes with lower expression and 7 hypomethylated genes with higher expression. Then, two immune-related genes C5a anaphylatoxin chemotactic receptor 1-like (C5ar1-Like) and Eosinophil peroxidase-like(EPX-Like), were screened to explore the regulation mechanism of DNA methylation modification on their expression level. Moreover, the DNA methylation state of the gene promoter region affected genes transcriptional activity by inhibiting the binding of transcription factors, which lead to changes in the expression level of the gene.We jointly analyzed WGBS and RNA-seq results and revealed the immune mechanism that occurred in turbot after immunized with inactivated vaccine ofA. salmonicidafrom the perspective of DNA methylation.Copyright © 2023 Li, Su, Liu, Guo, Zhou and Xiu."

Currently, it is unknown whether intravesical BCG application induces trained immunity.The aim of this research was to determine whether BCG immunotherapy induces trained immunity in NMIBC patients. We conducted a prospective observational cohort study in 17 NMIBC patients scheduled for BCG therapy and measured trained immunity parameters at 9 time points before and during a 1-year BCG maintenance regimen. Ex vivo cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells, epigenetic modifications, and changes in the monocyte transcriptome were measured. The frequency of respiratory infections was investigated in two larger cohorts of BCG-treated and non-BCG treated NMIBC patients as a surrogate measurement of trained immunity. Gene-based association analysis of genetic variants in candidate trained immunity genes and their association with recurrence-free survival and progression-free survival after BCG therapy was performed to investigate the hypothesized link between trained immunity and clinical response.We found that intravesical BCG does induce trained immunity based on an increased production of TNF and IL-1β after heterologous ex vivo stimulation of circulating monocytes 6-12 weeks after intravesical BCG treatment; and a 37% decreased risk (OR 0.63 (95% CI 0.40 to 1.01)) for respiratory infections in BCG-treated versus non-BCG-treated NMIBC patients. An epigenomics approach combining chromatin immuno precipitation-sequencing and RNA-sequencing with in vitro trained immunity experiments identified enhanced inflammasome activity in BCG-treated individuals. Finally, germline variation in genes that affect trained immunity was associated with recurrence and progression after BCG therapy in NMIBC.We conclude that BCG immunotherapy induces trained immunity in NMIBC patients and this may account for the protective effects against respiratory infections. The data of our gene-based association analysis suggest that a link between trained immunity and oncological outcome may exist. Future studies should further investigate how trained immunity affects the antitumor immune responses in BCG-treated NMIBC patients.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

A key prerequisite for effective implementation of precision oncology is the development of companion biomarkers that can predict response to anti-cancer therapies and guide patient selection for clinical trials and/or treatment. However, reliable predictive biomarkers are currently lacking for many anti-cancer therapies, hampering their clinical application. Here, we developed a novel machine learning-based framework to derive predictive multi-gene biomarker panels and associated expression signatures that accurately predict cancer drug sensitivity. We demonstrated the power of the approach by applying it to identify response biomarker panels for an Hsp90-based therapy in prostate cancer, using proteomic data profiled from prostate cancer patient-derived explants. Our approach employs a rational feature section strategy to maximise model performance, and innovatively utilizes Boolean algebra methods to derive specific expression signatures of the marker proteins. Given suitable data for model training, the approach is also applicable to other cancer drug agents in different tumour settings.Copyright © 2023 Shin, Centenera, Hodgson, Nguyen, Butler, Daly and Nguyen."
"36900079","Precision Medicine for Chronic Endometritis: Computer-Aided Diagnosis Using Deep Learning Model.","Diagnostics (Basel)","Chronic endometritis (CE) is a localized mucosal infectious and inflammatory disorder marked by infiltration of CD138(+) endometrial stromal plasmacytes (ESPC). CE is drawing interest in the field of reproductive medicine because of its association with female infertility of unknown etiology, endometriosis, repeated implantation failure, recurrent pregnancy loss, and multiple maternal/newborn complications. The diagnosis of CE has long relied on somewhat painful endometrial biopsy and histopathologic examinations combined with immunohistochemistry for CD138 (IHC-CD138). With IHC-CD138 only, CE may be potentially over-diagnosed by misidentification of endometrial epithelial cells, which constitutively express CD138, as ESPCs. Fluid hysteroscopy is emerging as an alternative, less-invasive diagnostic tool that can visualize the whole uterine cavity in real-time and enables the detection of several unique mucosal findings associated with CE. The biases in the hysteroscopic diagnosis of CE; however, are the inter-observer and intra-observer disagreements on the interpretation of the endoscopic findings. Additionally, due to the variances in the study designs and adopted diagnostic criteria, there exists some dissociation in the histopathologic and hysteroscopic diagnosis of CE among researchers. To address these questions, novel dual immunohistochemistry for CD138 and another plasmacyte marker multiple myeloma oncogene 1 are currently being tested. Furthermore, computer-aided diagnosis using a deep learning model is being developed for more accurate detection of ESPCs. These approaches have the potential to contribute to the reduction in human errors and biases, the improvement of the diagnostic performance of CE, and the establishment of unified diagnostic criteria and standardized clinical guidelines for the disease."

First, the coding sequence (CDS) ofTSSK1Bwas cloned by RT-PCR, and bioinformatics analysis was conducted with relevant software. Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) was employed to detect the expression profile ofTSSK1Bin various tissues of male adult yaks, the spatiotemporal expression ofTSSK1Bin different stages of yak testes, and the differential expression ofTSSK1Bbetween yak and cattle-yak testes. The cellular localization ofTSSK1Bwas determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Furthermore, the methylation status of theTSSK1Bpromoter region was analyzed by bisulfite-sequencing PCR (BSP). The results showed thatTSSK1Bwas 1235 bp long, including 1104 bp of the CDS region, which encoded 367 amino acids. It was a conserved gene sharing the highest homology withBos mutus(99.67%). In addition, the bioinformatics analysis revealed that TSSK1B was an unstable hydrophilic protein mainly containing the alpha helix of 34.06% and a random coil of 44.41%, with a transmembrane structure of 29 amino acids long. The RT-qPCR results demonstrated thatTSSK1Bwas specifically expressed in yak testes compared with that in other tissues and especially highly expressed in adult yak testes. On the contrary,TSSK1Bwas hardly expressed in the testis of adult cattle-yak. IHC confirmed thatTSSK1Bprotein was more strongly expressed in the testes of adult yaks than in their fetal and juvenile counterparts. Interestingly, nearly no expression was observed in the testes of cattle-yak compared with the corresponding testes of yak. Bisulfite-sequencing PCR (BSP) revealed that the methylated CpG sites in theTSSK1Bpromoter region of cattle-yak was significantly higher than that in the yak. Taken together, this study revealed thatTSSK1Bwas specifically expressed in yak testes and highly expressed upon sexual maturity. Moreover, the rare expression in cattle-yak may be related to the hypermethylation of the promoter region, thereby providing a basis for further studies on the regulatory mechanism ofTSSK1Bin male cattle-yak sterility."

Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, including stomach, liver, esophageal, pancreatic, and colorectal cancers, represent more than a quarter of all cancers. While smoking and alcohol use are the risk factors most commonly associated with cancer development, a growing consensus also includes dietary habits as relevant risk factors for GI cancers. Current evidence suggests that socioeconomic development results in several lifestyle modifications, including shifts in dietary habits from local traditional diets to less-healthy Western diets. Moreover, recent data indicate that increased production and consumption of processed foods underlies the current pandemics of obesity and related metabolic disorders, which are directly or indirectly associated with the emergence of various chronic noncommunicable conditions and GI cancers. However, environmental changes are not restricted to dietary patterns, and unhealthy behavioral features should be analyzed with a holistic view of lifestyle. In this review, we discussed the epidemiological aspects, gut dysbiosis, and cellular and molecular characteristics of GI cancers and explored the impact of unhealthy behaviors, diet, and physical activity on developing GI cancers in the context of progressive societal changes."

Some of the oncogenic proteins in the cytoplasm and cell membranes, which are considered to promote the proliferation and migration of tumor cells, may inversely act as tumor-suppressing proteins in the extracellular domain. Furthermore, the action of tumor-secreted proteins by aggressive ""super-fit"" tumor cells can be different from those derived from ""less-fit"" tumor cells. Tumor cells that are exposed to chemotherapeutic agents could alter their secretory proteomes. Super-fit tumor cells tend to secrete tumor-suppressing proteins, while less-fit or chemotherapeutic agent-treated tumor cells may secrete tumor-promotive proteomes. Interestingly, proteomes derived from nontumor cells such as mesenchymal stem cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells mostly share common features with tumor cell-derived proteomes in response to certain signals.

"36755342","Exploiting RIG-I-like receptor pathway for cancer immunotherapy.","J Hematol Oncol","RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) are intracellular pattern recognition receptors that detect viral or bacterial infection and induce host innate immune responses. The RLRs family comprises retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I), melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2) that have distinctive features. These receptors not only recognize RNA intermediates from viruses and bacteria, but also interact with endogenous RNA such as the mislocalized mitochondrial RNA, the aberrantly reactivated repetitive or transposable elements in the human genome. Evasion of RLRs-mediated immune response may lead to sustained infection, defective host immunity and carcinogenesis. Therapeutic targeting RLRs may not only provoke anti-infection effects, but also induce anticancer immunity or sensitize ""immune-cold"" tumors to immune checkpoint blockade. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of RLRs signaling and discuss the rationale for therapeutic targeting RLRs in cancer. We describe how RLRs can be activated by synthetic RNA, oncolytic viruses, viral mimicry and radio-chemotherapy, and how the RNA agonists of RLRs can be systemically delivered in vivo. The integration of RLRs agonism with RNA interference or CAR-T cells provides new dimensions that complement cancer immunotherapy. Moreover, we update the progress of recent clinical trials for cancer therapy involving RLRs activation and immune modulation. Further studies of the mechanisms underlying RLRs signaling will shed new light on the development of cancer therapeutics.

Intestinal innate immunity is enacted by neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs), and innate lymphoid cells and NK cells, characterized by their capacity to produce a rapid and nonspecific reaction as a first-line response. Innate immune cells (IIC) defend against pathogens and excessive entry of intestinal microorganisms, while preserving immune tolerance to resident intestinal microbiota. Changes to this equilibrium are linked to intestinal inflammation in the gut and IBD. IICs mediate host defense responses, inflammation, and tissue healing by producing cytokines and chemokines, activating the complement cascade and phagocytosis, or presenting antigens to activate the adaptive immune response. IICs exert important functions that promote or ameliorate the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie and sustain IBD.

Folic acid is a key vitamin in the production and modification of DNA, and prenatal folic acid intake is known to reduce the risk of childhood leukemia. We characterized the one-carbon (folate) metabolism nutrients that may influence risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) among 122 cases diagnosed at age 0-14 years during 1988-2011 and 122 controls matched on sex, age, and race/ethnicity. Using hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) applied to neonatal dried blood spots, we evaluated 11 folate pathway metabolites, overall and by sex, race/ethnicity, and age at diagnosis. To conduct the prediction analyses, the 244 samples were separated into learning (75%) and test (25%) sets, maintaining the matched pairings. The learning set was used to train classification methods which were evaluated on the test set. High classification error rates indicate that the folate pathway metabolites measured have little predictive capacity for pediatric ALL. In conclusion, the one-carbon metabolism nutrients measured at birth were unable to predict subsequent leukemia in children. These negative findings are reflective of the last weeks of pregnancy and our study does not address the impact of these nutrients at the time of conception or during the first trimester of pregnancy that are critical for the embryo's DNA methylation programming."

The current paper summarizes findings on brain adaptations associated with seasonal changes, factors that contribute to individual differences and their implications for psychiatric disorders. Changes in circadian rhythms are likely to prominently mediate these seasonal effects since light strongly entrains the internal clock modifying brain function. Inability of circadian rhythms to accommodate to seasonal changes might increase the risk for mood and behavior problems as well as worse clinical outcomes in psychiatric disorders. Understanding the mechanisms that account for inter-individual variations in seasonality is relevant to the development of individualized prevention and treatment for psychiatric disorders. Despite promising findings, seasonal effects are still understudied and only controlled as a covariate in most brain research. Rigorous neuroimaging studies with thoughtful experimental designs, powered sample sizes and high temporal resolution alongside deep characterization of the environment are needed to better understand the seasonal adaptions of the human brain as a function of age, sex, and geographic latitude and to investigate the mechanisms underlying the alterations in seasonal adaptation in psychiatric disorders.© 2023.

Through molecular and genetic analyses, we now demonstrate that the chromatin protein HP1α plays a key role in these transcriptional repressions of both the circadian clock (CC) genes and their cognate output genes (CCGs). We show that these CC repressors recruit the HP1α protein downstream from a repressive cascade, and that this recruitment is mandatory for the maintenance of both the CC integrity and the expression of the circadian genes. We further show that the presence of HP1α is critical for both the repressor-induced chromatin compaction and the generation of ""transcriptionally repressed biomolecular hydrophobic condensates"" and demonstrates that HP1α is mandatory within the CC output genes for both the recruitment of DNA methylating enzymes on the intronic deoxyCpG islands and their subsequent methylation."
