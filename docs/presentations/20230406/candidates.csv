"37014915","Systematic comparison of unilamellar vesicles reveals that archaeal core lipid membranes are more permeable than bacterial membranes.","PLoS Biol","One of the deepest branches in the tree of life separates the Archaea from the Bacteria. These prokaryotic groups have distinct cellular systems including fundamentally different phospholipid membrane bilayers. This dichotomy has been termed the lipid divide and possibly bestows different biophysical and biochemical characteristics on each cell type. Classic experiments suggest that bacterial membranes (formed from lipids extracted from Escherichia coli, for example) show permeability to key metabolites comparable to archaeal membranes (formed from lipids extracted from Halobacterium salinarum), yet systematic analyses based on direct measurements of membrane permeability are absent. Here, we develop a new approach for assessing the membrane permeability of approximately 10 μm unilamellar vesicles, consisting of an aqueous medium enclosed by a single lipid bilayer. Comparing the permeability of 18 metabolites demonstrates that diether glycerol-1-phosphate lipids with methyl branches, often the most abundant membrane lipids of sampled archaea, are permeable to a wide range of compounds useful for core metabolic networks, including amino acids, sugars, and nucleobases. Permeability is significantly lower in diester glycerol-3-phosphate lipids without methyl branches, the common building block of bacterial membranes. To identify the membrane characteristics that determine permeability, we use this experimental platform to test a variety of lipid forms bearing a diversity of intermediate characteristics. We found that increased membrane permeability is dependent on both the methyl branches on the lipid tails and the ether bond between the tails and the head group, both of which are present on the archaeal phospholipids. These permeability differences must have had profound effects on the cell physiology and proteome evolution of early prokaryotic forms. To explore this further, we compare the abundance and distribution of transmembrane transporter-encoding protein families present on genomes sampled from across the prokaryotic tree of life. These data demonstrate that archaea tend to have a reduced repertoire of transporter gene families, consistent with increased membrane permeation. These results demonstrate that the lipid divide demarcates a clear difference in permeability function with implications for understanding some of the earliest transitions in cell origins and evolution.Copyright: © 2023 Łapińska et al.

"37014508","Molecular characterisation defines clinically-actionable heterogeneity within Group 4 medulloblastoma and improves disease risk-stratification.","Acta Neuropathol","Group 4 tumours (MBGrp4) represent the majority of non-WNT/non-SHH medulloblastomas. Their clinical course is poorly predicted by current risk-factors. MBGrp4molecular substructures have been identified (e.g. subgroups/cytogenetics/mutations), however their inter-relationships and potential to improve clinical sub-classification and risk-stratification remain undefined. We comprehensively characterised the paediatric MBGrp4molecular landscape and determined its utility to improve clinical management. A clinically-annotated discovery cohort (n = 362 MBGrp4) was assembled from UK-CCLG institutions and SIOP-UKCCSG-PNET3, HIT-SIOP-PNET4 and PNET HR + 5 clinical trials. Molecular profiling was undertaken, integrating driver mutations, second-generation non-WNT/non-SHH subgroups (1-8) and whole-chromosome aberrations (WCAs). Survival models were derived for patients ≥ 3 years of age who received contemporary multi-modal therapies (n = 323). We first independently derived and validated a favourable-risk WCA group (WCA-FR) characterised by ≥ 2 features from chromosome 7 gain, 8 loss, and 11 loss. Remaining patients were high-risk (WCA-HR). Subgroups 6 and 7 were enriched for WCA-FR (p < 0·0001) and aneuploidy. Subgroup 8 was defined by predominantly balanced genomes with isolated isochromosome 17q (p < 0·0001). While no mutations were associated with outcome and overall mutational burden was low, WCA-HR harboured recurrent chromatin remodelling mutations (p = 0·007). Integration of methylation and WCA groups improved risk-stratification models and outperformed established prognostication schemes. Our MBGrp4risk-stratification scheme defines: favourable-risk (non-metastatic disease and (i) subgroup 7 or (ii) WCA-FR (21% of patients, 5-year PFS 97%)), very-high-risk (metastatic disease with WCA-HR (36%, 5-year PFS 49%)) and high-risk (remaining patients; 43%, 5-year PFS 67%). These findings validated in an independent MBGrp4cohort (n = 668). Importantly, our findings demonstrate that previously established disease-wide risk-features (i.e. LCA histology and MYC(N) amplification) have little prognostic relevance in MBGrp4disease. Novel validated survival models, integrating clinical features, methylation and WCA groups, improve outcome prediction and re-define risk-status for ~ 80% of MBGrp4. Our MBGrp4favourable-risk group has MBWNT-like excellent outcomes, thereby doubling the proportion of medulloblastoma patients who could benefit from therapy de-escalation approaches, aimed at reducing treatment induced late-effects while sustaining survival outcomes. Novel approaches are urgently required for the very-high-risk patients.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37013004","Databases and prospects of dynamic gene regulation in eukaryotes: A mini review.","Comput Struct Biotechnol J","In eukaryotes, dynamic regulation enables DNA polymerases to catalyze a variety of RNA products in spatial and temporal patterns. Dynamic gene expression is regulated by transcription factors (TFs) and epigenetics (DNA methylation and histone modification). The applications of biochemical technology and high-throughput sequencing enhance the understanding of mechanisms of these regulations and affected genomic regions. To provide a searchable platform for retrieving such metadata, numerous databases have been developed based on the integration of genome-wide maps (e.g., ChIP-seq, whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, DNase-seq, and MNase-seq data) and functionally genomic annotation. In this mini review, we summarize the main functions of TF-related databases and outline the prevalent approaches used in inferring epigenetic regulations, their associated genes, and functions. We review the literature on crosstalk between TF and epigenetic regulation and the properties of non-coding RNA regulation, which are challenging topics that promise to pave the way for advances in database development.© 2023 The Authors."
"37010025","Detection of CpG methylation level using methyl-CpG-binding domain-fused fluorescent protein.","Anal Methods","Methylation of cytosine to 5-methylcytosine on CpG dinucleotides is the most frequently studied epigenetic modification involved in the regulation of gene expression. In normal tissues, tissue-specific CpG methylation patterns are established during development. In contrast, alterations in methylation patterns have been observed in abnormal cells, such as cancer cells. Cancer type-specific CpG methylation patterns have been identified and used as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis. In this study, we developed a hybridization-based CpG methylation level sensing system using a methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD)-fused fluorescent protein. In this system, the target DNA is captured by a complementary methylated probe DNA. When the target DNA is methylated, a symmetrically methylated CpG is formed in the double-stranded DNA. MBD specifically recognizes symmetrical methyl-CpG on double-stranded DNA; therefore, the methylation level is quantified by measuring the fluorescence intensity of the bound MBD-fused fluorescent protein. We prepared MBD-fused AcGFP1 and quantified the CpG methylation levels of the target DNA againstSEPT9,BRCA1, and long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1) using MBD-AcGFP1. This detection principle can be applied to the simultaneous and genome-wide modified base detection systems using microarrays coupled with modified base binding proteins fused to fluorescent proteins."
"37004583","Utility of genome-wide DNA methylation profiling for pediatric-type diffuse gliomas.","Brain Tumor Pathol","Despite the current progress of treatment, pediatric-type diffuse glioma is one of the most lethal primary malignant tumors in the central nervous system (CNS). Since pediatric-type CNS tumors are rare disease entities and highly heterogeneous, the diagnosis is challenging. An accurate diagnosis is essential for the choice of optimal treatment, which leads to precision oncology and improvement of the patient's outcome. Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling recently emerged as one of the most important tools for the diagnosis of CNS tumors, and the utility of this novel assay has been reported in both pediatric and adult patients. In the current World Health Organization classification published in 2021, several new entities are recognized in pediatric-type diffuse gliomas, some of which require methylation profiling. In this review, we investigated the utility of genome-wide DNA methylation profiling in pediatric-type diffuse glioma, as well as issues in the clinical application of this assay. Furthermore, the combination of genome-wide DNA methylation profiling and other comprehensive genomic assays, which may improve diagnostic accuracy and detection of the actionable target, will be discussed.© 2023.

"37001402","Placental ischemia disrupts DNA methylation patterns in distal regulatory regions in rats.","Life Sci","Preeclampsia (PE) is a leading cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality worldwide. However, the impact of PE on the organization of the functional architecture of the placental methylome remains largely unknown. We performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of placental DNA and applied a Hidden Markov Model to investigate epigenome-wide alterations in functional structures, including partially methylated domains (PMDs), low-methylated regions (LMRs), and unmethylated regions (UMRs), in a reduced uterine perfusion pressure (RUPP) rat model of PE. The remarkable similarity we observed between the rat and human placental DNA methylomes suggests that the RUPP rat model is appropriate to elucidate the epigenetic mechanisms underlying human PE. The notable changes in PMDs indicate RUPP-induced perturbation of the stressed placental methylome. This was probably regulated via modulation of the epigenetic modifier expression, including significant downregulation of Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a and upregulation of Tet2. More importantly, changes in RUPP-induced DNA methylation occurred predominately in LMRs (80 %), which represent active enhancers, rather than in canonical UMRs (3 %), which represent promoters, suggesting that placental ischemia disrupts enhancer DNA methylation. Our findings emphasize the role of enhancer methylation in response to PE, corroborating discoveries in human PE studies. We suggest paying more attention to enhancer regions in future studies on PE.Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier Inc."
"36999566","Analysis of global DNA methylation changes in human keratinocytes immediately following exposure to a 900 MHz radiofrequency field.","Bioelectromagnetics","The increasing use of nonionizing radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMFs) in a wide range of technologies necessitates studies to further understanding of biological effects from exposures to such forms of electromagnetic fields. While previous studies have described mechanisms for cellular changes occurring following exposure to low-intensity RF-EMFs, the role of molecular epigenetics has not been thoroughly investigated. Specifically unresolved is the effect of RF-EMFs on deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation, which is a powerful epigenetic process, used by cells to regulate gene expression. DNA methylation is dynamic and can be rapidly triggered in response to external stimuli such as exposure to RF-EMFs. In the present study, we performed a global analysis of DNA methylation patterns in human keratinocytes exposed to 900 MHz RF-EMFs for 1 h at a low dose rate (estimated mean specific absorption rate (SAR) < 10 mW/kg). We used a custom system to allow stable exposure of cell cultures to RF-EMFs under biologically relevant conditions (37 °C, 5% CO2, 95% humidity). We performed whole genome bisulfite sequencing directly following RF-EMF exposure to examine the immediate changes in DNA methylation patterns and identify early differentially methylated genes in RF-EMF-exposed keratinocytes. By correlating global gene expression to whole genome bisulfite sequencing, we identified six common targets that were both differentially methylated and differentially expressed in response to RF-EMF exposure. The results highlight a potential epigenetic role in the cellular response to RF-EMFs. Particularly, the six identified targets may potentially be developed as epigenetic biomarkers for immediate responses to RF-EMF exposure.

The involvement of IKBIP in the growth of tumors has only been discussed in a small number of publications.Purpose:To explore the role that IKBIP plays in the development of a wide variety of neoplasms, as well as the tumor immunological microenvironment.Methods:UALCAN, HPA, Genotype Tissue Expression, Cancer Genome Maps, and other datasets were used to analyze IKBIP expression. We thoroughly investigated the predictive importance of IKBIP in pan-cancer, clinical traits, and genetic anomalies. We studied whether there is a link between IKBIP and immune-related genes, microsatellite instability (MSI), and the incidence of tumor mutational burden (TMB). The link between immune cell infiltration and IKBIP expression was examined using data on immune cell infiltration from ImmuCellAI, TIMER2, and earlier studies. Finally, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to determine the signaling pathways associated with IKBIP.Results:IKBIP is highly expressed in most cancers and is negatively associated with the prognosis of several major cancer types. Furthermore, IKBIP expression was linked to TMB in 13 cancers and MSI in seven cancers. Additionally, IKBIP is associated with numerous immunological and cancer-promoting pathways. Simultaneously, various cancer types have unique tumor-infiltrating immune cell profiles.Conclusion:IKBIP has the potential to act as a pan-cancer oncogene and is crucial for both carcinogenesis and cancer immunity. Elevated IKBIP expression implies an immunosuppressive environment and may be used as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target.Copyright © 2023 Bi, Wang, Xiao, Zhao, Guo, Xiong, Ji, Li, Li and Qin."

"36994855","An epigenome-wide analysis of sex hormone levels and DNA methylation in male blood samples.","Epigenetics","Endogenous sex hormones and DNA methylation both play important roles in various diseases. However, their interplay is largely unknown. A deeper understanding of their interrelationships could provide new insights into the pathology of disease development. We, therefore, investigated associations between circulating sex hormones, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), and DNA methylation in blood, using samples from 77 men (65 with repeated samples), from the population-based Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study (NSHDS). DNA methylation was measured in buffy coat using the Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip (Illumina). Sex hormone (oestradiol, oestrone, testosterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone, and progesterone) and SHBG concentrations were measured in plasma using a high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) method and an enzyme-linked immunoassay, respectively. Associations between sex hormones, SHBG, and DNA methylation were estimated using both linear regression and mixed-effects models. Additionally, we used the comb-p method to identify differentially methylated regions based on nearbyPvalues. We identified one novel CpG site (cg14319657), at which DNA methylation was associated with dehydroepiandrosterone, surpassing a genome-wide significance level. In addition, more than 40 differentially methylated regions were associated with levels of sex hormones and SHBG and several of these mapped to genes involved in hormone-related diseases. Our findings support a relationship between circulating sex hormones and DNA methylation and suggest that further investigation is warranted, both for validation, further exploration and to gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms and potential consequences for health and disease."
"36993649","The Genetic and Epigenetic Features of Bilateral Wilms Tumor Predisposition: A Report from the Children's Oncology Group AREN18B5-Q Study.","Res Sq","This study comprehensively evaluated the landscape of genetic and epigenetic events that predispose to synchronous bilateral Wilms tumor (BWT). We performed whole exome or whole genome sequencing, total-strand RNA-seq, and DNA methylation analysis using germline and/or tumor samples from 68 patients with BWT from St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and the Children's Oncology Group. We found that 25/61 (41%) of patients evaluated harbored pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline variants, withWT1(14.8%),NYNRIN(6.6%),TRIM28(5%) and the BRCA-related genes (5%)BRCA1,BRCA2, andPALB2being most common. GermlineWT1variants were strongly associated with somatic paternal uniparental disomy encompassing the 11p15.5 and 11p13/WT1loci and subsequent acquired pathogenicCTNNB1variants. Somatic coding variants or genome-wide copy number alterations were almost never shared between paired synchronous BWT, suggesting that the acquisition of independent somatic variants leads to tumor formation in the context of germline or early embryonic, post-zygotic initiating events. In contrast, 11p15.5 status (loss of heterozygosity, loss or retention of imprinting) was shared among paired synchronous BWT in all but one case. The predominant molecular events for BWT predisposition include pathogenic germline variants or post-zygotic epigenetic hypermethylation at the 11p15.5 H19/ICR1 locus (loss of imprinting). This study demonstrates that post-zygotic somatic mosaicism for 11p15.5 hypermethylation/loss of imprinting is the single most common initiating molecular event predisposing to BWT. Evidence of somatic mosaicism for 11p15.5 loss of imprinting was detected in leukocytes of a cohort of BWT patients and long-term survivors, but not in unilateral Wilms tumor patients and long-term survivors or controls, further supporting the hypothesis that post-zygotic 11p15.5 alterations occurred in the mesoderm of patients who go on to develop BWT. Due to the preponderance of BWT patients with demonstrable germline or early embryonic tumor predisposition, BWT exhibits a unique biology when compared to unilateral Wilms tumor and therefore warrants continued refinement of its own treatment-relevant biomarkers which in turn may inform directed treatment strategies in the future."
"36993343","Cell-type specific EWAS identifies genes involved in HIV pathogenesis and oncogenesis among people with HIV infection.","bioRxiv","Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of heterogenous blood cells have identified CpG sites associated with chronic HIV infection, which offer limited knowledge of cell-type specific methylation patterns associated with HIV infection. Applying a computational deconvolution method validated by capture bisulfite DNA methylation sequencing, we conducted a cell type-based EWAS and identified differentially methylated CpG sites specific for chronic HIV infection among five immune cell types in blood: CD4+ T-cells, CD8+ T-cells, B cells, Natural Killer (NK) cells, and monocytes in two independent cohorts (Ntotal=1,134). Differentially methylated CpG sites for HIV-infection were highly concordant between the two cohorts. Cell-type level meta-EWAS revealed distinct patterns of HIV-associated differential CpG methylation, where 67% of CpG sites were unique to individual cell types (false discovery rate, FDR <0.05). CD4+ T-cells had the largest number of HIV-associated CpG sites (N=1,472) compared to any other cell type. Genes harboring statistically significant CpG sites are involved in immunity and HIV pathogenesis (e.g.CX3CR1in CD4+ T-cells,CCR7in B cells,IL12Rin NK cells,LCKin monocytes). More importantly, HIV-associated CpG sites were overrepresented for hallmark genes involved in cancer pathology (FDR<0.05) (e.g.BCL family, PRDM16, PDCD1LGD, ESR1, DNMT3A, NOTCH2). HIV-associated CpG sites were enriched among genes involved in HIV pathogenesis and oncogenesis such as Kras-signaling, interferon-α and -γ, TNF-α, inflammatory, and apoptotic pathways. Our findings are novel, uncovering cell-type specific modifications in the host epigenome for people with HIV that contribute to the growing body of evidence regarding pathogen-induced epigenetic oncogenicity, specifically on HIV and its comorbidity with cancers."

Here, we performed a genome-wide association study of cortical tau quantified by positron emission tomography in 3,136 participants from 12 independent studies. TheCYP1B1-RMDN2locus was associated with tau deposition. The most significant signal was at rs2113389, which explained 4.3% of the variation in cortical tau, whileAPOE4rs429358 accounted for 3.6%. rs2113389 was associated with higher tau and faster cognitive decline. Additive effects, but no interactions, were observed between rs2113389 and diagnosis,APOE4, and Aβ positivity.CYP1B1expression was upregulated in AD. rs2113389 was associated with higherCYP1B1expression and methylation levels. Mouse model studies provided additional functional evidence for a relationship betweenCYP1B1and tau deposition but not Aβ.

"36991516","DNA methylation age in paired tumor and adjacent normal breast tissue in Chinese women with breast cancer.","Clin Epigenetics","Few studies have examined epigenetic age acceleration (AA), the difference between DNA methylation (DNAm) predicted age and chronological age, in relation to somatic genomic features in paired cancer and normal tissue, with less work done in non-European populations. In this study, we aimed to examine DNAm age and its associations with breast cancer risk factors, subtypes, somatic genomic profiles including mutation and copy number alterations and other aging markers in breast tissue of Chinese breast cancer (BC) patients from Hong Kong.We performed genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of 196 tumor and 188 paired adjacent normal tissue collected from Chinese BC patients in Hong Kong (HKBC) using Illumina MethylationEPIC array. The DNAm age was calculated using Horvath's pan-tissue clock model. Somatic genomic features were based on data from RNA sequencing (RNASeq), whole-exome sequencing (WES), and whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Pearson's correlation (r), Kruskal-Wallis test, and regression models were used to estimate associations of DNAm AA with somatic features and breast cancer risk factors.DNAm age showed a stronger correlation with chronological age in normal (Pearson r = 0.78, P < 2.2e-16) than in tumor tissue (Pearson r = 0.31, P = 7.8e-06). Although overall DNAm age or AA did not vary significantly by tissue within the same individual, luminal A tumors exhibited increased DNAm AA (P = 0.004) while HER2-enriched/basal-like tumors exhibited markedly lower DNAm AA (P = < .0001) compared with paired normal tissue. Consistent with the subtype association, tumor DNAm AA was positively correlated with ESR1 (Pearson r = 0.39, P = 6.3e-06) and PGR (Pearson r = 0.36, P = 2.4e-05) gene expression. In line with this, we found that increasing DNAm AA was associated with higher body mass index (P = 0.039) and earlier age at menarche (P = 0.035), factors that are related to cumulative exposure to estrogen. In contrast, variables indicating extensive genomic instability, such as TP53 somatic mutations, high tumor mutation/copy number alteration burden, and homologous repair deficiency were associated with lower DNAm AA.Our findings provide additional insights into the complexity of breast tissue aging that is associated with the interaction of hormonal, genomic, and epigenetic mechanisms in an East Asian population.© 2023.

"36991182","Identification and functional characterization of three cytochrome P450 genes for the abietane diterpenoid biosynthesis in Isodon lophanthoides.","Planta","We identify two ferruginol synthases and a 11-hydroxyferruginol synthase from a traditional Chinese medicinal herb Isodon lophanthoides and propose their involvement in two independent abietane diterpenoids biosynthetic pathways. Isodon lophanthoides is a traditional Chinese medicinal herb rich in highly oxidized abietane-type diterpenoids. These compounds exhibit a wide range of pharmaceutical activities, yet the biosynthesis is barely known. Here, we describe the screening and functional characterization of P450s that oxidize the abietane skeleton abietatriene. We mainly focused on CYP76 family and identified 12 CYP76AHs by mining the RNA-seq data of I. lophanthoides. Among the 12 CYP76AHs, 6 exhibited similar transcriptional expression features as upstream diterpene synthases, including root or leaf-preferential expression pattern and highly MeJA inducibility. These six P450s were considered as first-tier candidates and functionally characterized in yeast and plant cells. In yeast assays showed that both CYP76AH42 and CYP76AH43 were ferruginol synthases hydroxylating the C12 position of abietatriene, whereas CYP76AH46 was characterized as a 11-hydroxyferruginol synthase which catalyzes two successive oxidations at C12 and C11 of abietatriene. Heterologous expression of three CYP76AHs in Nicotiana benthamiana resulted in the formation of ferruginol. qPCR analysis showed CYP76AH42 and CYP76AH43 were mainly expressed in the root, which was consistent with the distribution of ferruginol in the root periderms. CYP76AH46 was primarily expressed in the leaves where barely ferruginol or 11-hydroxyferruginol was detected. In addition to distinct organ-specific expression pattern, three CYP76AHs exhibited different genomic structures (w or w/o introns), low protein sequence identities (51-63%) and were placed in separate subclades in the phylogenetic tree. These results suggest that the identified CYP76AHs may be involved in at least two independent abietane biosynthetic pathways in the aerial and underground parts of I. lophanthoides.© 2023.

"36990534","Multi-CpG linear regression models to accurately predict paclitaxel and docetaxel activity in cancer cell lines.","Adv Cancer Res","The microtubule-targeting paclitaxel (PTX) and docetaxel (DTX) are widely used chemotherapeutic agents. However, the dysregulation of apoptotic processes, microtubule-binding proteins, and multi-drug resistance efflux and influx proteins can alter the efficacy of taxane drugs. In this review, we have created multi-CpG linear regression models to predict the activities of PTX and DTX drugs through the integration of publicly available pharmacological and genome-wide molecular profiling datasets generated using hundreds of cancer cell lines of diverse tissue of origin. Our findings indicate that linear regression models based on CpG methylation levels can predict PTX and DTX activities (log-fold change in viability relative to DMSO) with high precision. For example, a 287-CpG model predicts PTX activity at R2of 0.985 among 399 cell lines. Just as precise (R2=0.996) is a 342-CpG model for predicting DTX activity in 390 cell lines. However, our predictive models, which employ a combination of mRNA expression and mutation as input variables, are less accurate compared to the CpG-based models. While a 290 mRNA/mutation model was able to predict PTX activity with R2of 0.830 (for 546 cell lines), a 236 mRNA/mutation model could calculate DTX activity at R2of 0.751 (for 531 cell lines). The CpG-based models restricted to lung cancer cell lines were also highly predictive (R2≥0.980) for PTX (74 CpGs, 88 cell lines) and DTX (58 CpGs, 83 cell lines). The underlying molecular biology behind taxane activity/resistance is evident in these models. Indeed, many of the genes represented in PTX or DTX CpG-based models have functionalities related to apoptosis (e.g., ACIN1, TP73, TNFRSF10B, DNASE1, DFFB, CREB1, BNIP3), and mitosis/microtubules (e.g., MAD1L1, ANAPC2, EML4, PARP3, CCT6A, JAKMIP1). Also represented are genes involved in epigenetic regulation (HDAC4, DNMT3B, and histone demethylases KDM4B, KDM4C, KDM2B, and KDM7A), and those that have never been previously linked to taxane activity (DIP2C, PTPRN2, TTC23, SHANK2). In summary, it is possible to accurately predict taxane activity in cell lines based entirely on methylation at multiple CpG sites.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"36989612","Flavored E-cigarette product aerosols induce transformation of human bronchial epithelial cells.","Lung Cancer","E-cigarettes are the most commonly used nicotine containing products among youth. In vitro studies support the potential for e-cigarettes to cause cellular stress in vivo; however, there have been no studies to address whether exposure to e-liquid aerosols can induce cell transformation, a process strongly associated with pre-malignancy. We examined whether weekly exposure of human bronchial epithelial cell (HBEC) lines to e-cigarette aerosols would induce transformation and concomitant changes in gene expression and promoter hypermethylation.An aerosol delivery system exposed three HBEC lines to unflavored e-liquid with 1.2% nicotine, 3 flavored products with nicotine, or the Kentucky reference cigarette once a week for 12 weeks. Colony formation in soft agar, RNA-sequencing, and the EPIC Beadchip were used to evaluate transformation, genome-wide expression and methylation changes.Jamestown e-liquid aerosol induced transformation of HBEC2 and HBEC26, while unflavored and Blue Pucker transformed HBEC26. Cigarette smoke aerosol transformed HBEC4 and HBEC26 at efficiencies up to 3-fold greater than e-liquids. Transformed clones exhibited extensive reprogramming of the transcriptome with common and distinct gene expression changes observed between the cigarette and e-liquids. Transformation by e-liquids induced alterations in canonical pathways implicated in lung cancer that included axonal guidance and NRF2. Gene methylation, while prominent in cigarette-induced transformed clones, also affected hundreds of genes in HBEC2 transformed by Jamestown. Many genes with altered expression or epigenetic-mediated silencing were also affected in lung tumors from smokers.These studies show that exposure to e-liquid aerosols can induce a pre-malignant phenotype in lung epithelial cells. While the Food and Drug Administration banned the sale of flavored cartridge-based electric cigarettes, consumers switched to using flavored products through other devices. Our findings clearly support expanding studies to evaluate transformation potency for the major categories of e-liquid flavors to better inform risk from these complex mixtures.Copyright © 2023.

However, the pathological importance remains unclear. Here, we show that the homing endonuclease I-PpoI-induced DNA double-strand breaks in kidney glomerular podocytes cause proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis with DNA methylation changes in blood cells as well as in podocytes. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis reveals an increase in cytotoxic CD8+T cells with the activating/costimulatory receptor NKG2D in the kidneys, which exhibit a memory precursor effector cell phenotype, and the CD44highmemory CD8+T cells are also increased in the peripheral circulation. NKG2D blockade attenuates the renal phenotype caused by podocyte DNA damage. Blood methylome shows increased DNA methylation in binding sites for STAT1, a transcription factor contributing to CD8+T cell homeostasis. Collectively, podocyte DNA damage alters the blood methylome, leading to changes in CD8+T cells, which contribute to sustained renal injury in chronic kidney disease.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

However, there is scarce information on the expression profiles and roles of2ODD-Cgenes inCamellia sinensis. We identified 153Cs2ODD-Cgenes fromC. sinensis, and they were distributed unevenly on 15 chromosomes. According to the phylogenetic tree topology, these genes were divided into 21 groups distinguished by conserved motifs and an intron/exon structure. Gene-duplication analyses revealed that 75Cs2ODD-Cgenes were expanded and retained after WGD/segmental and tandem duplications. The expression profiles ofCs2ODD-Cgenes were explored under methyl jasmonate (MeJA), polyethylene glycol (PEG), and salt (NaCl) stress treatments. The expression analysis showed that 14, 13, and 49Cs2ODD-Cgenes displayed the same expression pattern under MeJA and PEG treatments, MeJA and NaCl treatments, and PEG and NaCl treatments, respectively. A further analysis showed that two genes,Cs2ODD-C36andCs2ODD-C21, were significantly upregulated and downregulated after MeJA, PEG, and NaCl treatments, indicating that these two genes played positive and negative roles in enhancing the multi-stress tolerance. These results provide candidate genes for the use of genetic engineering technology to modify plants by enhancing multi-stress tolerance to promote phytoremediation efficiency."

Disruption of the balance is often associated with various disorders and diseases. Both HIV infection and cocaine use are known to change the gut microbiota and the epithelial barrier integrity, which contribute to inflammation and immune activation. Our recent study shows that Tat expression and cocaine exposure result in changes of genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression and lead to worsen the learning and memory impairments. In the current study, we extended the study to determine effects of Tat and cocaine on the gut microbiota composition. We found that both Tat expression and cocaine exposure increased Alteromonadaceae in 6-month-old female/male mice. In addition, we found that Tat, cocaine, or both increased Alteromonadaceae, Bacteroidaceae, Cyanobiaceae, Erysipelotrichaceae, and Muribaculaceae but decreased Clostridiales_vadinBB60_group, Desulfovibrionaceae, Helicobacteraceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Ruminococcaceae in 12-month-old female mice. Lastly, we analyzed changes of metabolic pathways and found that Tat decreased energy metabolism and nucleotide metabolism, and increased lipid metabolism and metabolism of other amino acids while cocaine increased lipid metabolism in 12-month-old female mice. These results demonstrated that Tat expression and cocaine exposure resulted in significant changes of the gut microbiota in an age- and sex-dependent manner and provide additional evidence to support the bidirectional gut-brain axis hypothesis."

Genome-wide analysis of the DNA methylation profile has identified 220 differentially methylated loci associated with human IVD degeneration. Among these, two cell-cycle-associated genes, growth arrest and DNA damage 45 gamma (GADD45G) and cytoplasmic activation/proliferation-associated protein-1 (CAPRIN1), were focused on. The expression of GADD45G and CAPRIN1 in human IVDs remains unknown. We aimed to examine the expression of GADD45G and CAPRIN1 in human nucleus pulposus (NP) cells and evaluate those in human NP tissues in the early and advanced stages of degeneration according to Pfirrmann magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histological classifications. Human NP cells were cultured as monolayers after isolation from NP tissues by sequential enzyme digestion. Total RNA was isolated, and the mRNA expression of GADD45G and CAPRIN1 was quantified using real-time polymerase chain reaction. To examine the effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines on mRNA expression, human NP cells were cultured in the presence of IL-1β. Protein expression was evaluated using Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. GADD45G and CAPRIN1 expression was identified in human NP cells at both mRNA and protein levels. The percentage of cells immunopositive for GADD45G and CAPRIN1 significantly increased according to the Pfirrmann grade. A significant correlation between the histological degeneration score and the percentage of GADD45G-immunopositive cells was identified, but not with that of CAPRIN1-immunopositive cells. The expression of cell-cycle-associated proteins (GADD45G and CAPRIN1) was enhanced in human NP cells at an advanced stage of degeneration, suggesting that it may be regulated during the progression of IVD degeneration to maintain the integrity of human NP tissues by controlling cell proliferation and apoptosis under epigenetic alteration."
"36981040","Genome-Wide Identification and Expression Analysis of TPS Gene Family in Liriodendron chinense.","Genes (Basel)","Terpenoids play a key role in plant growth and development, supporting resistance regulation and terpene synthase (TPS), which is the last link in the synthesis process of terpenoids.Liriodendron chinense,commonly called the Chinese tulip tree, is a rare and endangered tree species of the family Magnoliaceae. However, the genome-wide identification of theTPSgene family and its transcriptional responses to development and abiotic stress are still unclear. In the present study, we identified a total of 58TPSgenes throughout theL. chinensegenome. A phylogenetic tree analysis showed that they were clustered into five subfamilies and unevenly distributed across six chromosomes. A cis-acting element analysis indicated thatLcTPSswere assumed to be highly responsive to stress hormones, such as methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and abscisic acid (ABA). Consistent with this, transcriptome data showed that mostLcTPSgenes responded to abiotic stress, such as cold, drought, and hot stress, at the transcriptional level. Further analysis showed thatLcTPSgenes were expressed in a tissue-dependent manner, especially in buds, leaves, and bark. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis confirmed thatLcTPSexpression was significantly higher in mature leaves compared to young leaves. These results provide a reference for understanding the function and role of theTPSfamily, laying a foundation for further study of the regulation ofTPSin terpenoid biosynthesis inL. chinense."
"36980932","Exome-Wide Association Study of Competitive Performance in Elite Athletes.","Genes (Basel)","The aim of the study was to identify genetic variants associated with personal best scores in Turkish track and field athletes and to compare allelic frequencies between sprint/power and endurance athletes and controls using a whole-exome sequencing (WES) approach, followed by replication studies in independent cohorts. The discovery phase involved 60 elite Turkish athletes (31 sprint/power and 29 endurance) and 20 ethnically matched controls. The replication phase involved 1132 individuals (115 elite Russian sprinters, 373 elite Russian endurance athletes (of which 75 athletes were with VO2maxmeasurements), 209 controls, 148 Russian and 287 Finnish individuals with muscle fiber composition and cross-sectional area (CSA) data). None of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) reached an exome-wide significance level (p< 2.3 × 10-7) in genotype-phenotype and case-control studies of Turkish athletes. However, of the 53 nominally (p< 0.05) associated SNPs, four functional variants were replicated. TheSIRT1rs41299232 G allele was significantly over-represented in Turkish (p= 0.047) and Russian (p= 0.018) endurance athletes compared to sprint/power athletes and was associated with increased VO2max(p= 0.037) and a greater proportion of slow-twitch muscle fibers (p= 0.035). TheNUP210rs2280084 A allele was significantly over-represented in Turkish (p= 0.044) and Russian (p= 0.012) endurance athletes compared to sprint/power athletes. TheTRPM2rs1785440 G allele was significantly over-represented in Turkish endurance athletes compared to sprint/power athletes (p= 0.034) and was associated with increased VO2max(p= 0.008). TheAGRNrs4074992 C allele was significantly over-represented in Turkish sprint/power athletes compared to endurance athletes (p= 0.037) and was associated with a greater CSA of fast-twitch muscle fibers (p= 0.024). In conclusion, we present the first WES study of athletes showing that this approach can be used to identify novel genetic markers associated with exercise- and sport-related phenotypes."
"36979655","Epigenome-Wide Association Studies of the Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide and Bronchodilator Drug Response in Moderate-to-Severe Pediatric Asthma.","Biomedicines","Asthma is the most prevalent pediatric chronic disease. Bronchodilator drug response (BDR) and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) are clinical biomarkers of asthma. Although DNA methylation (DNAm) contributes to asthma pathogenesis, the influence of DNAm on BDR and FeNO is scarcely investigated. This study aims to identify DNAm markers in whole blood associated either with BDR or FeNO in pediatric asthma. We analyzed 121 samples from children with moderate-to-severe asthma. The association of genome-wide DNAm with BDR and FeNO has been assessed using regression models, adjusting for age, sex, ancestry, and tissue heterogeneity. Cross-tissue validation was assessed in 50 nasal samples. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and enrichment in traits and biological pathways were assessed. A false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.1 and a genome-wide significance threshold ofp< 9 × 10-8were used to control for false-positive results. The CpG cg12835256 (PLA2G12A) was genome-wide associated with FeNO in blood samples (coefficient= -0.015,p= 2.53 × 10-9) and nominally associated in nasal samples (coefficient = -0.015,p= 0.045). Additionally, three CpGs were suggestively associated with BDR (FDR < 0.1). We identified 12 and four DMRs associated with FeNO and BDR (FDR < 0.05), respectively. An enrichment in allergic and inflammatory processes, smoking, and aging was observed. We reported novel associations of DNAm markers associated with BDR and FeNO enriched in asthma-related processes."

An algorithm is also established to determine how the pathophysiological condition might influence the human biological cardiac age.Blood samples and cardiac auricles were collected from patients who underwent cardiac procedures: 94 AVR and 289 CABG. The CpGs from three independent blood-derived biological clocks were selected to design a new blood- and the first cardiac-specific clocks. Specifically, 31 CpGs from six age-related genes, ELOVL2, EDARADD, ITGA2B, ASPA, PDE4C, and FHL2, were used to construct the tissue-tailored clocks. The best-fitting variables were combined to define new cardiac- and blood-tailored clocks validated through neural network analysis and elastic regression. In addition, telomere length (TL) was measured by qPCR. These new methods revealed a similarity between chronological and biological age in the blood and heart; the average TL was significantly higher in the heart than in the blood. In addition, the cardiac clock discriminated well between AVR and CABG and was sensitive to cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity and smoking. Moreover, the cardiac-specific clock identified an AVR patient's subgroup whose accelerated bioage correlated with the altered ventricular parameters, including left ventricular diastolic and systolic volume.This study reports on applying a method to evaluate the cardiac biological age revealing epigenetic features that separate subgroups of AVR and CABG.© 2023.

"36991458","DNA methylation and cardiovascular disease in humans: a systematic review and database of known CpG methylation sites.","Clin Epigenetics","Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide and considered one of the most environmentally driven diseases. The role of DNA methylation in response to the individual exposure for the development and progression of CVD is still poorly understood and a synthesis of the evidence is lacking.A systematic review of articles examining measurements of DNA cytosine methylation in CVD was conducted in accordance with PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) guidelines. The search yielded 5,563 articles from PubMed and CENTRAL databases. From 99 studies with a total of 87,827 individuals eligible for analysis, a database was created combining all CpG-, gene- and study-related information. It contains 74,580 unique CpG sites, of which 1452 CpG sites were mentioned in ≥ 2, and 441 CpG sites in ≥ 3 publications. Two sites were referenced in ≥ 6 publications: cg01656216 (near ZNF438) related to vascular disease and epigenetic age, and cg03636183 (near F2RL3) related to coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, smoking and air pollution. Of 19,127 mapped genes, 5,807 were reported in ≥ 2 studies. Most frequently reported were TEAD1 (TEA Domain Transcription Factor 1) and PTPRN2 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Receptor Type N2) in association with outcomes ranging from vascular to cardiac disease. Gene set enrichment analysis of 4,532 overlapping genes revealed enrichment for Gene Ontology molecular function ""DNA-binding transcription activator activity"" (q = 1.65 × 10-11) and biological processes ""skeletal system development"" (q = 1.89 × 10-23). Gene enrichment demonstrated that general CVD-related terms are shared, while ""heart"" and ""vasculature"" specific genes have more disease-specific terms as PR interval for ""heart"" or platelet distribution width for ""vasculature."" STRING analysis revealed significant protein-protein interactions between the products of the differentially methylated genes (p = 0.003) suggesting that dysregulation of the protein interaction network could contribute to CVD. Overlaps with curated gene sets from the Molecular Signatures Database showed enrichment of genes in hemostasis (p = 2.9 × 10-6) and atherosclerosis (p = 4.9 × 10-4).This review highlights the current state of knowledge on significant relationship between DNA methylation and CVD in humans. An open-access database has been compiled of reported CpG methylation sites, genes and pathways that may play an important role in this relationship.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36979330","Turning Back the Clock: A Retrospective Single-Blind Study on Brain Age Change in Response to Nutraceuticals Supplementation vs. Lifestyle Modifications.","Brain Sci","There is a growing consensus that chronological age (CA) is not an accurate indicator of the aging process and that biological age (BA) instead is a better measure of an individual's risk of age-related outcomes and a more accurate predictor of mortality than actual CA. In this context, BA measures the ""true"" age, which is an integrated result of an individual's level of damage accumulation across all levels of biological organization, along with preserved resources. The BA is plastic and depends upon epigenetics. Brain state is an important factor contributing to health- and lifespan.Quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG)-derived brain BA (BBA) is a suitable and promising measure of brain aging. In the present study, we aimed to show that BBA can be decelerated or even reversed in humans (N = 89) by using customized programs of nutraceutical compounds or lifestyle changes (mean duration = 13 months).We observed that BBA was younger than CA in both groups at the end of the intervention. Furthermore, the BBA of the participants in the nutraceuticals group was 2.83 years younger at the endpoint of the intervention compared with their BBA score at the beginning of the intervention, while the BBA of the participants in the lifestyle group was only 0.02 years younger at the end of the intervention. These results were accompanied by improvements in mental-physical health comorbidities in both groups. The pre-intervention BBA score and the sex of the participants were considered confounding factors and analyzed separately.Overall, the obtained results support the feasibility of the goal of this study and also provide the first robust evidence that halting and reversal of brain aging are possible in humans within a reasonable (practical) timeframe of approximately one year."
"36945654","Mother's childhood adversity is associated with accelerated epigenetic aging in pregnancy and in male newborns.","bioRxiv","Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are correlated with accelerated epigenetic aging, but it is not clear whether altered epigenetic aging from childhood adversities persists into adulthood and can be transmitted to the next generation. Thus, we tested whether mothers' childhood adversity is associated with accelerated epigenetic aging during pregnancy and in their newborn offspring.Data were from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) sub-study, Accessible Resource for Integrated Epigenomic Studies (ARIES). Women provided retrospective self-reports during pregnancy of ACE exposure. DNA methylation was measured in mothers during pregnancy and cord blood at birth. Estimates of epigenetic age acceleration were calculated using Principal Components of Horvath, Hannum skin & blood, GrimAge, PhenoAge, and DunedinPACE epigenetic clocks for mothers; and the Knight and Bohlin cord blood clocks for newborns. Associations between a cumulative maternal ACE score and epigenetic age acceleration were estimated using linear regression models, adjusting for maternal age at pregnancy, smoking during pregnancy, education, and pre-pregnancy BMI. Models for offspring were stratified by sex and additionally adjusted for gestation age.Mothers' total ACE score was positively associated with accelerated maternal PhenoAge and GrimAge. In newborn offspring, mothers' total ACE score was positively associated with accelerated epigenetic aging in males using the Bohlin clock, but not in females using either epigenetic clock. We found male offsprings' epigenetic age was accelerated in those born to mothers exposed to neglect using the Knight clock; and parental substance abuse using the Bohlin clock.Our results show that mothers' ACE exposure is associated with DNAm age acceleration in male offspring, supporting the notion that DNAm age could be a marker of intergenerational biological embedding of mothers' childhood adversity. This is consistent with findings on vulnerability of male fetuses to environmental insults."
"37012247","Candidate biomarkers from the integration of methylation and gene expression in discordant autistic sibling pairs.","Transl Psychiatry","While the genetics of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has been intensively studied, resulting in the identification of over 100 putative risk genes, the epigenetics of ASD has received less attention, and results have been inconsistent across studies. We aimed to investigate the contribution of DNA methylation (DNAm) to the risk of ASD and identify candidate biomarkers arising from the interaction of epigenetic mechanisms with genotype, gene expression, and cellular proportions. We performed DNAm differential analysis using whole blood samples from 75 discordant sibling pairs of the Italian Autism Network collection and estimated their cellular composition. We studied the correlation between DNAm and gene expression accounting for the potential effects of different genotypes on DNAm. We showed that the proportion of NK cells was significantly reduced in ASD siblings suggesting an imbalance in their immune system. We identified differentially methylated regions (DMRs) involved in neurogenesis and synaptic organization. Among candidate loci for ASD, we detected a DMR mapping to CLEC11A (neighboring SHANK1) where DNAm and gene expression were significantly and negatively correlated, independently from genotype effects. As reported in previous studies, we confirmed the involvement of immune functions in the pathophysiology of ASD. Notwithstanding the complexity of the disorder, suitable biomarkers such as CLEC11A and its neighbor SHANK1 can be discovered using integrative analyses even with peripheral tissues.© 2023.

Each ADHD patient presents with individual cognitive and motivational peculiarities. Furthermore, choice of appropriate therapy is still up to clinicians, who express somewhat qualitative advice on whether a child is being successfully cured or not: it would be more appropriate to use an objective biomarker to indicate whether a treatment led to benefits or not. The aim of our work is to search for such clinical biomarkers. We recruited 60 ADHD kids; psychopathological scales were administered at recruitment and after six weeks of therapy. Out of such a cohort of ADHD children, we rigorously extracted two specific subgroups; regardless of the initial severity of their disease, we compared those who obtained the largest improvement (ΔCGAS > 5) vs. those who were still characterized by a severe condition (CGAS < 40). After such a therapy, methylation levels of DNA extracted from buccal swabs were measured in the 5'-UTR of the DAT1 gene. CpGs 3 and 5 displayed, in relation to the other CpGs, a particular symmetrical pattern; for ""improving"" ADHD children, they were methylated together with CpG 2 and CpG 6; instead, for ""severe"" ADHD children, they accompanied a methylated CpG 1. These specific patterns of methylation could be used as objective molecular biomarkers of successful cures, establishing if a certain therapy is akin to a given patient (personalized medicine). Present data support the use of post-therapy molecular data obtained with non-invasive techniques."
"36979424","Maternal Immune Activation Induces Adolescent Cognitive Deficits Preceded by Developmental Perturbations in Cortical Reelin Signalling.","Biomolecules","Exposure to maternal immune activation (MIA) in utero significantly elevates the risk of developing schizophrenia and other neurodevelopmental disorders. To understand the biological mechanisms underlying the link between MIA and increased risk, preclinical animal models have focussed on specific signalling pathways in the brain that mediate symptoms associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as cognitive dysfunction. Reelin signalling in multiple brain regions is involved in neuronal migration, synaptic plasticity and long-term potentiation, and has been implicated in cognitive deficits. However, how regulation of Reelin expression is affected by MIA across cortical development and associated cognitive functions remains largely unclear. Using a MIA rat model, here we demonstrate cognitive deficits in adolescent object-location memory in MIA offspring and reductions inRelnexpression prenatally and in the adult prefrontal cortex. Further, developmental disturbances in gene/protein expression and DNA methylation of downstream signalling components occurred subsequent to MIA-induced Reelin dysregulation and prior to cognitive deficits. We propose that MIA-induced dysregulation of Reelin signalling contributes to the emergence of prefrontal cortex-mediated cognitive deficits through altered NMDA receptor function, resulting in inefficient long-term potentiation. Our data suggest a developmental window during which attenuation of Reelin signalling may provide a possible therapeutic target."
"36974068","Inferring the heritability of bacterial traits in the era of machine learning.","Bioinform Adv","Quantification of heritability is a fundamental desideratum in genetics, which allows an assessment of the contribution of additive genetic variation to the variability of a trait of interest. The traditional computational approaches for assessing the heritability of a trait have been developed in the field of quantitative genetics. However, the rise of modern population genomics with large sample sizes has led to the development of several new machine learning-based approaches to inferring heritability. In this article, we systematically summarize recent advances in machine learning which can be used to infer heritability. We focus on an application of these methods to bacterial genomes, where heritability plays a key role in understanding phenotypes such as antibiotic resistance and virulence, which are particularly important due to the rising frequency of antimicrobial resistance. By designing a heritability model incorporating realistic patterns of genome-wide linkage disequilibrium for a frequently recombining bacterial pathogen, we test the performance of a wide spectrum of different inference methods, including also GCTA. In addition to the synthetic data benchmark, we present a comparison of the methods for antibiotic resistance traits for multiple bacterial pathogens. Insights from the benchmarking and real data analyses indicate a highly variable performance of the different methods and suggest that heritability inference would likely benefit from tailoring of the methods to the specific genetic architecture of the target organism.The R codes and data used in the numerical experiments are available at: https://github.com/tienmt/her_MLs.© The Author(s) 2023.

Chronic age-related conditions such as neurodegenerative diseases are leading causes of death worldwide, and they are becoming a pressing problem for our society. To address this global challenge, there is a need for novel, safe, and effective rejuvenation therapies aimed at reversing age-related phenotypes and improving human health. With gene expression being a key determinant of cell identity and function, and in light of recent studies reporting rejuvenation effects through genetic perturbations, we propose an age reversal strategy focused on reprogramming the cell transcriptome to a youthful state. To this end, we suggest using transcriptomic data from primary human cells to predict rejuvenation targets and develop high-throughput aging assays, which can be used in large perturbation screens. We propose neural cells as particularly relevant targets for rejuvenation due to substantial impact of neurodegeneration on human frailty. Of all cell types in the brain, we argue that glutamatergic neurons, neuronal stem cells, and oligodendrocytes represent the most impactful and tractable targets. Lastly, we provide experimental designs for anti-aging reprogramming screens that will likely enable the development of neuronal age reversal therapies, which hold promise for dramatically improving human health.© 2023.

"36982782","Molecular Markers of Blood Cell Populations Can Help Estimate Aging of the Immune System.","Int J Mol Sci","Aging of the immune system involves functional changes in individual cell populations, in hematopoietic tissues and at the systemic level. They are mediated by factors produced by circulating cells, niche cells, and at the systemic level. Age-related alterations in the microenvironment of the bone marrow and thymus cause a decrease in the production of naive immune cells and functional immunodeficiencies. Another result of aging and reduced tissue immune surveillance is the accumulation of senescent cells. Some viral infections deplete adaptive immune cells, increasing the risk of autoimmune and immunodeficiency conditions, leading to a general degradation in the specificity and effectiveness of the immune system in old age. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the state-of-the-art application of mass spectrometry, multichannel flow cytometry, and single-cell genetic analysis have provided vast data on the mechanisms of aging of the immune system. These data require systematic analysis and functional verification. In addition, the prediction of age-related complications is a priority task of modern medicine in the context of the increase in the aged population and the risk of premature death during epidemics. In this review, based on the latest data, we discuss the mechanisms of immune aging and highlight some cellular markers as indicators of age-related immune disbalance that increase the risk of senile diseases and infectious complications."
"36981025","Moderation of Structural DNA Properties by Coupled Dinucleotide Contents in Eukaryotes.","Genes (Basel)","Dinucleotides are known as determinants for various structural and physiochemical properties of DNA and for binding affinities of proteins to DNA. These properties (e.g., stiffness) and bound proteins (e.g., transcription factors) are known to influence important biological functions, such as transcription regulation and 3D chromatin organization. Accordingly, the question arises of how the considerable variations in dinucleotide contents of eukaryotic chromosomes could still provide consistent DNA properties resulting in similar functions and 3D conformations. In this work, we investigate the hypothesis that coupled dinucleotide contents influence DNA properties in opposite directions to moderate each other's influences. Analyzing all 2478 chromosomes of 155 eukaryotic species, considering bias from coding sequences and enhancers, we found sets of correlated and anti-correlated dinucleotide contents. Using computational models, we estimated changes of DNA properties resulting from this coupling. We found that especially pure A/T dinucleotides (AA, TT, AT, TA), known to influence histone positioning and AC/GT contents, are relevant moderators and that, e.g., the Roll property, which is known to influence histone affinity of DNA, is preferably moderated. We conclude that dinucleotide contents might indirectly influence transcription and chromatin 3D conformation, via regulation of histone occupancy and/or other mechanisms."
"36980849","Epigenetic Regulation of β-Globin Genes and the Potential to Treat Hemoglobinopathies through Epigenome Editing.","Genes (Basel)","Beta-like globin gene expression is developmentally regulated during life by transcription factors, chromatin looping and epigenome modifications of the β-globin locus. Epigenome modifications, such as histone methylation/demethylation and acetylation/deacetylation and DNA methylation, are associated with up- or down-regulation of gene expression. The understanding of these mechanisms and their outcome in gene expression has paved the way to the development of new therapeutic strategies for treating various diseases, such as β-hemoglobinopathies. Histone deacetylase and DNA methyl-transferase inhibitors are currently being tested in clinical trials for hemoglobinopathies patients. However, these approaches are often uncertain, non-specific and their global effect poses serious safety concerns. Epigenome editing is a recently developed and promising tool that consists of a DNA recognition domain (zinc finger, transcription activator-like effector or dead clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats Cas9) fused to the catalytic domain of a chromatin-modifying enzyme. It offers a more specific targeting of disease-related genes (e.g., the ability to reactivate the fetal γ-globin genes and improve the hemoglobinopathy phenotype) and it facilitates the development of scarless gene therapy approaches. Here, we summarize the mechanisms of epigenome regulation of the β-globin locus, and we discuss the application of epigenome editing for the treatment of hemoglobinopathies."
"36980874","The Molecular and Cellular Basis of Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome and Potential Treatments.","Genes (Basel)","Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare, autosomal-dominant, and fatal premature aging syndrome. HGPS is most often derived from a de novo point mutation in theLMNAgene, which results in an alternative splicing defect and the generation of the mutant protein, progerin. Progerin behaves in a dominant-negative fashion, leading to a variety of cellular and molecular changes, including nuclear abnormalities, defective DNA damage response (DDR) and DNA repair, and accelerated telomere attrition. Intriguingly, many of the manifestations of the HGPS cells are shared with normal aging cells. However, at a clinical level, HGPS does not fully match normal aging because of the accelerated nature of the phenotypes and its primary effects on connective tissues. Furthermore, the epigenetic changes in HGPS patients are of great interest and may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of HGPS. Finally, various treatments for the HGPS patients have been developed in recent years with important effects at a cellular level, which translate to symptomatic improvement and increased lifespan."

"36993280","Accurate estimation of rare cell type fractions from tissue omics data via hierarchical deconvolution.","bioRxiv","Bulk transcriptomics in tissue samples reflects the average expression levels across different cell types and is highly influenced by cellular fractions. As such, it is critical to estimate cellular fractions to both deconfound differential expression analyses and infer cell type-specific differential expression. Since experimentally counting cells is infeasible in most tissues and studies,in silicocellular deconvolution methods have been developed as an alternative. However, existing methods are designed for tissues consisting of clearly distinguishable cell types and have difficulties estimating highly correlated or rare cell types. To address this challenge, we propose Hierarchical Deconvolution (HiDecon) that uses single-cell RNA sequencing references and a hierarchical cell type tree, which models the similarities among cell types and cell differentiation relationships, to estimate cellular fractions in bulk data. By coordinating cell fractions across layers of the hierarchical tree, cellular fraction information is passed up and down the tree, which helps correct estimation biases by pooling information across related cell types. The flexible hierarchical tree structure also enables estimating rare cell fractions by splitting the tree to higher resolutions. Through simulations and real data applications with the ground truth of measured cellular fractions, we demonstrate that HiDecon significantly outperforms existing methods and accurately estimates cellular fractions."
"37012456","Genetic effects on the timing of parturition and links to fetal birth weight.","Nat Genet","The timing of parturition is crucial for neonatal survival and infant health. Yet, its genetic basis remains largely unresolved. We present a maternal genome-wide meta-analysis of gestational duration (n = 195,555), identifying 22 associated loci (24 independent variants) and an enrichment in genes differentially expressed during labor. A meta-analysis of preterm delivery (18,797 cases, 260,246 controls) revealed six associated loci and large genetic similarities with gestational duration. Analysis of the parental transmitted and nontransmitted alleles (n = 136,833) shows that 15 of the gestational duration genetic variants act through the maternal genome, whereas 7 act both through the maternal and fetal genomes and 2 act only via the fetal genome. Finally, the maternal effects on gestational duration show signs of antagonistic pleiotropy with the fetal effects on birth weight: maternal alleles that increase gestational duration have negative fetal effects on birth weight. The present study provides insights into the genetic effects on the timing of parturition and the complex maternal-fetal relationship between gestational duration and birth weight.© 2023.

Yet, the molecular identities of the cell types, and their positions within individual anatomical structures, remain incompletely known. To construct a comprehensive atlas of cell types in each brain structure, we paired high-throughput single-nucleus RNA-seq with Slide-seq, a recently developed spatial transcriptomics method with near-cellular resolution, across the entire mouse brain. Integration of these datasets revealed the cell type composition of each neuroanatomical structure. Cell type diversity was found to be remarkably high in the midbrain, hindbrain, and hypothalamus, with most clusters requiring a combination of at least three discrete gene expression markers to uniquely define them. Using these data, we developed a framework for genetically accessing each cell type, comprehensively characterized neuropeptide and neurotransmitter signaling, elucidated region-specific specializations in activity-regulated gene expression, and ascertained the heritability enrichment of neurological and psychiatric phenotypes. These data, available as an online resource (BrainCellData.org) should find diverse applications across neuroscience, including the construction of new genetic tools, and the prioritization of specific cell types and circuits in the study of brain diseases."
"36852609","Polygenic risk scores enhance prediction of body mass index increase in individuals with a first episode of psychosis.","Eur Psychiatry","Individuals with a first episode of psychosis (FEP) show rapid weight gain during the first months of treatment, which is associated with a reduction in general physical health. Although genetics is assumed to be a significant contributor to weight gain, its exact role is unknown.We assembled a population-based FEP cohort of 381 individuals that was split into a Training (n = 224) set and a Validation (n = 157) set to calculate the polygenic risk score (PRS) in a two-step process. In parallel, we obtained reference genome-wide association studies for body mass index (BMI) and schizophrenia (SCZ) to examine the pleiotropic landscape between the two traits. BMI PRSs were added to linear models that included sociodemographic and clinical variables to predict BMI increase (∆BMI) in the Validation set.The results confirmed considerable shared genetic susceptibility for the two traits involving 449 near-independent genomic loci. The inclusion of BMI PRSs significantly improved the prediction of ∆BMI at 12 months after the onset of antipsychotic treatment by 49.4% compared to a clinical model. In addition, we demonstrated that the PRS containing pleiotropic information between BMI and SCZ predicted ∆BMI better at 3 (12.2%) and 12 months (53.2%).We prove for the first time that genetic factors play a key role in determining ∆BMI during the FEP. This finding has important clinical implications for the early identification of individuals most vulnerable to weight gain and highlights the importance of examining genetic pleiotropy in the context of medically important comorbidities for predicting future outcomes."
"36945653","Dysregulation of Prefrontal Oligodendrocyte Lineage Cells Across Mouse Models of Adversity and Human Major Depressive Disorder.","bioRxiv","Animal models of adversity have yielded few molecular mechanisms that translate to human stress-related diseases like major depressive disorder (MDD). We congruently analyze publicly available bulk-tissue transcriptomic data from prefrontal cortex (PFC) in multiple mouse models of adversity and in MDD. We apply strategies, to quantify cell-type specific enrichment from bulk-tissue transcriptomics, utilizing reference single cell RNA sequencing datasets. These analyses reveal conserved patterns of oligodendrocyte (OL) dysregulation across animal experiments, including susceptibility to social defeat, acute cocaine withdrawal, chronic unpredictable stress, early life stress, and adolescent social isolation. Using unbiased methodologies, we further identify a dysregulation of layer 6 neurons that associate with deficits in goal-directed behavior after social isolation. Human post-mortem brains with MDD show similar OL transcriptome changes in Brodmann Areas 8/9 in both male and female patients. This work assesses cell type involvement in an unbiased manner from differential expression analyses across animal models of adversity and human MDD and finds a common signature of OL dysfunction in the frontal cortex."
"36757814","O-GlcNAc transferase in astrocytes modulates depression-related stress susceptibility through glutamatergic synaptic transmission.","J Clin Invest","Major depressive disorder is a common and devastating psychiatric disease, and the prevalence and burden are substantially increasing worldwide. Multiple studies of depression patients have implicated glucose metabolic dysfunction in the pathophysiology of depression. However, the molecular mechanisms by which glucose and related metabolic pathways modulate depressive-like behaviors are largely uncharacterized. Uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) is a glucose metabolite with pivotal functions as a donor molecule for O-GlcNAcylation. O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), a key enzyme in protein O-GlcNAcylation, catalyzes protein posttranslational modification by O-GlcNAc and acts as a stress sensor. Here, we show that Ogt mRNA was increased in depression patients and that astroglial OGT expression was specifically upregulated in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of susceptible mice after chronic social-defeat stress. The selective deletion of astrocytic OGT resulted in antidepressant-like effects, and moreover, astrocytic OGT in the mPFC bidirectionally regulated vulnerability to social stress. Furthermore, OGT modulated glutamatergic synaptic transmission through O-GlcNAcylation of glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) in astrocytes. OGT astrocyte-specific knockout preserved the neuronal morphology atrophy and Ca2+ activity deficits caused by chronic stress and resulted in antidepressant effects. Our study reveals that astrocytic OGT in the mPFC regulates depressive-like behaviors through the O-GlcNAcylation of GLT-1 and could be a potential target for antidepressants."
"37007096","DNA methylation accelerated age as captured by epigenetic clocks influences breast cancer risk.","Front Oncol","Breast cancer continues to be the leading form of cancer among women in the United States. Additionally, disparities across the breast cancer continuum continue to increase for women of historically marginalized populations. The mechanism driving these trends are unclear, however, accelerated biological age may provide key insights into better understanding these disease patterns. Accelerated age measured by DNA methylation using epigenetic clocks is to date the most robust method for estimating accelerated age. Here we synthesize the existing evidence on epigenetic clocks measurement of DNA methylation based accelerated age and breast cancer outcomes.Our database searches were conducted from January 2022 to April 2022 and yielded a total of 2,908 articles for consideration. We implemented methods derived from guidance of the PROSPERO Scoping Review Protocol to assess articles in the PubMed database on epigenetic clocks and breast cancer risk.Five articles were deemed appropriate for inclusion in this review. Ten epigenetic clocks were used across the five articles demonstrating statistically significant results for breast cancer risk. DNA methylation accelerated age varied by sample type. The studies did not consider social factors or epidemiological risk factors. The studies lacked representation of ancestrally diverse populations.DNA methylation based accelerated age as captured by epigenetic clocks has a statistically significant associative relationship with breast cancer risk, however, important social factors that contribute to patterns of methylation were not comprehensively considered in the available literature. More research is needed on DNA methylation based accelerated age across the lifespan including during menopausal transition and in diverse populations. This review demonstrates that DNA methylation accelerated age may provide key insights for tackling increasing rates of U.S. breast cancer incidence and overall disease disparities experienced by women from minoritized backgrounds.Copyright © 2023 Valencia, Saunders, Daw and Vasquez."
"36978899","Aging Hallmarks and the Role of Oxidative Stress.","Antioxidants (Basel)","Aging is a complex biological process accompanied by a progressive decline in the physical function of the organism and an increased risk of age-related chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. Studies have established that there exist nine hallmarks of the aging process, including (i) telomere shortening, (ii) genomic instability, (iii) epigenetic modifications, (iv) mitochondrial dysfunction, (v) loss of proteostasis, (vi) dysregulated nutrient sensing, (vii) stem cell exhaustion, (viii) cellular senescence, and (ix) altered cellular communication. All these alterations have been linked to sustained systemic inflammation, and these mechanisms contribute to the aging process in timing not clearly determined yet. Nevertheless, mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the most important mechanisms contributing to the aging process. Mitochondria is the primary endogenous source of reactive oxygen species (ROS). During the aging process, there is a decline in ATP production and elevated ROS production together with a decline in the antioxidant defense. Elevated ROS levels can cause oxidative stress and severe damage to the cell, organelle membranes, DNA, lipids, and proteins. This damage contributes to the aging phenotype. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the mechanisms of aging with an emphasis on mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS production."
"36982313","To Predict, Prevent, and Manage Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD): A Review of Pathophysiology, Treatment, and Biomarkers.","Int J Mol Sci","Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can become a chronic and severely disabling condition resulting in a reduced quality of life and increased economic burden. The disorder is directly related to exposure to a traumatic event, e.g., a real or threatened injury, death, or sexual assault. Extensive research has been done on the neurobiological alterations underlying the disorder and its related phenotypes, revealing brain circuit disruption, neurotransmitter dysregulation, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction. Psychotherapy remains the first-line treatment option for PTSD given its good efficacy, although pharmacotherapy can also be used as a stand-alone or in combination with psychotherapy. In order to reduce the prevalence and burden of the disorder, multilevel models of prevention have been developed to detect the disorder as early as possible and to reduce morbidity in those with established diseases. Despite the clinical grounds of diagnosis, attention is increasing to the discovery of reliable biomarkers that can predict susceptibility, aid diagnosis, or monitor treatment. Several potential biomarkers have been linked with pathophysiological changes related to PTSD, encouraging further research to identify actionable targets. This review highlights the current literature regarding the pathophysiology, disease development models, treatment modalities, and preventive models from a public health perspective, and discusses the current state of biomarker research."
"37009933","Predicting ExWAS findings from GWAS data: a shorter path to causal genes.","Hum Genet","GWAS has identified thousands of loci associated with disease, yet the causal genes within these loci remain largely unknown. Identifying these causal genes would enable deeper understanding of the disease and assist in genetics-based drug development. Exome-wide association studies (ExWAS) are more expensive but can pinpoint causal genes offering high-yield drug targets, yet suffer from a high false-negative rate. Several algorithms have been developed to prioritize genes at GWAS loci, such as the Effector Index (Ei), Locus-2-Gene (L2G), Polygenic Prioritization score (PoPs), and Activity-by-Contact score (ABC) and it is not known if these algorithms can predict ExWAS findings from GWAS data. However, if this were the case, thousands of associated GWAS loci could potentially be resolved to causal genes. Here, we quantified the performance of these algorithms by evaluating their ability to identify ExWAS significant genes for nine traits. We found that Ei, L2G, and PoPs can identify ExWAS significant genes with high areas under the precision recall curve (Ei: 0.52, L2G: 0.37, PoPs: 0.18, ABC: 0.14). Furthermore, we found that for every unit increase in the normalized scores, there was an associated 1.3-4.6-fold increase in the odds of a gene reaching exome-wide significance (Ei: 4.6, L2G: 2.5, PoPs: 2.1, ABC: 1.3). Overall, we found that Ei, L2G, and PoPs can anticipate ExWAS findings from widely available GWAS results. These techniques are therefore promising when well-powered ExWAS data are not readily available and can be used to anticipate ExWAS findings, allowing for prioritization of genes at GWAS loci.© 2023.

"37000167","The potential of integrating human and mouse discovery platforms to advance our understanding of cardiometabolic diseases.","Elife","Cardiometabolic diseases encompass a range of interrelated conditions that arise from underlying metabolic perturbations precipitated by genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. While obesity, dyslipidaemia, smoking, and insulin resistance are major risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases, individuals still present in the absence of such traditional risk factors, making it difficult to determine those at greatest risk of disease. Thus, it is crucial to elucidate the genetic, environmental, and molecular underpinnings to better understand, diagnose, and treat cardiometabolic diseases. Much of this information can be garnered using systems genetics, which takes population-based approaches to investigate how genetic variance contributes to complex traits. Despite the important advances made by human genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in this space, corroboration of these findings has been hampered by limitations including the inability to control environmental influence, limited access to pertinent metabolic tissues, and often, poor classification of diseases or phenotypes. A complementary approach to human GWAS is the utilisation of model systems such as genetically diverse mouse panels to study natural genetic and phenotypic variation in a controlled environment. Here, we review mouse genetic reference panels and the opportunities they provide for the study of cardiometabolic diseases and related traits. We discuss how the post-GWAS era has prompted a shift in focus from discovery of novel genetic variants to understanding gene function. Finally, we highlight key advantages and challenges of integrating complementary genetic and multi-omics data from human and mouse populations to advance biological discovery.© 2023, Jurrjens et al."
"36977987","Characterization of grain carotenoids in global sorghum germplasm to guide genomics-assisted breeding strategies.","BMC Plant Biol","Crop biofortification is a successful strategy to ameliorate Vitamin A deficiency. Sorghum is a good candidate for vitamin A biofortification, as it is a staple food in regions with high prevalence of vitamin A deficiency. β-carotene-the main provitamin A carotenoid-is below the target concentration in sorghum grain, therefore biofortification breeding is required. Previous studies found evidence that sorghum carotenoid variation is oligogenic, suggesting that marker-assisted selection can be an appropriate biofortification method. However, we hypothesize that sorghum carotenoids have both oligogenic and polygenic components of variation. Genomics-assisted breeding could accelerate breeding efforts, but there exists knowledge gaps in the genetics underlying carotenoid variation, as well as appropriate germplasm to serve as donors.In this study, we characterized carotenoids in 446 accessions from the sorghum association panel and carotenoid panel using high-performance liquid chromatography, finding high carotenoid accessions not previously identified. Genome-wide association studies conducted with 345 accessions, confirmed that zeaxanthin epoxidase is a major gene underlying variation for not only zeaxanthin, but also lutein and β-carotene. High carotenoid lines were found to have limited genetic diversity, and originated predominantly from only one country. Potential novel genetic diversity for carotenoid content was identified through genomic predictions in 2,495 accessions of unexplored germplasm. Oligogenic variation of carotenoids was confirmed, as well as evidence for polygenic variation, suggesting both marker-assisted selection and genomic selection can facilitate breeding efforts.Sorghum vitamin A biofortification could be beneficial for millions of people who rely on it as a dietary staple. Carotenoid content in sorghum is low, but high heritability suggests that increasing concentrations through breeding is possible. Low genetic diversity among high carotenoid lines might be the main limitation for breeding efforts, therefore further germplasm characterization is needed to assess the feasibility of biofortification breeding. Based on germplasm here evaluated, most countries' germplasm lacks high carotenoid alleles, thus pre-breeding will be needed. A SNP marker within the zeaxanthin epoxidase gene was identified as a good candidate for use in marker-assisted selection. Due to the oligogenic and polygenic variation of sorghum grain carotenoids, both marker-assisted selection and genomic selection can be employed to accelerate breeding efforts.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36975340","There's Plenty of Room Right Here: Biological Systems as Evolved, Overloaded, Multi-Scale Machines.","Biomimetics (Basel)","The applicability of computational models to the biological world is an active topic of debate. We argue that a useful path forward results from abandoning hard boundaries between categories and adopting an observer-dependent, pragmatic view. Such a view dissolves the contingent dichotomies driven by human cognitive biases (e.g., a tendency to oversimplify) and prior technological limitations in favor of a more continuous view, necessitated by the study of evolution, developmental biology, and intelligent machines. Form and function are tightly entwined in nature, and in some cases, in robotics as well. Thus, efforts to re-shape living systems for biomedical or bioengineering purposes require prediction and control of their function at multiple scales. This is challenging for many reasons, one of which is that living systems perform multiple functions in the same place at the same time. We refer to this as ""polycomputing""-the ability of the same substrate to simultaneously compute different things, and make those computational results available to different observers. This ability is an important way in which living things are a kind of computer, but not the familiar, linear, deterministic kind; rather, living things are computers in the broad sense of their computational materials, as reported in the rapidly growing physical computing literature. We argue that an observer-centered framework for the computations performed by evolved and designed systems will improve the understanding of mesoscale events, as it has already done at quantum and relativistic scales. To develop our understanding of how life performs polycomputing, and how it can be convinced to alter one or more of those functions, we can first create technologies that polycompute and learn how to alter their functions. Here, we review examples of biological and technological polycomputing, and develop the idea that the overloading of different functions on the same hardware is an important design principle that helps to understand and build both evolved and designed systems. Learning to hack existing polycomputing substrates, as well as to evolve and design new ones, will have massive impacts on regenerative medicine, robotics, and computer engineering."
"37004084","Disturbed circadian rhythm and retinal degeneration in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.","Acta Neuropathol Commun","The circadian clock is synchronized to the 24 h day by environmental light which is transmitted from the retina to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) primarily via the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT). Circadian rhythm abnormalities have been reported in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Whether these AD-related changes are a result of the altered clock gene expression, retina degeneration, including the dysfunction in RHT transmission, loss of retinal ganglion cells and its electrophysiological capabilities, or a combination of all of these pathological mechanisms, is not known. Here, we evaluated transgenic APP/PS1 mouse model of AD and wild-type mice at 6- and 12-month-old, as early and late pathological stage, respectively. We noticed the alteration of circadian clock gene expression not only in the hypothalamus but also in two extra-hypothalamic brain regions, cerebral cortex and hippocampus, in APP/PS1 mice. These alterations were observed in 6-month-old transgenic mice and were exacerbated at 12 months of age. This could be explained by the reduced RHT projections in the SCN of APP/PS1 mice, correlating with downregulation of hypothalamic GABAergic response in APP/PS1 mice in advanced stage of pathology. Importantly, we also report retinal degeneration in APP/PS1 mice, including Aβ deposits and reduced choline acetyltransferase levels, loss of melanopsin retinal ganglion cells and functional integrity mainly of inner retina layers. Our findings support the theory that retinal degeneration constitutes an early pathological event that directly affects the control of circadian rhythm in AD.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36811275","Polygenic risk score for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and brain functional networks segregation in a community-based sample.","Genes Brain Behav","Neuroimaging studies suggest that brain development mechanisms might explain at least some behavioural and cognitive attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms. However, the putative mechanisms by which genetic susceptibility factors influence clinical features via alterations of brain development remain largely unknown. Here, we set out to integrate genomics and connectomics tools by investigating the associations between an ADHD polygenic risk score (ADHD-PRS) and functional segregation of large-scale brain networks. With this aim, ADHD symptoms score, genetic and rs-fMRI (resting-state functional magnetic resonance image) data obtained in a longitudinal community-based cohort of 227 children and adolescents were analysed. A follow-up was conducted approximately 3 years after the baseline, with rs-fMRI scanning and ADHD likelihood assessment in both stages. We hypothesised a negative correlation between probable ADHD and the segregation of networks involved in executive functions, and a positive correlation with the default-mode network (DMN). Our findings suggest that ADHD-PRS is correlated with ADHD at baseline, but not at follow-up. Despite not surviving for multiple comparison correction, we found significant correlations between ADHD-PRS and segregation of cingulo-opercular networks and DMN at baseline. ADHD-PRS was negatively correlated with the segregation level of cingulo-opercular networks but positively correlated with the DMN segregation. These directions of associations corroborate the proposed counter-balanced role of attentional networks and DMN in attentional processes. However, the association between ADHD-PRS and brain networks functional segregation was not found at follow-up. Our results provide evidence for specific influences of genetic factors on development of attentional networks and DMN. We found significant correlations between polygenic risk score for ADHD (ADHD-PRS) and segregation of cingulo-opercular networks and default-mode network (DMN) at baseline. ADHD-PRS was negatively correlated with the segregation level of cingulo-opercular networks but positively correlated with the DMN segregation.© 2023 The Authors.

"36998476","Comparison between D-loop methylation and mtDNA copy number in patients with Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome.","Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)","Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome (AGS) is a rare encephalopathy with early onset that can be transmitted in both dominant and recessive forms. Its phenotypic covers a wide range of neurological and extraneurological symptoms. Nine genes that are all involved in nucleic acids (NAs) metabolism or signaling have so far been linked to the AGS phenotype. Recently, a link between autoimmune or neurodegenerative conditions and mitochondrial dysfunctions has been found. As part of the intricate system of epigenetic control, the mtDNA goes through various alterations. The displacement (D-loop) region represents one of the most methylated sites in the mtDNA. The term ""mitoepigenetics"" has been introduced as a result of increasing data suggesting that epigenetic processes may play a critical role in the control of mtDNA transcription and replication. Since we showed that RNASEH2B and RNASEH2A-mutated Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines (LCLs) derived from AGS patients had mitochondrial alterations, highlighting changes in the mtDNA content, the main objective of this study was to examine any potential methylation changes in the D-loop regulatory region of mitochondria and their relationship to the mtDNA copy number in peripheral blood cells of AGS patients with mutations in various AGS genes and healthy controls.We collected blood samples from 25 AGS patients and we performed RT-qPCR to assess the mtDNA copy number and pyrosequencing to measure DNA methylation levels in the D-loop region.Comparing AGS patients to healthy controls, D-loop methylation levels and mtDNA copy number increased significantly. We also observed that in AGS patients, the mtDNA copy number increased with age at sampling, but not the D-loop methylation levels, and there was no relationship between sex and mtDNA copy number. In addition, the D-loop methylation levels and mtDNA copy number in the AGS group showed a non-statistically significant positive relation.These findings, which contradict the evidence for an inverse relationship between D-loop methylation levels and mtDNA copy number, show that AGS patients have higher D-loop methylation levels than healthy control subjects. Additional research is needed to identify the function of these features in the etiology and course of AGS.Copyright © 2023 Dragoni, Garau, Orcesi, Varesio, Bordoni, Scarian, Di Gerlando, Fazzi, Battini, Gjurgjaj, Rizzo, Pansarasa and Gagliardi."
"36979161","Neurobiology of Aggression-Review of Recent Findings and Relationship with Alcohol and Trauma.","Biology (Basel)","Aggression can be conceptualized as any behavior, physical or verbal, that involves attacking another person or animal with the intent of causing harm, pain or injury. Because of its high prevalence worldwide, aggression has remained a central clinical and public safety issue. Aggression can be caused by several risk factors, including biological and psychological, such as genetics and mental health disorders, and socioeconomic such as education, employment, financial status, and neighborhood. Research over the past few decades has also proposed a link between alcohol consumption and aggressive behaviors. Alcohol consumption can escalate aggressive behavior in humans, often leading to domestic violence or serious crimes. Converging lines of evidence have also shown that trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) could have a tremendous impact on behavior associated with both alcohol use problems and violence. However, although the link between trauma, alcohol, and aggression is well documented, the underlying neurobiological mechanisms and their impact on behavior have not been properly discussed. This article provides an overview of recent advances in understanding the translational neurobiological basis of aggression and its intricate links to alcoholism and trauma, focusing on behavior. It does so by shedding light from several perspectives, including in vivo imaging, genes, receptors, and neurotransmitters and their influence on human and animal behavior."
"36982963","DNA Methylation Analysis Identifies Novel Epigenetic Loci in Dilated Murine Heart upon Exposure to Volume Overload.","Int J Mol Sci","Left ventricular (LV) dilatation, a prominent risk factor for heart failure (HF), precedes functional deterioration and is used to stratify patients at risk for arrhythmias and cardiac mortality. Aberrant DNA methylation contributes to maladaptive cardiac remodeling and HF progression following pressure overload and ischemic cardiac insults. However, no study has examined cardiac DNA methylation upon exposure to volume overload (VO) despite being relatively common among HF patients. We carried out global methylome analysis of LV harvested at a decompensated HF stage following exposure to VO induced by aortocaval shunt. VO resulted in pathological cardiac remodeling, characterized by massive LV dilatation and contractile dysfunction at 16 weeks after shunt. Although methylated DNA was not markedly altered globally, 25 differentially methylated promoter regions (DMRs) were identified in shunt vs. sham hearts (20 hypermethylated and 5 hypomethylated regions). The validated hypermethylated loci in Junctophilin-2 (Jph2), Signal peptidase complex subunit 3 (Spcs3), Vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein B (Vapb), and Inositol polyphosphate multikinase (Ipmk) were associated with the respective downregulated expression and were consistently observed in dilated LV early after shunt at 1 week after shunt, before functional deterioration starts to manifest. These hypermethylated loci were also detected peripherally in the blood of the shunt mice. Altogether, we have identified conserved DMRs that could be novel epigenetic biomarkers in dilated LV upon VO exposure."

Using a Transcriptomics Approach.","Genes (Basel)","Phellodendron amurenseRupr., a species of Rutaceae, is a nationally protected and valuable medicinal plant. It is generally considered to be dioecious. With the discovery of monoeciousP. amurense, the phenomenon that its sex development is regulated by epigenetics has been revealed, but the way epigenetics affects the sex differentiation ofP. amurenseis still unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of DNA methylation on the sexual development ofP. amurense. The young inflorescences of male plants were treated with the demethylation agent 5-azaC, and the induced female flowers were obtained. The induced female flowers' morphological functions and transcriptome levels were close to those of normally developed plants. Genes associated with the development of female flowers were studied by comparing the differences in transcriptome levels between the male and female flowers. Referring to sex-related genes reported in other plants, 188 candidate genes related to the development of female flowers were obtained, including sex-regulating genes, genes related to the formation and development of sexual organs, genes related to biochemical pathways, and hormone-related genes.RPP0W,PAL3,MCM2,MCM6,SUP,PIN1,AINTEGUMENTA,AINTEGUMENTA-LIKE6,AGL11,SEUSS,SHI-RELATED SEQUENCE 5, andESR2were preliminarily considered the key genes for female flower development. This study has demonstrated that epigenetics was involved in the sex regulation ofP. amurense, with DNA methylation as one of its regulatory modes. Moreover, some candidate genes related to the sexual differentiation ofP. amurensewere obtained with analysis. These results are of great significance for further exploring the mechanism of sex differentiation ofP. amurenseand studying of sex differentiation of plants."

Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been investigated as a standardized biomarker that can be used to predict outcomes of TBI. The aim of this review was to determine the prognostic utility of NLR among patients admitted for TBI. (2) Methods: A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science in November 2022 to retrieve articles regarding the use of neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) as a prognostic measure in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients. Inclusion criteria included studies reporting outcomes of TBI patients with associated NLR values. Exclusion criteria were studies reporting only non-primary data, those insufficiently disaggregated to extract NLR data, and non-English or cadaveric studies. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was utilized to assess for the presence of bias in included studies. (3) Results: Following the final study selection 19 articles were included for quantitative and qualitative analysis. The average age was 46.25 years. Of the 7750 patients, 73% were male. Average GCS at presentation was 10.51. There was no significant difference in the NLR between surgical vs. non-surgical cohorts (SMD 2.41 95% CI -1.82 to 6.63,p= 0.264). There was no significant difference in the NLR between bleeding vs. non-bleeding cohorts (SMD 4.84 95% CI -0.26 to 9.93,p= 0.0627). There was a significant increase in the NLR between favorable vs. non-favorable cohorts (SMD 1.31 95% CI 0.33 to 2.29,p= 0.0090). (4) Conclusions: Our study found that NLR was only significantly predictive for adverse outcomes in TBI patients and not surgical treatment or intracranial hemorrhage, making it nonetheless an affordable alternative for physicians to assess patient prognosis."

This knowledge greatly stems from assessing disrupted mother-child relationships, while studies investigating the long-term effects of father-child relationships on behavioral development in children are scarce. However, available evidence suggests that fathers may uniquely influence a child's behavioral development in a sex-specific manner. Rodent models examining mother-offspring interaction demonstrate relationships among ELS, neuroinflammatory mediators, and behavioral development; yet, the role paternal care may play in neuroimmune functioning remains unreported.Using the biparental California mouse (Peromyscus californicus), we examined to what extent paternal deprivation impairs social and anxiety-like behaviors, augments peripheral corticosterone (CORT) response, and alters central proinflammatory cytokine production following an acute stressor in adulthood.Biparentally reared and paternally deprived (permanent removal of the sire 24 h post-birth) adult mice were assessed for sociability, preference for social novelty, social vigilance, and social avoidance behaviors, followed by novelty-suppressed feeding (NSF) testing for general anxiety-like behavior. Following an acute stressor, circulating CORT concentrations and region-specific proinflammatory cytokine concentrations were determined via radioimmunoassay and Luminex multianalyte analysis, respectively.In response to a novel same-sex conspecific, social vigilance behavior was associated with reduced sociability and increased avoidance in paternally deprived mice-an effect not observed in biparentally reared counterparts. Yet, in response to a familiar same-sex conspecific, social vigilance persisted but only in paternally deprived females. The latency to consume during NSF testing was not significantly altered by paternal deprivation. In response to an acute physical stressor, lower circulating CORT concentrations were observed in paternally deprived females. Compared to control-reared males, paternal deprivation increased hypothalamic interleukin-1β, but decreased hippocampal IL-6 protein concentration.Greater social vigilance behavior was demonstrated in paternally deprived mice while they avoided social interaction with a novel same-sex conspecific; however, in response to a familiar same-sex conspecific, paternal deprivation increased social vigilance behavior but only in females. It is possible that different neurobiological mechanisms underlie these observed behavioral outcomes as sex-specific central proinflammatory cytokine and stress responsivity were observed in paternally deprived offspring.© 2023.

"36978802","Anti-Inflammatory Effect of Caffeine on Muscle under Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Inflammation.","Antioxidants (Basel)","Evidence has shown that caffeine administration reduces pro-inflammatory biomarkers, delaying fatigue and improving endurance performance. This study examined the effects of caffeine administration on the expression of inflammatory-, adenosine receptor- (the targets of caffeine), epigenetic-, and oxidative metabolism-linked genes in thevastus lateralismuscle of mice submitted to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation. We showed that caffeine pre-treatment before LPS administration reduced the expression ofIl1b,Il6, andTnfa, and increasedIl10andIl13. The negative modulation of the inflammatory response induced by caffeine involved the reduction of inflammasome components,AscandCasp1, promoting an anti-inflammatory scenario. Caffeine treatmentper sepromoted the upregulation of adenosinergic receptors,Adora1andAdora2A, an effect that was counterbalanced by LPS. Moreover, there was observed a markedAdora2Apromoter hypermethylation, which could represent a compensatory response towards the increasedAdora2Aexpression. Though caffeine administration did not alter DNA methylation patterns, the expression of DNA demethylating enzymes,Tet1andTet2, was increased in mice receiving Caffeine+LPS, when compared with the basal condition. Finally, caffeine administration attenuated the LPS-induced catabolic state, by rescuing basal levels ofAmpkexpression. Altogether, the anti-inflammatory effects of caffeine in the muscle can be mediated by modifications on the epigenetic landscape."

We cannot underestimate the progress in understanding the major cardiovascular risk factors which include cigarette smoking, dietary, and sedentary lifestyle risks. Despite their clinical significance, these modifiable risk factors are still the major contributors to cardiovascular disease. It is, therefore, important to understand the specific molecular mechanisms behind their pathological effects to develop new therapies to improve the treatment of cardiovascular disease. In recent years, our group and others have made a progress in understanding how these risk factors can promote endothelial dysfunction, smooth muscle dysregulation, vascular inflammation, hypertension, lung, and heart diseases. These factors, despite differences in their nature, lead to stereotypical alterations in vascular metabolism and function. Interestingly, cigarette smoking has a tremendous impact on a very distant site from the initial epithelial exposure, namely circulation and vascular cells mediated by a variety of stable cigarette smoke components which promote vascular oxidative stress and alter vascular metabolism and function. Similarly, dietary and sedentary lifestyle risks facilitate vascular cell metabolic reprogramming promoting vascular oxidative stress and dysfunction. Mitochondria are critical in cellular metabolism, and in this work, we discuss a new concept that mitochondria are a common pathobiological target for these risk factors, and mitochondria-targeted treatments may have a therapeutic effect in the patients with cardiovascular disease.© 2023.

"36983246","The Biology of Stress Intolerance in Patients with Chronic Pain-State of the Art and Future Directions.","J Clin Med","Stress has been consistently linked to negative impacts on physical and mental health. More specifically, patients with chronic pain experience stress intolerance, which is an exacerbation or occurrence of symptoms in response to any type of stress. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unsolved. In this state-of-the-art paper, we summarised the role of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the two major stress response systems in stress intolerance. We provided insights into such mechanisms based on evidence from clinical studies in both patients with chronic pain, showing dysregulated stress systems, and healthy controls supported by preclinical studies, highlighting the link between these systems and symptoms of stress intolerance. Furthermore, we explored the possible regulating role for (epi)genetic mechanisms influencing the ANS and HPA axis. The link between stress and chronic pain has become an important area of research as it has the potential to inform the development of interventions to improve the quality of life for individuals living with chronic pain. As stress has become a prevalent concern in modern society, understanding the connection between stress, HPA axis, ANS, and chronic health conditions such as chronic pain is crucial to improve public health and well-being."

We found that iRBDs tended to be epigenetically older than controls, suggesting that accelerated aging characterizes prodromal neurodegeneration.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36982858","Elucidation of OSW-1-Induced Stress Responses in Neuro2a Cells.","Int J Mol Sci","OSW-1, a steroidal saponin isolated from the bulbs of Ornithogalum saundersiae, is a promising compound for an anticancer drug; however, its cytotoxic mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Therefore, we analyzed the stress responses triggered by OSW-1 in the mouse neuroblastoma cell line Neuro2a by comparing it with brefeldin A (BFA), a Golgi apparatus-disrupting reagent. Among the Golgi stress sensors TFE3/TFEB and CREB3, OSW-1 induced dephosphorylation of TFE3/TFEB but not cleavage of CREB3, and induction of the ER stress-inducible genes GADD153 and GADD34 was slight. On the other hand, the induction of LC3-II, an autophagy marker, was more pronounced than the BFA stimulation. To elucidate OSW-1-induced gene expression, we performed a comprehensive gene analysis using a microarray method and observed changes in numerous genes involved in lipid metabolism, such as cholesterol, and in the regulation of the ER-Golgi apparatus. Abnormalities in ER-Golgi transport were also evident in the examination of secretory activity using NanoLuc-tag genes. Finally, we established Neuro2a cells lacking oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP), which were severely reduced by OSW-1, but found OSBP deficiency had little effect on OSW-1-induced cell death and the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio in Neuro2a cells. Future work to elucidate the relationship between OSW-1-induced atypical Golgi stress responses and autophagy induction may lead to the development of new anticancer agents."
"36980837","Exposure to Juvenile Stress Induces Epigenetic Alterations in the GABAergic System in Rats.","Genes (Basel)","Epigenetics is a gene-environment interaction mechanism, manifested mostly through changes in regulatory gene expression. Stress is an established environmental factor known to induce epigenetic changes. This study aimed to assess the long-term effect of stress as juveniles, or juvenile and adult stress, on alterations in glutamic acid decarboxylase genes (GAD65,GAD67). We assessed DNA methylation and RNA expression in four rat groups: (1) control group, (2) juvenile stress group sacrificed two days following stress exposure (JSe) (RNA only), (3) juvenile stress group sacrificed as adults (JS), and (4) juvenile and adult stress group (JS + AS). Three different areas of the brain were examined in each group: the dorsal dentate gyrus (dDG), the dorsal CA1 (dCA1), and the basolateral amygdala (BLA). A significantly low methylation level ofGAD65in the BLA was observed among the JS group, followed by almost complete recovery among the JS + AS group. However, in dDG, an opposite trend was captured, and higherGAD65methylation was found in JS. In addition, RNA levels were found to be decreased in JS compared to JSe and JS + AS. These findings can point to a possible mechanism: while juvenile stress may enhance a better coping strategy with life challenges, additional stress in adulthood may trigger a contradictory response, either beneficial or harmful."

Previous work assessing risk factor-associated alterations to DNA methylation in breast tissue has been limited, with even less published research in breast milk, a noninvasively obtained biospecimen containing sloughed mammary epithelial cells that may identify early alterations indicative of cancer risk.Here, we present a novel library for the estimation of the cellular composition of breast tissue and milk and subsequent assessment of cell-type-independent alterations to DNA methylation associated with established breast cancer-risk factors in solid breast tissue (n = 95) and breast milk (n = 48) samples using genome-scale DNA methylation measures from the Illumina HumanMethylation450 array.We identified 772 hypermethylated CpGs (P < 0.01) associated with age consistent between breast tissue and breast milk samples. Age-associated hypermethylated CpG loci were significantly enriched for CpG island shore regions known to be important for regulating gene expression. Among the overlapping hypermethylated loci mapping to genes, a differentially methylated region was identified in the promoter region of SFRP2, a gene observed to undergo promoter hypermethylation in breast cancer.Our findings suggest the potential to identify epigenetic biomarkers of breast cancer risk in noninvasively obtained, tissue-specific breast milk specimens.This work demonstrates the potential of using breast milk as a noninvasive biomarker of breast cancer risk, improving our ability to detect early-stage disease and lowering the overall disease burden.©2023 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research."

But multi-omic traits can be genetically predicted, which enables highly cost-effective and powerful analyses for studies that do not have multi-omics1. Here we examine a large cohort (the INTERVAL study2; n = 50,000 participants) with extensive multi-omic data for plasma proteomics (SomaScan, n = 3,175; Olink, n = 4,822), plasma metabolomics (Metabolon HD4, n = 8,153), serum metabolomics (Nightingale, n = 37,359) and whole-blood Illumina RNA sequencing (n = 4,136), and use machine learning to train genetic scores for 17,227 molecular traits, including 10,521 that reach Bonferroni-adjusted significance. We evaluate the performance of genetic scores through external validation across cohorts of individuals of European, Asian and African American ancestries. In addition, we show the utility of these multi-omic genetic scores by quantifying the genetic control of biological pathways and by generating a synthetic multi-omic dataset of the UK Biobank3to identify disease associations using a phenome-wide scan. We highlight a series of biological insights with regard to genetic mechanisms in metabolism and canonical pathway associations with disease; for example, JAK-STAT signalling and coronary atherosclerosis. Finally, we develop a portal ( https://www.omicspred.org/ ) to facilitate public access to all genetic scores and validation results, as well as to serve as a platform for future extensions and enhancements of multi-omic genetic scores.© 2023.

Most current TWAS methods analyze one gene at a time, ignoring the correlations between multiple genes. Few of the existing TWAS methods focus on survival outcomes. Here, we propose a novel method, namely a COx proportional hazards model for NEtwork regression in TWAS (CoNet), that is applicable for identifying the association between one given network and the survival time. CoNet considers the general relationship among the predicted gene expression as edges of the network and quantifies it through pointwise mutual information (PMI), which is under a two-stage TWAS. Extensive simulation studies illustrate that CoNet can not only achieve type I error calibration control in testing both the node effect and edge effect, but it can also gain more power compared with currently available methods. In addition, it demonstrates superior performance in real data application, namely utilizing the breast cancer survival data of UK Biobank. CoNet effectively accounts for network structure and can simultaneously identify the potential effecting nodes and edges that are related to survival outcomes in TWAS."
"36945657","A bootstrap model comparison test for identifying genes with context-specific patterns of genetic regulation.","bioRxiv","Understanding how genetic variation affects gene expression is essential for a complete picture of the functional pathways that give rise to complex traits. Although numerous studies have established that many genes are differentially expressed in distinct human tissues and cell types, no tools exist for identifying the genes whose expression is differentially regulated. Here we introduce DRAB (Differential Regulation Analysis by Bootstrapping), a gene-based method for testing whether patterns of genetic regulation are significantly different between tissues or other biological contexts. DRAB first leverages the elastic net to learn context-specific models of local genetic regulation and then applies a novel bootstrap-based model comparison test to check their equivalency. Unlike previous model comparison tests, our proposed approach can determine whether population-level models have equal predictive performance by accounting for the variability of feature selection and model training. We validated DRAB on mRNA expression data from a variety of human tissues in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project. DRAB yielded biologically reasonable results and had sufficient power to detect genes with tissue-specific regulatory profiles while effectively controlling false positives. By providing a framework that facilitates the prioritization of differentially regulated genes, our study enables future discoveries on the genetic architecture of molecular phenotypes."

However, prioritizing the specific risk genes and candidate molecular mechanisms underlying these genetic enrichments has been hindered by the lack of a single unified large-scale gene regulatory atlas of human brain development. Here, we uniformly process and systematically characterize gene, isoform, and splicing quantitative trait loci (xQTLs) in 672 fetal brain samples from unique subjects across multiple ancestral populations. We identify 15,752 genes harboring a significant xQTL and map 3,739 eQTLs to a specific cellular context. We observe a striking drop in gene expression and splicing heritability as the human brain develops. Isoform-level regulation, particularly in the second trimester, mediates the greatest proportion of heritability across multiple psychiatric GWAS, compared with eQTLs. Via colocalization and TWAS, we prioritize biological mechanisms for ~60% of GWAS loci across five neuropsychiatric disorders, nearly two-fold that observed in the adult brain. Finally, we build a comprehensive set of developmentally regulated gene and isoform co-expression networks capturing unique genetic enrichments across disorders. Together, this work provides a comprehensive view of genetic regulation across human brain development as well as the stage- and cell type-informed mechanistic underpinnings of neuropsychiatric disorders."

Evolutionary constraint is a powerful predictor of function that is agnostic to cell type or disease mechanism. Here, single base phyloP scores from the whole genome alignment of 240 placental mammals identified 3.5% of the human genome as significantly constrained, and likely functional. We compared these scores to large-scale genome annotation, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), copy number variation, clinical genetics findings, and cancer data sets. Evolutionarily constrained positions are enriched for variants explaining common disease heritability (more than any other functional annotation). Our results improve variant annotation but also highlight that the regulatory landscape of the human genome still needs to be further explored and linked to disease."

It is calculated based on the contents of residual glycogen and glucose (RG), glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), and lactate (LAT) contents in muscle. However, the genetic mechanism of glycolytic metabolism in skeletal muscle of pigs remains poorly understood. With a history of more than 400 years and some unique characteristics, the Erhualian pig is called the ""giant panda"" (very precious) in the world's pig species by Chinese animal husbandry.Methods:Here, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using 1.4M single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) chips for longissimus RG, G6P, LAT, and GP levels in 301 purebred Erhualian pigs.Results:We found that the average GP value of Erhualian was unusually low (68.09 μmol/g), but the variation was large (10.4-112.7 μmol/g). The SNP-based heritability estimates for the four traits ranged from 0.16-0.32. In total, our GWAS revealed 31 quantitative trait loci (QTLs), including eight for RG, nine for G6P, nine for LAT, five for GP. Of these loci, eight were genome-wide significant (p< 3.8 × 10-7), and six loci were common to two or three traits. Multiple promising candidate genes such asFTO,MINPP1,RIPOR2,SCL8A3,LIFRandSRGAP1were identified. The genotype combinations of the five GP-associated SNPs also showed significant effect on other meat quality traits.Discussion:These results not only provide insights into the genetic architecture of GP related traits in Erhualian, but also are useful for pig breeding programs involving this breed.Copyright © 2023 Xie, Huang, Huang, Zou, Zhou, Ai, Huang and Ma."

However, the causal relationships underlying this association are still unclear. Physical activity can enhance brain functions, but healthy cognition may also promote engagement in physical activity. Here, we assessed the bidirectional relationships between physical activity and general cognitive functioning using Latent Heritable Confounder Mendelian Randomization (LHC-MR). Association data were drawn from two large-scale genome-wide association studies (UK Biobank and COGENT) on accelerometer-measured moderate, vigorous, and average physical activity (N = 91,084) and cognitive functioning (N = 257,841). After Bonferroni correction, we observed significant LHC-MR associations suggesting that increased fraction of both moderate (b = 0.32, CI95% = [0.17,0.47], P = 2.89e - 05) and vigorous physical activity (b = 0.22, CI95% = [0.06,0.37], P = 0.007) lead to increased cognitive functioning. In contrast, we found no evidence of a causal effect of average physical activity on cognitive functioning, and no evidence of a reverse causal effect (cognitive functioning on any physical activity measures). These findings provide new evidence supporting a beneficial role of moderate and vigorous physical activity (MVPA) on cognitive functioning.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Discovery of genetic loci associated with multiple diseases can simultaneously support general interventions. Several meta-analyses have shown genetic associations with gastric cancer (GC); however, no study has identified associations with other phenotypes using this approach.Here, we applied disease network analysis and gene-based analysis (GBA) to examine genetic variants linked to GC and simultaneously associated with other phenotypes. We conducted a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) level meta-analysis and GBA through a systematic genome-wide association study (GWAS) linked to GC, to integrate published results for the SNP variants and group them into major GC-associated genes. We then performed disease network and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses to evaluate cross-phenotype associations and expression levels of GC-related genes.Seven genes (MTX1, GBAP1, MUC1, TRIM46, THBS3, PSCA, and ABO) were associated with GC as well as blood urea nitrogen (BUN), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and uric acid (UA). In addition, 17 SNPs regulated the expression of genes located on 1q22, 24 SNPs regulated the expression of PSCA on 8q24.3, and rs7849820 regulated the expression of ABO on 9q34.2. Furthermore, rs1057941 and rs2294008 had the highest posterior causal probabilities of being a causal candidate SNP in 1q22, and 8q24.3, respectively.These findings identified seven GC-associated genes exhibiting a cross-association with GFR, BUN, and UA.© 2023.

"36940203","Genome-wide association study identifies four pan-ancestry loci for suicidal ideation in the Million Veteran Program.","PLoS Genet","Suicidal ideation (SI) often precedes and predicts suicide attempt and death, is the most common suicidal phenotype and is over-represented in veterans. The genetic architecture of SI in the absence of suicide attempt (SA) is unknown, yet believed to have distinct and overlapping risk with other suicidal behaviors. We performed the first GWAS of SI without SA in the Million Veteran Program (MVP), identifying 99,814 SI cases from electronic health records without a history of SA or suicide death (SD) and 512,567 controls without SI, SA or SD. GWAS was performed separately in the four largest ancestry groups, controlling for sex, age and genetic substructure. Ancestry-specific results were combined via meta-analysis to identify pan-ancestry loci. Four genome-wide significant (GWS) loci were identified in the pan-ancestry meta-analysis with loci on chromosomes 6 and 9 associated with suicide attempt in an independent sample. Pan-ancestry gene-based analysis identified GWS associations with DRD2, DCC, FBXL19, BCL7C, CTF1, ANNK1, and EXD3. Gene-set analysis implicated synaptic and startle response pathways (q's<0.05). European ancestry (EA) analysis identified GWS loci on chromosomes 6 and 9, as well as GWS gene associations in EXD3, DRD2, and DCC. No other ancestry-specific GWS results were identified, underscoring the need to increase representation of diverse individuals. The genetic correlation of SI and SA within MVP was high (rG = 0.87; p = 1.09e-50), as well as with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; rG = 0.78; p = 1.98e-95) and major depressive disorder (MDD; rG = 0.78; p = 8.33e-83). Conditional analysis on PTSD and MDD attenuated most pan-ancestry and EA GWS signals for SI without SA to nominal significance, with the exception of EXD3 which remained GWS. Our novel findings support a polygenic and complex architecture for SI without SA which is largely shared with SA and overlaps with psychiatric conditions frequently comorbid with suicidal behaviors.Copyright: This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

"36909521","Interpreting population and family-based genome-wide association studies in the presence of confounding.","bioRxiv","A central aim of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) is to estimate direct genetic effects: the causal effects on an individual's phenotype of the alleles that they carry. However, estimates of direct effects can be subject to genetic and environmental confounding, and can also absorb the 'indirect' genetic effects of relatives' genotypes. Recently, an important development in controlling for these confounds has been the use of within-family GWASs, which, because of the randomness of Mendelian segregation within pedigrees, are often interpreted as producing unbiased estimates of direct effects. Here, we present a general theoretical analysis of the influence of confounding in standard population-based and within-family GWASs. We show that, contrary to common interpretation, family-based estimates of direct effects can be biased by genetic confounding. In humans, such biases will often be small per-locus, but can be compounded when effect size estimates are used in polygenic scores. We illustrate the influence of genetic confounding on population- and family-based estimates of direct effects using models of assortative mating, population stratification, and stabilizing selection on GWAS traits. We further show how family-based estimates of indirect genetic effects, based on comparisons of parentally transmitted and untransmitted alleles, can suffer substantial genetic confounding. In addition to known biases that can arise in family-based GWASs when interactions between family members are ignored, we show that biases can also arise from gene-by-environment (G×E) interactions when parental genotypes are not distributed identically across interacting environmental and genetic backgrounds. We conclude that, while family-based studies have placed GWAS estimation on a more rigorous footing, they carry subtle issues of interpretation that arise from confounding and interactions."

The NSD2 mutation leads to widespread remodeling of the 3D genome, most dramatically in terms of compartment changes with a strong bias towards A compartment shifts. Systematic integration of the Hi-C data with previously published ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, and ChIP-seq data show an expansion in H3K36me2 and a shrinkage in H3K27me3 within A compartments as well as increased gene expression and chromatin accessibility. These results suggest that NSD2 EK plays a prominent role in chromatin decompaction through enrichment of H3K36me2. In contrast, we identify few changes in intra-topologically associating domain activity. While compartment changes vary across cell lines, a common core of decompacting loci are shared, driving the expression of genes/pathways previously implicated in drug resistance. We further perform RNA sequencing on a cohort of matched diagnosis/relapse ALL patients harboring the relapse-specific NSD2 EK mutation. Changes in patient gene expression upon relapse significantly correlate with core compartment changes, further implicating the role of NSD2 EK in genome decompaction.In spite of cell-context-dependent changes mediated by EK, there appears to be a shared transcriptional program dependent on compartment shifts which could explain phenotypic differences across EK cell lines. This core program is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Machine learning methods have emerged recently as a powerful tool to solve this problem. State-of-the-art approaches allow prediction of transcriptional and epigenetic effects caused by noncoding mutations. However, these approaches require specific experimental data for training and cannot generalize across cell types where required features were not experimentally measured. We show here that available epigenetic characteristics of human cell types are extremely sparse, limiting those approaches that rely on specific epigenetic input. We propose a new neural network architecture, DeepCT, which can learn complex interconnections of epigenetic features and infer unmeasured data from any available input.

The aim of this study is to identify functional genes and pathways that distinguish BD Li responders (LR) from BD Li non-responders (NR). An initial Pharmacogenomics of Bipolar Disorder study (PGBD) GWAS of lithium response did not provide any significant results. As a result, we then employed network-based integrative analysis of transcriptomic and genomic data. In transcriptomic study of iPSC-derived neurons, 41 significantly differentially expressed (DE) genes were identified in LR vs NR regardless of lithium exposure. In the PGBD, post-GWAS gene prioritization using the GWA-boosting (GWAB) approach identified 1119 candidate genes. Following DE-derived network propagation, there was a highly significant overlap of genes between the top 500- and top 2000-proximal gene networks and the GWAB gene list (Phypergeometric = 1.28E-09 and 4.10E-18, respectively). Functional enrichment analyses of the top 500 proximal network genes identified focal adhesion and the extracellular matrix (ECM) as the most significant functions. Our findings suggest that the difference between LR and NR was a much greater effect than that of lithium. The direct impact of dysregulation of focal adhesion on axon guidance and neuronal circuits could underpin mechanisms of response to lithium, as well as underlying BD. It also highlights the power of integrative multi-omics analysis of transcriptomic and genomic profiling to gain molecular insights into lithium response in BD.© 2023. The Author(s)."

We demonstrate superior performances with ChromTransfer for learning cell-type specific chromatin accessibility from sequence compared to models not informed by a pre-trained model. Importantly, ChromTransfer enables fine-tuning on small input data with minimal decrease in accuracy. We show that ChromTransfer uses sequence features matching binding site sequences of key transcription factors for prediction.

Here, we aimed to address this gap by integrating GWAS data with single-cell and bulk chromatin accessibility data and histone modification profiles from immune and nervous systems. MS-GWAS associations are significantly enriched in regulatory regions of microglia and peripheral immune cell subtypes, especially B cells and monocytes. Cell-specific polygenic risk scores were developed to examine the cumulative impact of the susceptibility genes on MS risk and clinical phenotypes, showing significant associations with risk and brain white matter volume. The findings reveal enrichment of GWAS signals in B cell and monocyte/microglial cell-types, consistent with the known pathology and presumed targets of effective MS therapeutics.© 2023.

"36945621","Analysis of histone antibody specificity directly in sequencing data using siQ-ChIP.","bioRxiv","We previously developed sans spike-in quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (siQ-ChIP), a technique that introduces an absolute quantitative scale to ChIP-seq data without reliance on spike-in normalization approaches. The physical model of siQ-ChIP predicted that the IP step of ChIP would produce a classical binding isotherm when antibody or epitope was titrated. Here, we define experimental conditions in which this titration is observable for antibodies that recognize modified states of histone proteins. We show that minimally sequenced points along an isotherm can reveal differential binding specificities that are associated with on- and off-target epitope interactions. This work demonstrates that the interpretation of histone post-translational modification distribution from ChIP-seq data has a dependence on antibody concentration. Collectively, these studies introduce a simplified and reproducible experimental method to generate quantitative ChIP-seq data without spike-in normalization and demonstrate that histone antibody specificity can be analyzed directly in ChIP-seq experiments."
"36945558","Sequence characteristics and an accurate model of high-occupancy target loci in the human genome.","bioRxiv","Enhancers and promoters are considered to be bound by a small set of TFs in a sequence-specific manner. This assumption has come under increasing skepticism as the datasets of ChIP-seq assays have expanded. Particularly, high-occupancy target (HOT) loci attract hundreds of TFs with seemingly no detectable correlation between ChIP-seq peaks and DNA-binding motif presence. Here, we used 1,003 TF ChIP-seq datasets in HepG2, K562, and H1 cells to analyze the patterns of ChIP-seq peak co-occurrence combined with functional genomics datasets. We identified 43,891 HOT loci forming at the promoter (53%) and enhancer (47%) regions and determined that HOT promoters regulate housekeeping genes, whereas the HOT enhancers are involved in extremely tissue-specific processes. HOT loci form the foundation of human super-enhancers and evolve under strong negative selection, with some of them being ultraconserved regions. Sequence-based classification of HOT loci using deep learning suggests that their formation is driven by sequence features, and the density of ChIP-seq peaks correlates with sequence features. Based on their affinities to bind to promoters and enhancers, we detected five distinct clusters of TFs that form the core of the HOT loci. We also observed that HOT loci are enriched in 3D chromatin hubs and disease-causal variants. In a challenge to the classical model of enhancer activity, we report an abundance of HOT loci in human genome and a commitment of 51% of all ChIP-seq binding events to HOT locus formation and propose a model of HOT locus formation based on the existence of large transcriptional condensates."

The use of functional annotation has been able to improve the power of genomic models.We sought to leverage genomic functional annotations to build tissue-specific AD PRS models and study their relationship with AD and its biomarkers.We built 13 tissue-specific AD PRS and studied the scores' relationships with AD diagnosis, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid, CSF tau, and other CSF biomarkers in two longitudinal cohort studies of AD.The AD PRS model that was most predictive of AD diagnosis (even without APOE) was the liver AD PRS: n = 1,115; odds ratio = 2.15 (1.67-2.78), p = 3.62×10-9. The liver AD PRS was also statistically significantly associated with cerebrospinal fluid biomarker evidence of amyloid-β (Aβ42:Aβ40 ratio, p = 3.53×10-6) and the phosphorylated tau:amyloid-β ratio (p = 1.45×10-5).These findings provide further evidence of the role of the liver-functional genome in AD and the benefits of incorporating functional annotation into genomic research."

Its underlying mechanisms are correlated with age-dependent diseases, especially neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and multiple sclerosis (MS) that are accompanied by social and financial difficulties for patients. Over time, people not only become more prone to neurodegeneration but they also lose the ability to trigger pivotal restorative mechanisms. In this review, we attempt to present the already known molecular and cellular hallmarks that characterize ageing in association with their impact on the central nervous system (CNS)'s structure and function intensifying possible preexisting pathogenetic conditions. A thorough and elucidative study of the underlying mechanisms of ageing will be able to contribute further to the development of new therapeutic interventions to effectively treat age-dependent manifestations of neurodegenerative diseases."
"36992770","The role of maternal DNA methylation in pregnancies complicated by gestational diabetes.","Front Clin Diabetes Healthc","Diabetes in pregnancy is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes and poses a serious threat to the health of mother and child. Although the pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie the association between maternal diabetes and pregnancy complications have not yet been elucidated, it has been suggested that the frequency and severity of pregnancy complications are linked to the degree of hyperglycemia. Epigenetic mechanisms reflect gene-environment interactions and have emerged as key players in metabolic adaptation to pregnancy and the development of complications. DNA methylation, the best characterized epigenetic mechanism, has been reported to be dysregulated during various pregnancy complications, including pre-eclampsia, hypertension, diabetes, early pregnancy loss and preterm birth. The identification of altered DNA methylation patterns may serve to elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie the different types of maternal diabetes during pregnancy. This review aims to provide a summary of existing knowledge on DNA methylation patterns in pregnancies complicated by pregestational type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Four databases, CINAHL, Scopus, PubMed and Google Scholar, were searched for studies on DNA methylation profiling in pregnancies complicated with diabetes. A total of 1985 articles were identified, of which 32 met the inclusion criteria and are included in this review. All studies profiled DNA methylation during GDM or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), while no studies investigated T1DM or T2DM. We highlight the increased methylation of two genes,Hypoxia-inducible Factor-3α (HIF3α)andPeroxisome Proliferator-activated Receptor Gamma-coactivator-Alpha (PGC1-α), and the decreased methylation of one gene,Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor Alpha (PPARα), in women with GDM compared to pregnant women with normoglycemia that were consistently methylated across diverse populations with varying pregnancy durations, and using different diagnostic criteria, methodologies and biological sources. These findings support the candidacy of these three differentially methylated genes as biomarkers for GDM. Furthermore, these genes may provide insight into the pathways that are epigenetically influenced during maternal diabetes and which should be prioritized and replicated in longitudinal studies and in larger populations to ensure their clinical applicability. Finally, we discuss the challenges and limitations of DNA methylation analysis, and the need for DNA methylation profiling to be conducted in different types of maternal diabetes in pregnancy.Copyright © 2022 Dias, Willmer, Adam and Pheiffer."
"36980881","Harnessing Genomic Analysis to Explore the Role of Telomeres in the Pathogenesis and Progression of Diabetic Kidney Disease.","Genes (Basel)","The prevalence of diabetes is increasing globally, and this trend is predicted to continue for future decades. Research is needed to uncover new ways to manage diabetes and its co-morbidities. A significant secondary complication of diabetes is kidney disease, which can ultimately result in the need for renal replacement therapy, via dialysis or transplantation. Diabetic kidney disease presents a substantial burden to patients, their families and global healthcare services. This review highlights studies that have harnessed genomic, epigenomic and functional prediction tools to uncover novel genes and pathways associated with DKD that are useful for the identification of therapeutic targets or novel biomarkers for risk stratification. Telomere length regulation is a specific pathway gaining attention recently because of its association with DKD. Researchers are employing both observational and genetics-based studies to identify telomere-related genes associated with kidney function decline in diabetes. Studies have also uncovered novel functions for telomere-related genes beyond the immediate regulation of telomere length, such as transcriptional regulation and inflammation. This review summarises studies that have revealed the potential to harness therapeutics that modulate telomere length, or the associated epigenetic modifications, for the treatment of DKD, to potentially slow renal function decline and reduce the global burden of this disease."

The detection of HPV, EBV, and HCMV in tumor tissue and normal tissue was performed using the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique. A statistically significantly higher risk of endometrial cancer was noted in patients infected only with HCMV (OR > 1;p< 0.05). In contrast, a significantly higher risk of ovarian cancer in group A was associated with HPV16, HPV18, and EBV (OR > 1;p< 0.05); a significantly higher risk of ovarian cancer in group B was associated with HPV18 and HMCV (OR > 1;p< 0.05). The obtained results suggest that HCMV infection is associated with the development of a stage of ovarian cancer when treatment can be completed with surgery alone. Meanwhile, EBV appears to be responsible for the development of ovarian cancer in more advanced stages."

D-ribose is a natural monosaccharide that exists in cells, especially in mitochondria, and can lead to cognitive dysfunction. However, the reason for this is unclear. Berberine (BBR) is an isoquinoline alkaloid that can target mitochondria and has great prospect in the treatment of AD. The methylation of PINK1 reinforces the burden of Alzheimer's pathology. This study explores the role of BBR and D-ribose in the mitophagy and cognitive function of AD related to DNA methylation.APP/PS1mice andN2acells were treated with D-ribose, BBR, and mitophagy inhibitor Mdivi-1 to observe their effects on mitochondrial morphology, mitophagy, neuron histology, AD pathology, animal behavior, and PINK1 methylation. The results showed that D-ribose induced mitochondrial dysfunction, mitophagy damage, and cognitive impairment. However, BBR inhibition of PINK1 promoter methylation can reverse the above effects caused by D-ribose, improve mitochondrial function, and restore mitophagy through the PINK1-Parkin pathway, thus reducing cognitive deficits and the burden of AD pathology. This experiment puts a new light on the mechanism of action of D-ribose in cognitive impairment and reveals new insights in the use of BBR for AD treatment."

In fact, these models have become important pre-clinical testing platforms with proven value and their capacity to be rapidly adapted to interrogate emerging clinical concepts, including the recent discovery of different asthma phenotypes and endotypes, has accelerated the discovery of disease-causing mechanisms and increased our understanding of asthma pathogenesis and the associated effects on lung physiology. In this review, we discuss key distinctions in respiratory physiology between asthma and severe asthma, including the magnitude of airway hyperresponsiveness and recently discovered disease drivers that underpin this phenomenon such as structural changes, airway remodeling, airway smooth muscle hypertrophy, altered airway smooth muscle calcium signaling, and inflammation. We also explore state-of-the-art mouse lung function measurement techniques that accurately recapitulate the human scenario as well as recent advances in precision cut lung slices and cell culture systems. Furthermore, we consider how these techniques have been applied to recently developed mouse models of asthma, severe asthma, and asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap, to examine the effects of clinically relevant exposures (including ovalbumin, house dust mite antigen in the absence or presence of cigarette smoke, cockroach allergen, pollen, and respiratory microbes) and to increase our understanding of lung physiology in these diseases and identify new therapeutic targets. Lastly, we focus on recent studies that examine the effects of diet on asthma outcomes, including high fat diet and asthma, low iron diet during pregnancy and predisposition to asthma development in offspring, and environmental exposures on asthma outcomes. We conclude our review with a discussion of new clinical concepts in asthma and severe asthma that warrant investigation and how we could utilize mouse models and advanced lung physiology measurement systems to identify factors and mechanisms with potential for therapeutic targeting.Copyright © 2023 Carroll, Pillar, Brown, Feng, Chen and Donovan."

Oxidative stress is capable of inducing epigenetic modifications. The transcription factor NRF2 (nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2) is a master regulator of cellular homeostasis, regulating genes bearing antioxidant response elements (AREs) in their promoters. Here, we report the identification of ARE sequences in the promoter regions of genes encoding several epigenetic regulatory factors, such as histone deacetylases (HDACs), DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), and proteins involved in microRNA biogenesis. In this research, we study this possibility by integrating bioinformatic, genetic, pharmacological, and molecular approaches. We found ARE sequences in the promoter regions of genes encoding several HDACs, DNMTs, and proteins involved in miRNA biogenesis. We confirmed that NRF2 regulates the production of these genes by studying NRF2-deficient cells and cells treated with dimethyl fumarate (DMF), an inducer of the NRF2 signaling pathway. In addition, we found that NRF2 could be involved in the target RNA-dependent microRNA degradation (TDMD) of miR-155-5p through its interaction withNfe2l2mRNA. Our data indicate that NRF2 has an epigenetic regulatory function, complementing its traditional function and expanding the regulatory dimensions that should be considered when developing NRF2-centered therapeutic strategies."
"36981620","Inherited Epigenetic Hallmarks of Childhood Obesity Derived from Prenatal Exposure to Obesogens.","Int J Environ Res Public Health","Childhood obesity has reached epidemic levels in developed countries and is becoming a major cause for concern in the developing world. The causes of childhood obesity are complex and multifactorial, involving the interaction between individual genetics and environmental and developmental factors. Among the environmental factors, there is a growing interest in understanding the possible relationship between the so-called environmental obesogens and the development of obesity in children. Exposure to these obesogens such as phthalates, bisphenol A, or parabens, has been identified as a promoter of obesity through different mechanisms such as the alteration of adipocyte development from mesenchymal progenitors, the interference with hormone receptors, and induced inflammation. However, less attention has been paid to the inheritance of epigenetic modifications due to maternal exposure to these compounds during pregnancy. Thus, the aim of this review is to summarize the current knowledge of epigenetic modifications due to maternal exposure to those obesogens during pregnancy as well as their potential implication on long-term obesity development in the offspring and transgenerational inheritance of epiphenotypes."

"36982935","Hematopoietic Stem Cells and the Immune System in Development and Aging.","Int J Mol Sci","Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) support haematopoiesis throughout life and give rise to the whole variety of cells of the immune system. Developing in the early embryo, passing through the precursor stage, and maturing into the first HSCs, they undergo a fairly large number of divisions while maintaining a high regenerative potential due to high repair activity. This potential is greatly reduced in adult HSCs. They go into a state of dormancy and anaerobic metabolism to maintain their stemness throughout life. However, with age, changes occur in the pool of HSCs that negatively affect haematopoiesis and the effectiveness of immunity. Niche aging and accumulation of mutations with age reduces the ability of HSCs to self-renew and changes their differentiation potential. This is accompanied by a decrease in clonal diversity and a disturbance of lymphopoiesis (decrease in the formation of naive T- and B-cells) and the predominance of myeloid haematopoiesis. Aging also affects mature cells, regardless of HSC, therefore, phagocytic activity and the intensity of the oxidative burst decrease, and the efficiency of processing and presentation of antigens by myeloid cells is impaired. Aging cells of innate and adaptive immunity produce factors that form a chronic inflammatory background. All these processes have a serious negative impact on the protective properties of the immune system, increasing inflammation, the risk of developing autoimmune, oncological, and cardiovascular diseases with age. Understanding the mechanisms of reducing the regenerative potential in a comparative analysis of embryonic and aging HSCs, the features of inflammatory aging will allow us to get closer to deciphering the programs for the development, aging, regeneration and rejuvenation of HSCs and the immune system."

We have previously reported that methylglyoxal (MG), a very reactive by-product of glycolysis, unexpectedly enhanced the metastatic potential in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. MG and MG-derived glycation products have been associated with various diseases, such as diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders, and cancer. Glyoxalase 1 (GLO1) exerts an anti-glycation defense by detoxifying MG to D-lactate.Here, we used our validated model consisting of stable GLO1 depletion to induce MG stress in TNBC cells. Using genome-scale DNA methylation analysis, we report that this condition resulted in DNA hypermethylation in TNBC cells and xenografts.GLO1-depleted breast cancer cells showed elevated expression of DNMT3B methyltransferase and significant loss of metastasis-related tumor suppressor genes, as assessed using integrated analysis of methylome and transcriptome data. Interestingly, MG scavengers revealed to be as potent as typical DNA demethylating agents at triggering the re-expression of representative silenced genes. Importantly, we delineated an epigenomic MG signature that effectively stratified TNBC patients based on survival.This study emphasizes the importance of MG oncometabolite, occurring downstream of the Warburg effect, as a novel epigenetic regulator and proposes MG scavengers to reverse altered patterns of gene expression in TNBC.© 2023.

Our cities are built by and for humans, but are also complex, adaptive biological systems involving a diversity of other living species. The majority of these species are invisible and constitute the city's microbiome. Our design decisions for the built environment shape these invisible populations, and as inhabitants we interact with them on a constant basis. A growing body of evidence shows us that human health and well-being are dependent on these interactions. Indeed, multicellular organisms owe meaningful aspects of their development and phenotype to interactions with the microorganisms-bacteria or fungi-with which they live in continual exchange and symbiosis. Therefore, it is meaningful to establish microbial maps of the cities we inhabit. While the processing and sequencing of environmental microbiome samples can be high-throughput, gathering samples is still labor and time intensive, and can require mobilizing large numbers of volunteers to get a snapshot of the microbial landscape of a city.Here we postulate that honeybees may be effective collaborators in gathering samples of urban microbiota, as they forage daily within a 2-mile radius of their hive. We describe the results of a pilot study conducted with three rooftop beehives in Brooklyn, NY, where we evaluated the potential of various hive materials (honey, debris, hive swabs, bee bodies) to reveal information as to the surrounding metagenomic landscape, and where we conclude that the bee debris are the richest substrate. Based on these results, we profiled 4 additional cities through collected hive debris: Sydney, Melbourne, Venice and Tokyo. We show that each city displays a unique metagenomic profile as seen by honeybees. These profiles yield information relevant to hive health such as known bee symbionts and pathogens. Additionally, we show that this method can be used for human pathogen surveillance, with a proof-of-concept example in which we recover the majority of virulence factor genes for Rickettsia felis, a pathogen known to be responsible for ""cat scratch fever"".We show that this method yields information relevant to hive health and human health, providing a strategy to monitor environmental microbiomes on a city scale. Here we present the results of this study, and discuss them in terms of architectural implications, as well as the potential of this method for epidemic surveillance.© 2023. The Author(s)."

These variables, plus others, led to complex organisms that evolved under a defined set of conditions and define how humans will respond to space flight, a circumstance that could not have been anticipated by evolution. Over the past ~60 years, space flight and living in low Earth orbit (LEO) have revealed that astronauts are impacted to varying degrees by such new environments. In addition, it has been noted that astronauts are quite heterogeneous in their response patterns, indicating that such variation is either silent if one remained on Earth, or the heterogeneity unknowingly contributes to disease development during aging or in response to insults. With the planned mission to deep space, humans will now be exposed to further risks from radiation when traveling beyond the influence of the GMF, as well as other potential risks that are associated with the actual loss of the GMF on the astronauts, their microbiomes, and growing food sources. Experimental studies with model systems have revealed that hypogravity conditions can influence a variety biological and physiological systems, and thus the loss of the GMF may have unanticipated consequences to astronauts' systems, such as those that are electrical in nature (i.e., the cardiovascular system and central neural systems). As astronauts have been shown to be heterogeneous in their responses to LEO, they may require personalized countermeasures, while others may not be good candidates for deep-space missions if effective countermeasures cannot be developed for long-duration missions. This review will discuss several of the physiological and neural systems that are affected and how the emerging variables may influence astronaut health and functioning."

Probiotics help tackle these health issues caused during spaceflight by inhibiting pathogen adherence, enhancing epithelial barrier function by reducing permeability, and producing an anti-inflammatory effect. When exposed to microgravity, probiotics demonstrated a shorter lag phase, faster growth, improved acid tolerance, and bile resistance. A freeze-driedLactobacillus caseistrain Shirota capsule was tested for its stability on ISS for a month and has been shown to enhance innate immunity and balance intestinal microbiota. The usage of freeze-dried spores ofB. subtilisproves to be advantageous to long-term spaceflight because it qualifies for all the aspects tested for commercial probiotics under simulated conditions. These results demonstrate a need to further study the effect of probiotics in simulated microgravity and spaceflight conditions and to apply them to overcome the effects caused by gut microbiome dysbiosis and issues that might occur during spaceflight."

The human microbiome involves a whole list of micro-organisms that reside in and on the human host, and plays an integral role in keeping the human host healthy. However, imbalances in the microbiome have been directly linked to many human diseases. Research findings have clearly shown that the outer space environment can directly affect the normal microbiome of astronauts when the astronaut is exposed to the microgravity environment. In this study, we show that the simulation of microgravity on earth can mimic the outer space microgravity environment.Staphylococus aureus(S. aureus) was chosen for this study as it is an opportunistic pathogen, which is part of the normal human skin microflora and the nasal passages. This study's results show thatS. aureusproliferation was significantly increased under a microgravity environment compared to Earth's gravity conditions, which complements previous work performed on bacteria in the outer space environment in the International Space Station (ISS). This demonstrates that this technology can be utilised here on Earth to mimic the outer space environment and to study challenging health-related questions. This in return saves us the cost on conducting experiments in the ISS and can help advance knowledge at a faster rate and produce countermeasures to mitigate the negative side effects of the hostile outer space environment on humans."

The possible functional alterations of the central nervous system (CNS) under GCR exposure can be critical for mission success. Despite the obvious negative effects of ionizing radiation, a number of neutral or even positive effects of GCR irradiation on CNS functions were revealed in ground-based experiments with rodents and primates. This review is focused on the GCR exposure effects on emotional state and cognition, emphasizing positive effects and their potential mechanisms. We integrate these data with GCR effects on adult neurogenesis and pathological protein aggregation, forming a complete picture. We conclude that GCR exposure causes multidirectional effects on cognition, which may be associated with emotional state alterations. However, the irradiation in space-related doses either has no effect or has performance enhancing effects in solving high-level cognition tasks and tasks with a high level of motivation. We suppose the model of neurotransmission changes after irradiation, although the molecular mechanisms of this phenomenon are not fully understood."

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a painless non-invasive brain stimulation technique that could support space exploration in multiple ways. However, changes in brain morphology previously observed after long-term space missions may impact the efficacy of this intervention. We investigated how to optimize TMS for spaceflight-associated brain changes. Magnetic resonance imaging T1-weighted scans were collected from 15 Roscosmos cosmonauts and 14 non-flyer participants before, after 6 months on the International Space Station, and at a 7-month follow-up. Using biophysical modeling, we show that TMS generates different modeled responses in specific brain regions after spaceflight in cosmonauts compared to the control group. Differences are related to spaceflight-induced structural brain changes, such as those impacting cerebrospinal fluid volume and distribution. We suggest solutions to individualize TMS to enhance its efficacy and precision for potential applications in long-duration space missions.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36979747","Training vs. Tolerance: The Yin/Yang of the Innate Immune System.","Biomedicines","For almost nearly a century, memory functions have been attributed only to acquired immune cells. Lately, this paradigm has been challenged by an increasing number of studies revealing that innate immune cells are capable of exhibiting memory-like features resulting in increased responsiveness to subsequent challenges, a process known as trained immunity (known also as innate memory). In contrast, the refractory state of endotoxin tolerance has been defined as an immunosuppressive state of myeloid cells portrayed by a significant reduction in the inflammatory capacity. Both training as well tolerance as adaptive features are reported to be accompanied by epigenetic and metabolic alterations occurring in cells. While training conveys proper protection against secondary infections, the induction of endotoxin tolerance promotes repairing mechanisms in the cells. Consequently, the inappropriate induction of these adaptive cues may trigger maladaptive effects, promoting an increased susceptibility to secondary infections-tolerance, or contribute to the progression of the inflammatory disorder-trained immunity. This review aims at the discussion of these opposing manners of innate immune and non-immune cells, describing the molecular, metabolic and epigenetic mechanisms involved and interpreting the clinical implications in various inflammatory pathologies."

Distant metastasis often occurs in advanced PRAD and most patients are dying from it. However, the mechanism of PRAD progression and metastasis is still unclear. It's widely reported that more than 94% of genes are selectively splicing in humans and many isoforms are particularly related with cancer progression and metastasis. Spliceosome mutations occur in a mutually exclusive manner in breast cancer, and different components of spliceosomes are targets of somatic mutations in different types of breast cancer. Existing evidence strongly supports the key role of alternative splicing in breast cancer biology, and innovative tools are being developed to use splicing events for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. In order to identify if the PRAD metastasis is associated with alternative splicing events (ASEs), the RNA sequencing data and ASEs data of 500 PRAD patients were retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and TCGASpliceSeq databases. By Lasso regression, five genes were screened to construct the prediction model, with a good reliability by ROC curve. Additionally, results in both univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis confirmed the well prognosis efficacy of the prediction model (both P < 0.001). Moreover, a potential splicing regulatory network was established and after multiple-database validation, we supposed that the signaling axis of HSPB1 up-regulating the PIP5K1C - 46,721 - AT (P < 0.001) might mediate the tumorigenesis, progression and metastasis of PRAD via the key members of Alzheimer's disease pathway (SRC, EGFR, MAPT, APP and PRKCA) (P < 0.001).© 2023.

Immune cells play an important role in the progression of HCC. The metabolism of sphingolipids functions in both tumor growth and immune infiltration. However, little research has focused on using sphingolipid factors to predict HCC prognosis. This study aimed to identify the key sphingolipids genes (SPGs) in HCC and develop a reliable prognostic model based on these genes.The TCGA, GEO, and ICGC datasets were grouped using SPGs obtained from the InnateDB portal. A prognostic gene signature was created by applying LASSO-Cox analysis and evaluating it with Cox regression. The validity of the signature was verified using ICGC and GEO datasets. The tumor microenvironment (TME) was examined using ESTIMATE and CIBERSORT, and potential therapeutic targets were identified through machine learning. Single-cell sequencing was used to examine the distribution of signature genes in cells within the TME. Cell viability and migration were tested to confirm the role of the key SPGs.We identified 28 SPGs that have an impact on survival. Using clinicopathological features and 6 genes, we developed a nomogram for HCC. The high- and low-risk groups were found to have distinct immune characteristics and response to drugs. Unlike CD8 T cells, M0 and M2 macrophages were found to be highly infiltrated in the TME of the high-risk subgroup. High levels of SPGs were found to be a good indicator of response to immunotherapy. In cell function experiments, SMPD2 and CSTA were found to enhance survival and migration of Huh7 cells, while silencing these genes increased the sensitivity of Huh7 cells to lapatinib.The study presents a six-gene signature and a nomogram that can aid clinicians in choosing personalized treatments for HCC patients. Furthermore, it uncovers the connection between sphingolipid-related genes and the immune microenvironment, offering a novel approach for immunotherapy. By focusing on crucial sphingolipid genes like SMPD2 and CSTA, the efficacy of anti-tumor therapy can be increased in HCC cells.Copyright © 2023 Zhang, Zhuge, Liu, Xia, Wang, Gao, Jiang, Qu, Fan, Ma, Tan, Luo and Luo."
"37006282","Pan-Cancer analysis and experimental validation identify the oncogenic nature of ESPL1: Potential therapeutic target in colorectal cancer.","Front Immunol","Extra spindle pole bodies like 1 (ESPL1) are required to continue the cell cycle, and its primary role is to initiate the final segregation of sister chromatids. Although prior research has revealed a link between ESPL1 and the development of cancer, no systematic pan-cancer analysis has been conducted. Combining multi-omics data with bioinformatics, we have thoroughly described the function of ESPL1 in cancer. In addition, we examined the impact of ESPL1 on the proliferation of numerous cancer cell lines. In addition, the connection between ESPL1 and medication sensitivity was verified using organoids obtained from colorectal cancer patients. All these results confirm the oncogene nature of ESPL1.Herein, we downloaded raw data from numerous publicly available databases and then applied R software and online tools to explore the association of ESPL1 expression with prognosis, survival, tumor microenvironment, tumor heterogeneity, and mutational profiles. To validate the oncogene nature of ESPL1, we have performed a knockdown of the target gene in various cancer cell lines to verify the effect of ESPL1 on proliferation and migration. In addition, patients' derived organoids were used to verify drug sensitivity.The study found that ESPL1 expression was markedly upregulated in tumorous tissues compared to normal tissues, and high expression of ESPL1 was significantly associated with poor prognosis in a range of cancers. Furthermore, the study revealed that tumors with high ESPL1 expression tended to be more heterogeneous based on various tumor heterogeneity indicators. Enrichment analysis showed that ESPL1 is involved in mediating multiple cancer-related pathways. Notably, the study found that interference with ESPL1 expression significantly inhibited the proliferation of tumor cells. Additionally, the higher the expression of ESPL1 in organoids, the greater the sensitivity to PHA-793887, PAC-1, and AZD7762.Taken together, our study provides evidence that ESPL1 may implicate tumorigenesis and disease progression across multiple cancer types, highlighting its potential utility as both a prognostic indicator and therapeutic target.Copyright © 2023 Zhong, Zheng, Zhang, Wu, Wang, Zhang, Feng and Wang."
"37006250","Integrative analysis revealed that distinct cuprotosis patterns reshaped tumor microenvironment and responses to immunotherapy of colorectal cancer.","Front Immunol","Cuprotosis is a novel form of programmed cell death that involves direct targeting of key enzymes in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle by excess copper and may result in mitochondrial metabolic dysfunction. However, whether cuprotosis may mediate the tumor microenvironment (TME) and immune regulation in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unclear.Ten cuprotosis-related genes were selected and unsupervised consensus clustering was performed to identify the cuprotosis patterns and the correlated TME characteristics. Using principal component analysis, a COPsig score was established to quantify cuprotosis patterns in individual patients. The top 9 most important cuprotosis signature genes were analyzed using single-cell transcriptome data.Three distinct cuprotosis patterns were identified. The TME cell infiltration characteristics of three patterns were associated with immune-excluded, immune-desert, and immune-inflamed phenotype, respectively. Based on individual cuprotosis patterns, patients were assigned into high and low COPsig score groups. Patients with a higher COPsig score were characterized by longer overall survival time, lower immune cell as well as stromal infiltration, and greater tumor mutational burden. Moreover, further analysis demonstrated that CRC patients with a higher COPsig score were more likely to respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors and 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy. Single-cell transcriptome analysis indicated that cuprotosis signature genes recruited tumor-associated macrophages to TME through the regulation of TCA and the metabolism of glutamine and fatty acid, thus influencing the prognosis of CRC patients.This study indicated that distinct cuprotosis patterns laid a solid foundation to the explanation of heterogeneity and complexity of individual TME, thus guiding more effective immunotherapy as well as adjuvant chemotherapy strategies.Copyright © 2023 Xu, Ding, Zhong, Qin, Shu, Yu, Abuduaini, Zhang, Yang and Feng."
"36991019","Histone demethylase KDM2A is a selective vulnerability of cancers relying on alternative telomere maintenance.","Nat Commun","Telomere length maintenance is essential for cellular immortalization and tumorigenesis. 5% - 10% of human cancers rely on a recombination-based mechanism termed alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) to sustain their replicative immortality, yet there are currently no targeted therapies. Through CRISPR/Cas9-based genetic screens in an ALT-immortalized isogenic cellular model, here we identify histone lysine demethylase KDM2A as a molecular vulnerability selectively for cells contingent on ALT-dependent telomere maintenance. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that KDM2A is required for dissolution of the ALT-specific telomere clusters following recombination-directed telomere DNA synthesis. We show that KDM2A promotes de-clustering of ALT multitelomeres through facilitating isopeptidase SENP6-mediated SUMO deconjugation at telomeres. Inactivation of KDM2A or SENP6 impairs post-recombination telomere de-SUMOylation and thus dissolution of ALT telomere clusters, leading to gross chromosome missegregation and mitotic cell death. These findings together establish KDM2A as a selective molecular vulnerability and a promising drug target for ALT-dependent cancers.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Few studies are available regarding the assessment ofLIV1expression in clinical breast cancer (BC) samples.We analyzedLIV1mRNA expression in 8982 primary BC. We searched for correlations betweenLIV1expression and clinicopathological data, including disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), pathological complete response to chemotherapy (pCR), and potential vulnerability and actionability to anti-cancer drugs used or under development in BC. Analyses were performed in the whole population and each molecular subtype separately.LIV1 expression was associated with good-prognosis features and with longer DFS and OS in multivariate analysis. However, patients with highLIV1expression displayed a lower pCR rate than patients with low expression after anthracycline-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy, including in multivariate analysis adjusted on grade and molecular subtypes.LIV1-high tumors were associated with higher probabilities of sensitivity to hormone therapy and CDK4/6 inhibitors and lower probabilities of sensitivity to immune-checkpoint inhibitors and PARP inhibitors. These observations were different according to the molecular subtypes when analyzed separately.These results may provide novel insights into the clinical development and use of LIV1-targeted ADCs by identifying prognostic and predictive value ofLIV1expression in each molecular subtype and associated vulnerability to other systemic therapies."
"36980521","Analysis of Cancer Genomic Amplifications Identifies Druggable Collateral Dependencies within the Amplicon.","Cancers (Basel)","The identification of novel therapeutic targets for specific cancer molecular subtypes is crucial for the development of precision oncology. In the last few years, CRISPR/Cas9 screens have accelerated the discovery and validation of new targets associated with different tumor types, mutations, and fusions. However, there are still many cancer vulnerabilities associated with specific molecular features that remain to be explored. Here, we used data from CRISPR/Cas9 screens in 954 cancer cell lines to identify gene dependencies associated with 16 common cancer genomic amplifications. We found that high-copy-number genomic amplifications generate multiple collateral dependencies within the amplified region in most cases. Further, to prioritize candidate targets for each chromosomal region amplified, we integrated gene dependency parameters with both druggability data and subcellular location. Finally, analysis of the relationship between gene expression and gene dependency led to the identification of genes, the expression of which may constitute predictive biomarkers of dependency. In conclusion, our study provides a set of druggable targets specific for each amplification, opening the possibility to specifically target amplified tumors on this basis."

An important reason is the lack of specific biomarkers to better select susceptible cancer entities and stratify patients. Using a large panel of lung cancer cell lines, we identified a set of ""antioxidant-capacity"" biomarkers (ACB), which were tightly repressed, partly by STAT3 and STAT5A/B in sensitive cells, rendering them susceptible to multiple redox-targeting and ferroptosis-inducing drugs. Contrary to expectation, constitutively low ACB expression was not associated with an increased steady state level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) but a high level of nitric oxide, which is required to sustain high replication rates. Using ACBs, we identified cancer entities with a high percentage of patients with favorable ACB expression pattern, making it likely that more responders to ROS-inducing drugs could be stratified for clinical trials.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

One aspect of PDAC is elevated ATP levels, pointing to the purinergic axis as a potential attractive therapeutic target. Mediated in part by highly druggable extracellular proteins, this axis plays essential roles in fibrosis, inflammation response, and immune function. Analyzing the main members of the PDAC extracellular purinome using publicly available databases discerned which members may impact patient survival.P2RY2presents as the purinergic gene with the strongest association with hypoxia, the highest cancer cell-specific expression, and the strongest impact on overall survival. Invasion assays using a 3D spheroid model revealed P2Y2to be critical in facilitating invasion driven by extracellular ATP. Using genetic modification and pharmacological strategies, we demonstrate mechanistically that this ATP-driven invasion requires direct protein-protein interactions between P2Y2and αV integrins. DNA-PAINT super-resolution fluorescence microscopy reveals that P2Y2regulates the amount and distribution of integrin αV in the plasma membrane. Moreover, receptor-integrin interactions were required for effective downstream signaling, leading to cancer cell invasion. This work elucidates a novel GPCR-integrin interaction in cancer invasion, highlighting its potential for therapeutic targeting.© 2023, Tomas Bort et al."

The miRNA study included samples from five endurance athletes and five power athletes with the predominance of slow-twitch (61.6-72.8%) and fast-twitch (69.3-80.7%) fibers, respectively. Total and small RNA were extracted from tissue samples. Total RNA sequencing (N= 24) revealed 352 differentially expressed genes between the groups with the predominance of fast- and slow-twitch muscle fibers. Small RNA sequencing showed upregulation of miR-206, miR-501-3p and miR-185-5p, and downregulation of miR-499a-5p and miR-208-5p in the group of power athletes with fast-twitch fiber predominance. Two miRtronic miRNAs, miR-208b-3p and miR-499a-5p, had strong correlations in expression with their host genes (MYH7andMYH7B, respectively). Correlations between the expression of miRNAs and their experimentally validated messenger RNA (mRNA) targets were calculated, and 11 miRNA-mRNA interactions with strong negative correlations were identified.

The aim of this study was to investigate GEI effects on dental caries by prioritizing variants from genome-wide vQTL analysis. First, we identified vQTLs from ~4.3 M genome-wide variants in three cohorts of white children aged 3-5 (n = 396, n = 328, n = 773) using Levene's test. A total of 39 independent vQTLs withp< 1 × 10-6were identified, some of which were located in or near genes with plausible biological roles in dental caries (IGFBP7,SLC5A8, andSHHinvolved in tooth development and enamel mineralization). Next, we used linear regression to test GEI effects on dental caries with the 39 prioritized variants and self-reported environmental factors (demographic, socioeconomic, behavioral, and dietary factors) in the three cohorts separately. We identified eight significant GEIs indicating that children with vQTL risk genotypes had higher caries experience if they had less educated parents, lower household/parental income, brushed their teeth less frequently, consumed sugar-sweetened beverages more frequently, were not breastfed, and were female. We reported the first genome-wide vQTL analysis of dental caries in children nominating several novel genes and GEI for further investigations."

Normal wound healing involves hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling. However, the negative factors associated with diabetes, such as bacterial biofilms, persistent inflammation, impaired angiogenesis, inhibited cell proliferation, and pathological scarring, greatly interfere with the smooth progress of the entire healing process. It is this impaired wound healing that leads to diabetic foot ulcers and even amputations. Therefore, drug screening is challenging due to the complexity of damaged healing mechanisms. The establishment of a scientific and reasonable animal experimental model contributes significantly to the in-depth research of diabetic wound pathology, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. In addition to the low cost and transparency of the embryo (for imaging transgene applications), zebrafish have a discrete wound healing process for the separate study of each stage, resulting in their potential as the ideal model animal for diabetic wound healing in the future. In this review, we examine the reasons behind the delayed healing of diabetic wounds, systematically review various studies using zebrafish as a diabetic wound model by different induction methods, as well as summarize the challenges and improvement strategies which provide references for establishing a more reasonable diabetic wound zebrafish model."

It is desired to have a visualization method that can not only be applicable to various application scenarios, including cell clustering and trajectory inference, but also satisfy a variety of technical requirements, especially the ability to preserve inherent structure of data and handle with batch effects. However, no existing methods can accommodate these requirements in a unified framework. In this paper, we propose a general visualization method, deep visualization (DV), that possesses the ability to preserve inherent structure of data and handle batch effects and is applicable to a variety of datasets from different application domains and dataset scales. The method embeds a given dataset into a 2- or 3-dimensional visualization space, with either a Euclidean or hyperbolic metric depending on a specified task type with type static (at a time point) or dynamic (at a sequence of time points) scRNA-seq data, respectively. Specifically, DV learns a structure graph to describe the relationships between data samples, transforms the data into visualization space while preserving the geometric structure of the data and correcting batch effects in an end-to-end manner. The experimental results on nine datasets in complex tissue from human patients or animal development demonstrate the competitiveness of DV in discovering complex cellular relations, uncovering temporal trajectories, and addressing complex batch factors. We also provide a preliminary attempt to pre-train a DV model for visualization of new incoming data.© 2023. The Author(s)."

However, contemporary methods disregard the omics individuality, and the high noise, sparsity, and heterogeneity of single-cell data also impact the fusion effect. Furthermore, available single-cell clustering methods only focus on the cell type clustering, which cannot mine the alternative clustering to comprehensively analyze cells.We propose a single-cell data fusion based multiple clustering (scMCs) approach that can jointly model single-cell transcriptomics and epigenetic data, and explore multiple different clusterings. scMCs first mines the omics-specific and cross-omics consistent representations, then fuses them into a co-embedding representation, which can dissect cellular heterogeneity and impute data. To discover the potential alternative clustering embedded in multi-omics, scMCs projects the co-embedding representation into different salient subspaces. Meanwhile, it reduces the redundancy between subspaces to enhance the diversity of alternative clusterings and optimizes the cluster centers in each subspace to boost the quality of corresponding clustering. Unlike single clustering, these alternative clusterings provide additional perspectives for understanding complex genetic information, such as cell types and states. Experimental results show that scMCs can effectively identify subcellular types, impute dropout events, and uncover diverse cell characteristics by giving different but meaningful clusterings.The code is available at www.sdu-idea.cn/codes.php?name=scMCs.© The Author(s) 2023.

"36997557","ABCB1 expression is increased in human first trimester placenta from pregnant women classified as overweight or obese.","Sci Rep","Obesity has become a global health challenge also affecting reproductive health. In pregnant women, obesity increases the risk of complications such as preterm birth, macrosomia, gestational diabetes, and preeclampsia. Moreover, obesity is associated with long-term adverse effects for the offspring, including increased risk of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases and neurodevelopmental difficulties. The underlying mechanisms are far from understood, but placental function is essential for pregnancy outcome. Transporter proteins P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) are important for trans-placental transport of endogenous substances like lipids and cortisol, a key hormone in tissue maturation. They also hold a protective function protecting the fetus from xenobiotics (e.g. pharmaceuticals). Animal studies suggest that maternal nutritional status can affect expression of placental transporters, but little is known about the effect on the human placenta, especially in early pregnancy. Here, we investigated if overweight and obesity in pregnant women altered mRNA expression of ABCB1 encoding P-gp or ABCG2 encoding BCRP in first trimester human placenta. With informed consent, 75 first trimester placental samples were obtained from women voluntarily seeking surgical abortion (< gestational week 12) (approval no.: 20060063). Villous samples (average gestational age 9.35 weeks) were used for qPCR analysis. For a subset (n = 38), additional villi were snap-frozen for protein analysis. Maternal BMI was defined at the time of termination of pregnancy. Compared to women with BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m2(n = 34), ABCB1 mRNA expression was significantly increased in placenta samples from women classified as overweight (BMI 25-29.9 kg/m2, n = 18) (p = 0.040) and women classified as obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2, n = 23) (p = 0.003). Albeit P-gp expression did not show statistically significant difference between groups, the effect of increasing BMI was the same in male and female pregnancies. To investigate if the P-gp increase was compensated, we determined the expression of ABCG2 which was unaffected by maternal obesity (p = 0.291). Maternal BMI affects ABCB1 but not ABCG2 mRNA expression in first trimester human placenta. Further studies of early placental function are needed to understand how the expression of placental transport proteins is regulated by maternal factors such as nutritional status and determine the potential consequences for placental-fetal interaction.© 2023.

Six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of prostate 3 (STEAP3) is a ferrireductase involved in the regulation of intracellular iron homeostasis. However, the clinical significance and biological function of STEAP3 in human cancers remain poorly understood. Through a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis, we found that STEAP3 mRNA and protein expression were up-regulated in GBM, LUAD, and UCEC, and down-regulated in LIHC. Survival analysis indicated that STEAP3 had prognostic significance only in glioma. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that high STEPA3 expression was correlated with poor prognosis. STEAP3 expression was significantly negatively correlated with promoter methylation level, and patients with lower STEAP3 methylation level had worse prognosis than those with higher STEAP3 methylation level. Single-cell functional state atlas showed that STEAP3 regulated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in GBM. Furthermore, the results of wound healing and transwell invasion assays demonstrated that knocking down STEAP3 inhibited the migration and invasion of T98G and U251 cells. Functional enrichment analysis suggested that genes co-expressed with STEAP3 mainly participated in inflammation and immune-related pathways. Immunological analysis revealed that STEAP3 expression was significantly correlated with immune infiltration cells, including macrophages and neutrophils, especially the M2 macrophages. Individuals with low STEAP3 expression were more likely to respond to immunotherapy than those with high STEAP3 expression. These results suggest that STEAP3 promotes glioma progression and highlight its pivotal role in regulating immune microenvironment.© 2023 Deng et al."

Identifying novel biomarkers that overcome these limitations could facilitate early diagnosis and therapy. This study aimed to compare the concentrations of synovial fluid (SF) and plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) over time in control horses with those with induced carpal OA. Following an established model, unilateral carpal OA was induced in 9 of 17 healthy Thoroughbred fillies, while the remainder were sham-operated controls. Synovial fluid and plasma samples were obtained before induction of OA (Day 0) and weekly thereafter until Day 63, and cfDNA concentrations were determined using fluorometry. The SF cfDNA concentrations were significantly higher for OA joints than for sham-operated joints on Days 28 (median 1430 μg/L and 631 μg/L, respectively,p= 0.017) and 63 (median 1537 μg/L and 606 μg/L, respectively,p= 0.021). There were no significant differences in plasma cfDNA between the OA and the sham groups after induction of carpal OA. Plasma cfDNA measurement is not sufficiently sensitive for diagnostic purposes in this induced model of OA. Synovial fluid cfDNA measurement may be used as a biomarker to monitor early disease progression in horses with OA."

Patient data including age, sex, height weight, the internal diameter (ID) of the ET, and ET depth were collected from electronic medical records and chest x-ray. Among these, 1436 data were divided into training (70%, n = 1007) and testing (30%, n = 429) datasets. The training dataset was used to build the appropriate ET depth estimation model, while the test dataset was used to compare the model performance with the formula-based methods such as age-based method, height-based method and tube-ID method. The rate of inappropriate ET location was significantly lower in our ML model (17.9%) compared to formula-based methods (35.7%, 62.2%, and 46.6%). The relative risk [95% confidence interval, CI] of an inappropriate ET location compared to ML model in the age-based, height-based, and tube ID-based method were 1.99 [1.56-2.52], 3.47 [2.80-4.30], and 2.60 [2.07-3.26], respectively. In addition, compared to ML model, the relative risk of shallow intubation tended to be higher in the age-based method, whereas the risk of the deep or endobronchial intubation tended to be higher in the height-based and the tube ID-based method. The use of our ML model was able to predict optimal ET depth for pediatric patients only with basic patient information and reduce the risk of inappropriate ET placement. It will be helpful to clinicians unfamiliar with pediatric tracheal intubation to determine the appropriate ET depth.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36991112","Targeted DNA integration in human cells without double-strand breaks using CRISPR-associated transposases.","Nat Biotechnol","Conventional genome engineering with CRISPR-Cas9 creates double-strand breaks (DSBs) that lead to undesirable byproducts and reduce product purity. Here we report an approach for programmable integration of large DNA sequences in human cells that avoids the generation of DSBs by using Type I-F CRISPR-associated transposases (CASTs). We optimized DNA targeting by the QCascade complex through protein design and developed potent transcriptional activators by exploiting the multi-valent recruitment of the AAA+ ATPase TnsC to genomic sites targeted by QCascade. After initial detection of plasmid-based integration, we screened 15 additional CAST systems from a wide range of bacterial hosts, identified a homolog from Pseudoalteromonas that exhibits improved activity and further increased integration efficiencies. Finally, we discovered that bacterial ClpX enhances genomic integration by multiple orders of magnitude, likely by promoting active disassembly of the post-integration CAST complex, akin to its known role in Mu transposition. Our work highlights the ability to reconstitute complex, multi-component machineries in human cells and establishes a strong foundation to exploit CRISPR-associated transposases for eukaryotic genome engineering.© 2023.

"36982514","Benzo(a)pyrene and Cerium Dioxide Nanoparticles in Co-Exposure Impair Human Trophoblast Cell Stress Signaling.","Int J Mol Sci","Human placenta is a multifunctional interface between maternal and fetal blood. Studying the impact of pollutants on this organ is crucial because many xenobiotics in maternal blood can accumulate in placental cells or pass into the fetal circulation. Benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) and cerium dioxide nanoparticles (CeO2NP), which share the same emission sources, are found in ambient air pollution and also in maternal blood. The aim of the study was to depict the main signaling pathways modulated after exposure to BaP or CeO2NP vs. co-exposure on both chorionic villi explants and villous cytotrophoblasts isolated from human term placenta. At nontoxic doses of pollutants, BaP is bioactivated by AhR xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes, leading to DNA damage with an increase in γ-H2AX, the stabilization of stress transcription factor p53, and the induction of its target p21. These effects are reproduced in co-exposure with CeO2NP, except for the increase in γ-H2AX, which suggests a modulation of the genotoxic effect of BaP by CeO2NP. Moreover, CeO2NP in individual and co-exposure lead to a decrease in Prx-SO3, suggesting an antioxidant effect. This study is the first to identify the signaling pathways modulated after co-exposure to these two pollutants, which are common in the environment."

However, large-scale prospective studies examining growth during infancy according to birth order are limited. We aimed to investigate the relationship between birth order and growth during the first 4 years of life in a Japanese prospective birth cohort study. A total of 26,249 full-term singleton births were targeted. General linear and multivariable logistic regression models were performed and adjusted for birth weight, parents' heights, maternal age at delivery, gestational weight gain, maternal smoking and alcohol drinking status during pregnancy, household income, breastfeeding status, and Study Areas. The multivariate adjusted mean length Z-scores in ""first-borns having no sibling"", ""first-borns having siblings"", ""second-borns"", and ""third-borns or more"" were -0.026, -0.013, 0.136, and 0.120 at birth and -0.324, -0.330, -0.466, and -0.569 at 10 months, respectively. Results similar to those at 10 months were observed at 1.5, 3, and 4 years. The adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of short stature at 4 years in ""first-borns having siblings"", ""second-borns"", and ""third-borns or more"" were 1.08 (0.84-1.39), 1.36 (1.13-1.62), and 1.50 (1.20-1.88), respectively, versus ""first-borns having no sibling"". Birth order was significantly associated with postnatal growth and may be a factor predisposing to short stature in early childhood."
"36806146","Regulation of endogenous retrovirus-derived regulatory elements by GATA2/3 and MSX2 in human trophoblast stem cells.","Genome Res","The placenta is an organ with extraordinary phenotypic diversity in eutherian mammals. Recent evidence suggests that numerous human placental enhancers are evolved from lineage-specific insertions of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), yet the transcription factors (TFs) underlying their regulation remain largely elusive. Here, by first focusing on MER41, a primate-specific ERV family previously linked to placenta and innate immunity, we uncover the binding motifs of multiple crucial trophoblast TFs (GATA2/3, MSX2, GRHL2) in addition to innate immunity TFs STAT1 and IRF1. Integration of ChIP-seq data confirms the binding of GATA2/3, MSX2, and their related factors on the majority of MER41-derived enhancers in human trophoblast stem cells (TSCs). MER41-derived enhancers that are constitutively active in human TSCs are distinct from those activated upon interferon stimulation, which is determined by the binding of relevant TFs and their subfamily compositions. We further demonstrate that GATA2/3 and MSX2 have prevalent binding to numerous other ERV families - indicating their broad impact on ERV-derived enhancers. Functionally, the derepression of many syncytiotrophoblast genes after MSX2 knockdown is likely to be mediated by regulatory elements derived from ERVs - suggesting ERVs are also important for mediating transcriptional repression. Overall, this study characterizes the regulation of ERV-derived regulatory elements by GATA2/3, MSX2, and their cofactors in human TSCs, and provides mechanistic insights into the importance of ERVs in human trophoblast regulatory network.© 2023 Du et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press."
"36992779","Hyperglycemia First Detected in Pregnancy in South Africa: Facts, Gaps, and Opportunities.","Front Clin Diabetes Healthc","This review contextualizes hyperglycemia in pregnancy from a South-African perspective. It aims to create awareness of the importance of hyperglycemia in pregnancy in low-middle-income countries. We address unanswered questions to guide future research on sub-Saharan African women with hyperglycemia first detected in pregnancy (HFDP). South African women of childbearing age have the highest prevalence of obesity in sub-Saharan Africa. They are predisposed to Type 2 diabetes (T2DM), the leading cause of death in South African women. T2DM remains undiagnosed in many African countries, with two-thirds of people living with diabetes unaware. With the South African health policy's increased focus on improving antenatal care, women often gain access to screening for non-communicable diseases for the first time in pregnancy. While screening practices and diagnostic criteria for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) differ amongst geographical areas in South Africa (SA), hyperglycemia of varying degrees is often first detected in pregnancy. This is often erroneously ascribed to GDM, irrespective of the degree of hyperglycemia and not overt diabetes. T2DM and GDM convey a graded increased risk for the mother and fetus during and after pregnancy, with cardiometabolic risk accumulating across the lifespan. Resource limitations and high patient burden have hampered the opportunity to implement accessible preventative care in young women at increased risk of developing T2DM in the broader public health system in SA. All women with HFDP, including those with true GDM, should be followed and undergo glucose assessment postpartum. In SA, studies conducted early postpartum have noted persistent hyperglycemia in a third of women after GDM. Interpregnancy care is advantageous and may attain a favourable metabolic legacy in these young women, but the yield of return following delivery is suboptimal. We review the current best evidence regarding HFDP and contextualize the applicability in SA and other African or low-middle-income countries. The review identifies gaps and shares pragmatic solutions regarding clinical factors that may improve awareness, identification, diagnosis, and management of women with HFDP.Copyright © 2022 Coetzee, Hall and Conradie."
"36947895","Adolescent neurodevelopment and psychopathology: The interplay between adversity exposure and genetic risk for accelerated brain ageing.","Dev Cogn Neurosci","In adulthood, stress exposure and genetic risk heighten psychological vulnerability by accelerating neurobiological senescence. To investigate whether molecular and brain network maturation processes play a similar role in adolescence, we analysed genetic, as well as longitudinal task neuroimaging (inhibitory control, incentive processing) and early life adversity (i.e., material deprivation, violence) data from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development study (N = 980, age range: 9-13 years). Genetic risk was estimated separately for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD), two pathologies linked to stress exposure and allegedly sharing a causal connection (MDD-to-AD). Adversity and genetic risk for MDD/AD jointly predicted functional network segregation patterns suggestive of accelerated (GABA-linked) visual/attentional, but delayed (dopamine [D2]/glutamate [GLU5R]-linked) somatomotor/association system development. A positive relationship between brain maturation and psychopathology emerged only among the less vulnerable adolescents, thereby implying that normatively maladaptive neurodevelopmental alterations could foster adjustment among the more exposed and genetically more stress susceptible youths. Transcriptomic analyses suggested that sensitivity to stress may underpin the joint neurodevelopmental effect of adversity and genetic risk for MDD/AD, in line with the proposed role of negative emotionality as a precursor to AD, likely to account for the alleged causal impact of MDD on dementia onset.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

Characterizing associations between diagnosed mental and physical health problems, prior pharmacological treatments, and aggregate genetic factors has potential to inform risk stratification and mitigation strategies.In this study of 3,942 SCZ and 5,414 BPI patients receiving VA care, self-reported SB and ideation were assessed using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). These cross-sectional data were integrated with electronic health records (EHR), and compared by lifetime diagnoses, treatment histories, follow-up screenings, and mortality data. Polygenic scores (PGS) for traits related to psychiatric disorders, substance use, and cognition were constructed using available genomic data, and exploratory genome-wide association studies were performed to identify and prioritize specific loci.Only 20% of veterans who self-reported SB had a corroborating ICD-9/10 code in their EHR; and among those who denied prior behaviors, more than 20% reported new-onset SB at follow-up. SB were associated with a range of psychiatric and non-psychiatric diagnoses, and with treatment with specific classes of psychotropic medications (e.g., antidepressants, antipsychotics, etc.). PGS for externalizing behaviors, smoking, suicide attempt, and major depressive disorder were also associated with attempt and ideation.Among individuals with a diagnosed mental illness, a GWAS for SB did not yield any significant loci. Self-reported SB were strongly associated with clinical variables across several EHR domains. Overall, clinical and polygenic analyses point to sequelae of substance-use related behaviors and other psychiatric comorbidities as strong correlates of prior and subsequent SB. Nonetheless, past SB was frequently not documented in clinical settings, underscoring the value of regular screening based on direct, in-person assessments, especially among high-risk individuals."

Along this line, intense studies with immense amounts of biological information have boosted the discovery of molecular biomarkers. Cancer is one of the leading causes of death around the world in recent years. Elucidation of genomic and epigenetic factors in Breast Cancer (BRCA) can provide a roadmap to uncover the disease mechanisms. Accordingly, unraveling the possible systematic connections between-omics data types and their contribution to BRCA tumor progression is crucial. In this study, we have developed a novel machine learning (ML) based integrative approach for multi-omics data analysis. This integrative approach combines information from gene expression (mRNA), microRNA (miRNA) and methylation data. Due to the complexity of cancer, this integrated data is expected to improve the prediction, diagnosis and treatment of disease through patterns only available from the 3-way interactions between these 3-omics datasets. In addition, the proposed method bridges the interpretation gap between the disease mechanisms that drive onset and progression. Our fundamental contribution is the 3 Multi-omics integrative tool (3Mint). This tool aims to perform grouping and scoring of groups using biological knowledge. Another major goal is improved gene selectionviadetection of novel groups of cross-omics biomarkers. Performance of 3Mint is assessed using different metrics. Our computational performance evaluations showed that the 3Mint classifies the BRCA molecular subtypes with lower number of genes when compared to the miRcorrNet tool which uses miRNA and mRNA gene expression profiles in terms of similar performance metrics (95% Accuracy). The incorporation of methylation data in 3Mint yields a much more focused analysis.

"36999049","RNA-seq data science: From raw data to effective interpretation.","Front Genet","RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has become an exemplary technology in modern biology and clinical science. Its immense popularity is due in large part to the continuous efforts of the bioinformatics community to develop accurate and scalable computational tools to analyze the enormous amounts of transcriptomic data that it produces. RNA-seq analysis enables genes and their correspondingtranscriptsto be probed for a variety of purposes, such as detecting novel exons or whole transcripts, assessing expression of genes and alternative transcripts, and studying alternative splicing structure. It can be a challenge, however, to obtain meaningful biological signals from raw RNA-seq data because of the enormous scale of the data as well as the inherent limitations of different sequencing technologies, such asamplification biasorbiases of library preparation. The need to overcome these technical challenges has pushed the rapid development of novel computational tools, which have evolved and diversified in accordance with technological advancements, leading to the current myriad of RNA-seq tools. These tools, combined with the diverse computational skill sets of biomedical researchers, help to unlock the full potential of RNA-seq.

"36980209","Pathogenic Microglia Orchestrate Neurotoxic Properties of Eomes-Expressing Helper T Cells.","Cells","In addition to disease-associated microglia (DAM), microglia with MHC-II and/or IFN-I signatures may form additional pathogenic subsets that are relevant to neurodegeneration. However, the significance of such MHC-II and IFN-I signatures remains elusive. We demonstrate here that these microglial subsets play intrinsic roles in orchestrating neurotoxic properties of neurotoxic Eomes+Th cells under the neurodegeneration-associated phase of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) that corresponds to progressive multiple sclerosis (MS). Microglia acquire IFN-signature after sensing ectopically expressed long interspersed nuclear element-1 (L1) gene. Furthermore, ORF1, an L1-encoded protein aberrantly expressed in the diseased central nervous system (CNS), stimulated Eomes+Th cells after Trem2-dependent ingestion and presentation in MHC-II context by microglia. Interestingly, administration of an L1 inhibitor significantly ameliorated neurodegenerative symptoms of EAE concomitant with reduced accumulation of Eomes+Th cells in the CNS. Collectively, our data highlight a critical contribution of new microglia subsets as a neuroinflammatory hub in immune-mediated neurodegeneration."
"36978553","Chicken Hypothalamic and Ovarian DNA Methylome Alteration in Response to Forced Molting.","Animals (Basel)","Epigenetic modifications play an important role in regulating animal adaptation to external stress. To explore how DNA methylation regulates the expression levels of related genes during forced molting (FM) of laying hens, the hypothalamus and ovary tissues were analyzed at five periods using Whole-Genome Bisulfite Sequencing. The results show that methylation levels fluctuated differently in the exon, intron, 5'UTR, 3'UTR, promoter, and intergenic regions of the genome during FM. In addition, 16 differentially methylated genes (DMGs) regulating cell aging, immunity, and development were identified in the two reversible processes of starvation and redevelopment during FM. Comparing DMGs with differentially expressed genes (DEGs) obtained in the same periods, five hypermethylated DMGs (DSTYK, NKTR, SMOC1, SCAMP3, and ATOH8) that inhibited the expression of DEGs were found. Therefore, DMGs epigenetically modify the DEGs during the FM process of chickens, leading to the rapid closure and restart of their reproductive function and a re-increase in the egg-laying rate. Therefore, this study further confirmed that epigenetic modifications could regulate gene expression during FM and provides theoretical support for the subsequent optimization of FM technology."
"37004608","Risk Factors for Postpartum Depression Based on Genetic and Epigenetic Interactions.","Mol Neurobiol","Postpartum depression (PPD) is a serious mood disorder that tends to occur after the delivery, which may bring lifelong consequences to women and their families in terms of family relationships, social relationships, and mental health. Currently, various risk factors including environmental factors and genetic factors that may induce postpartum depression have been extensively studied. In this review, we suggest that postpartum women's susceptibility to postpartum depression may be the result of the interaction between the genes associated with postpartum depression as well as the interaction between genetic and environmental factors. We reviewed the genes that have been studied in postpartum depression, including genes related to the synthesis, metabolism, and transport of monoamine neurotransmitters, key molecules of the HPA axis, and the kynurenine pathway. These studies have found more or less gene-gene and gene-environment interactions, so we will discuss these issues in more detail. However, so far, the conclusions of these risk factors, especially genetic factors, are not completely consistent in the occurrence and exacerbation of symptoms in postpartum depression, and it is not clear how these risk factors specifically participate in the pathological mechanism of the disease and play a role. We conclude that the role of genetic polymorphisms, including genetic and epigenetic processes, in the occurrence and development of postpartum depression, is complex and ambiguous. We also note that interactions between multiple candidate genes and the environment have been suggested as causes of depression, suggesting that more definitive research is needed to understand the heritability and susceptibility of PPD. Overall, our work supports the hypothesis that postpartum depression is more likely to be caused by a combination of multiple genetic and environmental factors than by a single genetic or environmental influence.© 2023.

In order to integrate age prediction into routine forensic workflow, the purpose of this study was to standardize and optimize a DNA methylation-based protocol tailored to the Italian context. A previously published protocol and age-predictive method was implemented for the analysis of 84 blood samples originating from Central Italy. The study here presented is based on the Single Base Extension method, considering five genes: ELOVL2, FHL2, KLF14, C1orf132, now identified as MIR29B2C, and TRIM59. The precise and specific steps consist of DNA extraction and quantification, bisulfite conversion, amplification of converted DNA, first purification, single base extension, second purification, capillary electrophoresis, and analysis of the results to train and test the tool. The prediction error obtained, expressed as mean absolute deviation, showed a value of 3.12 years in the training set and 3.01 years in the test set. Given that population-based differences in DNA methylation patterns have been previously reported in the literature, it would be useful to further improve the study implementing additional samples representative of the entire Italian population."

Several methods have been proposed to estimate the degree of XCI-S (denoted as γ) for quantitative and qualitative traits based on unrelated females. However, there is no method available for estimating γ based on general pedigrees. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Bayesian method to obtain the point estimate and the credible interval of γ based on the mixture of general pedigrees and unrelated females (called mixed data for brevity), which is also suitable for only general pedigrees. We consider the truncated normal prior and the uniform prior for γ. Further, we apply the eigenvalue decomposition and Cholesky decomposition to our proposed methods to accelerate the computation speed. We conduct extensive simulation studies to compare the performances of our proposed methods and two existing Bayesian methods which are only applicable to unrelated females. The simulation results show that the incorporation of general pedigrees can improve the efficiency of the point estimation and the precision and the accuracy of the interval estimation of γ. Finally, we apply the proposed methods to the Minnesota Center for Twin and Family Research data for their practical use."

This process involves several changes, described as hallmarks of ageing, which include genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic changes, loss of proteostasis, dysregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell depletion, and altered intracellular communication. The determining role that environmental factors such as diet and lifestyle play on health, life expectancy, and susceptibility to diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, is wellestablished. In view of the growing interest in the beneficial effects of phytochemicals in the prevention of chronic diseases, several studies have been conducted, and they strongly suggest that the intake of dietary polyphenols may bring numerous benefits due to their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and their intake has been associated with impaired ageing in humans. Polyphenol intake has been shown to be effective in ameliorating several age-related phenotypes, including oxidative stress, inflammatory processes, impaired proteostasis, and cellular senescence, among other features, which contribute to an increased risk of ageing-associated diseases. This review aims to address, in a general way, the main findings described in the literature about the benefits of polyphenols in each of the hallmarks of ageing, as well as the main regulatory mechanisms responsible for the observed antiageing effects."

The capability of cell reprogramming, such as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) technology, solved the complications associated with human embryonic stem cells (hESC) usage. Moreover, iPSCs made significant contributions for human medicine, such as in diagnosis, therapeutic and regenerative medicine. The two-dimensional (2D) models allowed for monolayer cellular culture in vitro; however, they were surpassed by the three-dimensional (3D) cell culture system. The 3D cell culture provides higher cell-cell contact and a multi-layered cell culture, which more closely respects cellular morphology and polarity. It is more tightly able to resemble conditions in vivo and a closer approach to the architecture of human tissues, such as human organoids. Organoids are 3D cellular structures that mimic the architecture and function of native tissues. They are generated in vitro from stem cells or differentiated cells, such as epithelial or neural cells, and are used to study organ development, disease modeling, and drug discovery.

COVID-19 patients were grouped as asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe, or critically ill according to NIH classifications. Proteomic profiling of 7,288 analytes corresponding to 6,596 unique protein targets was performed using the SOMAmer platform.Herein, we profile the plasma proteome of pregnant and non-pregnant COVID-19 patients and controls and show alterations that display a dose-response relationship with disease severity; yet, such proteomic perturbations are dampened during pregnancy. In both pregnant and non-pregnant state, the proteome response induced by COVID-19 shows enrichment of mediators implicated in cytokine storm, endothelial dysfunction, and angiogenesis. Shared and pregnancy-specific proteomic changes are identified: pregnant women display a tailored response that may protect the conceptus from heightened inflammation, while non-pregnant individuals display a stronger response to repel infection. Furthermore, the plasma proteome can accurately identify COVID-19 patients, even when asymptomatic or with mild symptoms.This study represents the most comprehensive characterization of the plasma proteome of pregnant and non-pregnant COVID-19 patients. Our findings emphasize the distinct immune modulation between the non-pregnant and pregnant states, providing insight into the pathogenesis of COVID-19 as well as a potential explanation for the more severe outcomes observed in pregnant women.© 2023.

Cancer-associated copy number variants and single nucleotide polymorphisms promote rewiring of chromatin loops, disruption of topologically associating domains (TADs), active/inactive chromatin state switching, leading to oncogene expression and silencing of tumor suppressors. However, little is known about 3D changes during cancer progression to a chemotherapy-resistant state. We integrated chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C), RNA-seq, and whole-genome sequencing obtained from triple-negative breast cancer patient-derived xenograft primary tumors (UCD52) and carboplatin-resistant samples and found increased short-range (< 2 Mb) interactions, chromatin looping, formation of TAD, chromatin state switching into a more active state, and amplification of ATP-binding cassette transporters. Transcriptome changes suggested the role of long-noncoding RNAs in carboplatin resistance. Rewiring of the 3D genome was associated with TP53, TP63, BATF, FOS-JUN family of transcription factors and led to activation of aggressiveness-, metastasis- and other cancer-related pathways. Integrative analysis highlighted increased ribosome biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation, suggesting the role of mitochondrial energy metabolism. Our results suggest that 3D genome remodeling may be a key mechanism underlying carboplatin resistance.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Risk factors such as age, sex, genetics, injuries and obesity can concur to the onset of the disease, variably triggering the loss of maturational arrest of chondrocytes further sustained by oxidative stress, inflammation and catabolism. Different types of nutraceuticals have been studied for their anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. Olive-derived polyphenols draw particular interest due to their ability to dampen the activation of pivotal signaling pathways in OA. Our study aims to investigate the effects of oleuropein (OE) and hydroxytyrosol (HT) in in vitro OA models and elucidate their possible effects on NOTCH1, a novel therapeutic target for OA. Chondrocytes were cultured and exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Detailed analysis was carried out about the OE/HT mitigating effects on the release of ROS (DCHF-DA), the increased gene expression of catabolic and inflammatory markers (real time RT-PCR), the release of MMP-13 (ELISA and Western blot) and the activation of underlying signaling pathways (Western blot). Our findings show that HT/OE efficiently attenuates LPS-induced effects by firstly reducing the activation of JNK and of the NOTCH1 pathway downstream. In conclusion, our study provides molecular bases supporting the dietary supplementation of olive-derived polyphenols to revert/delay the progression of OA."

Here, we developed a forward genetic screening platform that combines CRISPR-Cas9 perturbations, cell coculture in picoliter droplets, and microfluidic-based fluorescence-activated droplet sorting to identify mechanisms of cell-cell communication. We used SPEAC-seq (systematic perturbation of encapsulated associated cells followed by sequencing), in combination with in vivo genetic perturbations, to identify microglia-produced amphiregulin as a suppressor of disease-promoting astrocyte responses in multiple sclerosis preclinical models and clinical samples. Thus, SPEAC-seq enables the high-throughput systematic identification of cell-cell communication mechanisms."
"37016065","Effect of age on the risk of immune-related adverse events in patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors.","Clin Exp Med","Identifying patients at increased risk of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) facilitates safe application of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). This retrospective study aimed to determine the effect of age on the risk of irAEs in patients receiving ICIs and to identify potential mechanisms underlying age-related irAE risk differences. We analyzed reports of FDA Adverse Event Reporting System from July 1, 2014, to September 30, 2021. The information component ratio (ICΔ) was used to compare the irAE risk between older adults (> 65 years) and younger adults (25-65 years), of which the 95% confidential interval lower limit (ICΔ025) exceeding zero indicated significantly increased risk. We found that older adults had a significantly higher overall irAE risk than younger adults (ICΔ0250.38), which was observed in almost all organ systems. We further analyzed the correlation between age-related irAE risks and age-related transcriptional changes to identify potential genes and pathways underlying age-related irAE risk differences. We found that genes significantly correlated with ICΔwere enriched in processes including extracellular matrix organization, regulation of myeloid leukocyte mediated immunity, and regulation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) cascade. In addition, single-cell RNA sequencing analysis confirmed that genes involved in collagen-containing extracellular matrix and JNK cascade were significantly upregulated in myeloid cells from ICI-associated colitis tissues compared with ICI-treated colon tissues without colitis. In conclusion, older adults receiving ICIs have higher irAE risks than younger adults. Upregulation of genes involved in JNK cascade and collagen-containing extracellular matrix in myeloid cells may contribute to increased irAE risks in older adults.© 2023.

"37002403","Best practices for single-cell analysis across modalities.","Nat Rev Genet","Recent advances in single-cell technologies have enabled high-throughput molecular profiling of cells across modalities and locations. Single-cell transcriptomics data can now be complemented by chromatin accessibility, surface protein expression, adaptive immune receptor repertoire profiling and spatial information. The increasing availability of single-cell data across modalities has motivated the development of novel computational methods to help analysts derive biological insights. As the field grows, it becomes increasingly difficult to navigate the vast landscape of tools and analysis steps. Here, we summarize independent benchmarking studies of unimodal and multimodal single-cell analysis across modalities to suggest comprehensive best-practice workflows for the most common analysis steps.

"36978989","Single-Cell Kinetic Modeling of β-Lapachone Metabolism in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.","Antioxidants (Basel)","Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells are highly heterogeneous in their metabolism and typically experience elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the tumor microenvironment. Tumor cells survive under these chronic oxidative conditions by upregulating antioxidant systems. To investigate the heterogeneity of cellular responses to chemotherapeutic H2O2generation in tumor and healthy tissue, we leveraged single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to perform redox systems-level simulations of quinone-cycling β-lapachone treatment as a source of NQO1-dependent rapid superoxide and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. Transcriptomic data from 10 HNSCC patient tumors was used to populate over 4000 single-cell antioxidant enzymatic network models of drug metabolism. The simulations reflected significant systems-level differences between the redox states of healthy and cancer cells, demonstrating in some patient samples a targetable cancer cell population or in others statistically indistinguishable effects between non-malignant and malignant cells. Subsequent multivariate analyses between healthy and malignant cellular models pointed to distinct contributors of redox responses between these phenotypes. This model framework provides a mechanistic basis for explaining mixed outcomes of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1)-bioactivatable therapeutics despite the tumor specificity of these drugs as defined by NQO1/catalase expression and highlights the role of alternate antioxidant components in dictating drug-induced oxidative stress."

Insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs) regulate many biological processes; however, the functional contributions of IGFBP2 in lung fibrosis remain largely unclear. Here, we report that intranasal delivery of recombinant IGFBP2 protects aged mice from weight loss and demonstrated antifibrotic effects after bleomycin lung injury. Notably, aged human-Igfbp2 transgenic mice reveal reduced senescence and senescent-associated secretory phenotype factors in alveolar epithelial type 2 (AEC2) cells and they ameliorated bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. Finally, we demonstrate that IGFBP2 expression is significantly suppressed in AEC2 cells isolated from fibrotic lung regions of patients with IPF and/or pulmonary hypertension compared with patients with hypersensitivity pneumonitis and/or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Altogether, our study provides insights into how IGFBP2 regulates AEC2-cell-specific senescence and that restoring IGFBP2 levels in fibrotic lungs can prove effective for patients with IPF.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

"36980246","A Systematic Review of Progress toward Unlocking the Power of Epigenetics in NSCLC: Latest Updates and Perspectives.","Cells","Epigenetic research has the potential to improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of cancer, specifically non-small-cell lung cancer, and support our efforts to personalize the management of the disease. Epigenetic alterations are expected to have relevance for early detection, diagnosis, outcome prediction, and tumor response to therapy. Additionally, epi-drugs as therapeutic modalities may lead to the recovery of genes delaying tumor growth, thus increasing survival rates, and may be effective against tumors without druggable mutations. Epigenetic changes involve DNA methylation, histone modifications, and the activity of non-coding RNAs, causing gene expression changes and their mutual interactions. This systematic review, based on 110 studies, gives a comprehensive overview of new perspectives on diagnostic (28 studies) and prognostic (25 studies) epigenetic biomarkers, as well as epigenetic treatment options (57 studies) for non-small-cell lung cancer. This paper outlines the crosstalk between epigenetic and genetic factors as well as elucidates clinical contexts including epigenetic treatments, such as dietary supplements and food additives, which serve as anti-carcinogenic compounds and regulators of cellular epigenetics and which are used to reduce toxicity. Furthermore, a future-oriented exploration of epigenetic studies in NSCLC is presented. The findings suggest that additional studies are necessary to comprehend the mechanisms of epigenetic changes and investigate biomarkers, response rates, and tailored combinations of treatments. In the future, epigenetics could have the potential to become an integral part of diagnostics, prognostics, and personalized treatment in NSCLC."

In many countries, MAFLD has become the most common cause of chronic liver disease. On the contrary, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) mortality is rising. Liver tumors have become the third cause of cancer mortality worldwide. HCC is the most frequent liver tumor. While the burden of HCC related to viral hepatitis is declining, the prevalence of MAFLD-related HCC is rising rapidly. Classical screening criteria for HCC consider cirrhotic, advanced fibrosis, and viral hepatitis patients. Metabolic syndrome with liver involvement or MAFLD is associated with a higher risk of HCC development, even in the absence of cirrhosis. The question about the cost effectiveness of surveillance for HCC in MAFLD is yet not fully answered. There are no guidelines that address the question of when to start or how to define the population who can benefit of surveillance for HCC in MAFLD patients. This review aims to revise the evidence of HCC development in MAFLD. It hopes to be a step closer to defining screening criteria for HCC in MAFLD.© The Author(s), 2023."

Hence, there is a great need for innovative, accurate, and minimally invasive tools for early cancer detection. In recent years, multi-cancer early detection (MCED) tests emerged as a promising screening tool, combining molecular analysis of tumor-related markers present in body fluids with artificial intelligence to simultaneously detect a variety of cancers and further discriminate the underlying cancer type. Herein, we aim to provide a highlight of the variety of strategies currently under development concerning MCED, as well as the major factors which are preventing clinical implementation.

With CpG-wise differential analysis, three epigenetic signatures were identified: (a) cell type- and treatment-specific signature; (b) cell type-specific senescence-related signature; and (c) cell type-transversal replicative senescence-related signature. Cluster analysis revealed that only replicative senescent cells created a distinct group reflecting notable alterations in the DNA methylation patterns accompanying this cellular state. Replicative senescence-associated epigenetic changes seemed to be of such an extent that they surpassed interpersonal dissimilarities. Enrichment in pathways linked to the nervous system and involved in the neurological functions was shown after pathway analysis of genes involved in the cell type-transversal replicative senescence-related signature. Although DNA methylation clock analysis provided no statistically significant evidence on epigenetic age acceleration related to senescence, a persistent trend of increased biological age in replicative senescent cultures of all three cell types was observed. Overall, this work indicates the heterogeneity of senescent cells depending on the tissue of origin and the type of senescence inducer that could be putatively translated to a distinct impact on tissue homeostasis."

The mutant protein accumulation is responsible for neuronal dysfunction and cell death. This is due to the involvement of oxidative damage, excitotoxicity, inflammation, and mitochondrial impairment. Neurons naturally adapt to bioenergetic alteration and oxidative stress in physiological conditions. However, this dynamic system is compromised when a neurodegenerative disorder occurs, resulting in changes in metabolism, alteration in calcium signaling, and impaired substrates transport.

To investigate Vpr modulation of aldosterone-mediated regulation of the expression of Na-Cl cotransporterSlc12a3and sodium reabsorption in distal nephron segments, we performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing of kidney cortices of wild-type (WT) and Vpr transgenic (Vpr Tg) mice on low sodium diet and a WT mouse on regular chow. In Vpr Tg mouse,Slc12a3expression was downregulated in connecting tubules (CNT) and late distal convoluted tubules (DCT2) but not in early DCT (DCT1). Mineralocorticoid receptor (Nr3c2) expression was higher in CNT and DCT2 than in DCT1. DCT1 cell percentage in salt-depleted Vpr Tg was lower (1.8%) compared with salt-depleted or salt-replete WT (3.7% and 3.6%, respectively). Sub-clustering confirmed thatPvalb+DCT1 subcluster had fewer cells in Vpr Tg (0.95%) compared with salt-depleted or salt-replete WT (2.9% and 3.1%, respectively). Autophagy and protein ubiquitination genes were upregulated in DCT1 subcluster of Vpr Tg mice.In situhybridization and immunohistochemistry demonstrated fewerSlc12a3+Pvalb+DCT1 segments in Vpr Tg mice. Downregulation ofSlc12a3and higher levels ofNr3c2in the CNT/DCT2 suggested that the aldosterone-mediated upregulation ofSlc12a3with salt depletion was most prominently inhibited by Vpr in the CNT/DCT2. These observations demonstrate that the salt-wasting effect of Vpr in Vpr Tg mice is mediated by loss ofSlc12a3+Pvalb+DCT1 segments. The downregulation ofSlc12a3occurred in more distal segments rather than in DCT1."

Here we describe a novel approach, sciPlex-ATAC-seq, which uses unmodified DNA oligos as sample-specific nuclear labels, enabling the concurrent profiling of chromatin accessibility within single nuclei from virtually unlimited specimens or experimental conditions. We first demonstrate our method with a chemical epigenomics screen, in which we identify drug-altered distal regulatory sites predictive of compound- and dose-dependent effects on transcription. We then analyze cell type-specific chromatin changes in PBMCs from multiple donors responding to synthetic and allogeneic immune stimulation. We quantify stimulation-altered immune cell compositions and isolate the unique effects of allogeneic stimulation on chromatin accessibility specific to T-lymphocytes. Finally, we observe that impaired global chromatin decondensation often coincides with chemical inhibition of allogeneic T-cell activation."

However, the mechanisms that regulate lineage commitment of naive dermal progenitors to form niches around the hair follicle, dermis, and hypodermis, are unknown. In our study, we used multimodal single-cell approaches, epigenetic assays, and allografting techniques to define a DFP state and the mechanisms that govern its differentiation potential. Our results indicate that the overall chromatin profile of DFPs is repressed by H3K27me3 and has inaccessible chromatin at lineage specific genes. Surprisingly, the repressed chromatin profile of DFPs renders them unable to reform skin in allograft assays despite their multipotent potential. Distinct fibroblast lineages, such as the dermal papilla and adipocytes contained specific chromatin profiles that were de-repressed during late embryogenesis by the H3K27-me3 demethylase, Kdm6b/Jmjd3. Tissue-specific deletion of Kdm6b/Jmjd3 resulted in ablating the adipocyte compartment and inhibiting mature dermal papilla functions in single-cell-RNA-seq, ChIPseq, and allografting assays. Altogether our studies reveal a mechanistic multimodal understanding of how DFPs differentiate into distinct fibroblast lineages, and we provide a novel multiomic search-tool within skinregeneration.org."
"36905926","Nuclear receptor Nr5a2 promotes diverse connective tissue fates in the jaw.","Dev Cell","Organ development involves the sustained production of diverse cell types with spatiotemporal precision. In the vertebrate jaw, neural-crest-derived progenitors produce not only skeletal tissues but also later-forming tendons and salivary glands. Here we identify the pluripotency factor Nr5a2 as essential for cell-fate decisions in the jaw. In zebrafish and mice, we observe transient expression of Nr5a2 in a subset of mandibular postmigratory neural-crest-derived cells. In zebrafish nr5a2 mutants, nr5a2-expressing cells that would normally form tendons generate excess jaw cartilage. In mice, neural-crest-specific Nr5a2 loss results in analogous skeletal and tendon defects in the jaw and middle ear, as well as salivary gland loss. Single-cell profiling shows that Nr5a2, distinct from its roles in pluripotency, promotes jaw-specific chromatin accessibility and gene expression that is essential for tendon and gland fates. Thus, repurposing of Nr5a2 promotes connective tissue fates to generate the full repertoire of derivatives required for jaw and middle ear function.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

Uterine natural killer (uNK) cells are the major subpopulation of decidual immune cells, which are crucial for placentation. In a previous study, we found that ovarian stimulation impairs uNK cell density on gestation day (GD) 8.5 in mice. However, it was not clear how ovarian stimulation led to a reduction in the density of uNK cells. In this study, we constructed two mouse models, an in vitro mouse embryo transfer model and an estrogen-stimulated mouse model. We used HE and PAS glycogen staining, immunohistochemical techniques, q-PCR, Western blot, and flow cytometry to analyze the mouse decidua and placenta, and the results showed that SO resulted in a fetal weight reduction, abnormal placental morphology, decreased placental vascular density, and abnormal density and function of uNK cells. Our results suggest that ovarian stimulation resulted in aberrant estrogen signaling and may contribute to the disorder of uNK cells caused by ovarian stimulation. Together, these results provide new insights into the mechanisms of aberrant maternal endocrine environments and abnormal placentation."

Two-dimensional (2D) monolayer cell culture systems are the most used cell-based assays, but these platforms are not able to reproduce the microenvironment of in vivo cells. This limitation can be surpassed using three-dimensional (3D) culture systems such as spheroids that more effectively mimic in vivo cell interactions. Herein, we evaluated the effect of scrapie prion infection in monolayer-cultured ovine bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (oBM-MSCs) and oBM-MSC-derived spheroids in growth and neurogenic conditions, analyzing their cell viability and their ability to maintain prion infection. An MTT assay was performed in oBM-MSCs and spheroids subjected to three conditions: inoculated with brain homogenate from scrapie-infected sheep, inoculated with brain homogenate from healthy sheep, and non-inoculated controls. The 3D conditions improved the cell viability in most cases, although in scrapie-infected spheroids in growth conditions, a decrease in cell viability was observed. The levels of pathological prion protein (PrPSc) in scrapie-infected oBM-MSCs and spheroids were measured by ELISA. In neurogenic conditions, monolayer cells and spheroids maintained the levels of PrPScover time. In growth conditions, however, oBM-MSCs showed decreasing levels of PrPScthroughout time, whereas spheroids were able to maintain stable PrPSclevels. The presence of PrPScin spheroids was also confirmed by immunocytochemistry. Altogether, these results show that a 3D culture microenvironment improves the permissiveness of oBM-MSCs to scrapie infection in growth conditions and maintains the infection ability in neurogenic conditions, making this model of potential use for prion studies."

The majority of candidate causal variants are in non-coding regions and likely modulate cancer risk by regulating gene expression. However, pinpointing the exact target of the association, and identifying the phenotype it mediates, is a major challenge in the interpretation and translation of GWAS.Here, we show that pooled CRISPR screens are highly effective at identifying GWAS target genes and defining the cancer phenotypes they mediate. Following CRISPR mediated gene activation or suppression, we measure proliferation in 2D, 3D, and in immune-deficient mice, as well as the effect on DNA repair. We perform 60 CRISPR screens and identify 20 genes predicted with high confidence to be GWAS targets that promote cancer by driving proliferation or modulating the DNA damage response in breast cells. We validate the regulation of a subset of these genes by breast cancer risk variants.We demonstrate that phenotypic CRISPR screens can accurately pinpoint the gene target of a risk locus. In addition to defining gene targets of risk loci associated with increased breast cancer risk, we provide a platform for identifying gene targets and phenotypes mediated by risk variants.© 2023.

We performed pooled CRISPR screens to test the impact of sequences at or near CAD-associated genetic variants on vascular endothelial cell functions. Using CRISPR knockout, inhibition and activation, we targeted 1998 variants at 83 CAD loci to assess their effect on three adhesion proteins (E-selectin, ICAM1, VCAM1) and three key endothelial functions (nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species production, calcium signalling). At a false discovery rate ≤10%, we identified significant CRISPR perturbations near 42 variants located within 26 CAD loci. We used base editing to validate a putative causal variant in the promoter of the FES gene. Although a few of the loci include genes previously characterized in endothelial cells (e.g. AIDA, ARHGEF26, ADAMTS7), most are implicated in endothelial dysfunction for the first time. Detailed characterization of one of these new loci implicated the RNA helicase DHX38 in vascular endothelial cell senescence. While promising, our results also highlighted several limitations in using CRISPR perturbations to functionally dissect GWAS loci, including an unknown false negative rate and potential off-target effects.Copyright: © 2023 Wünnemann et al.

"36999000","The RNA-Seq data analysis shows how the ontogenesis defines aging.","Front Aging","This paper presents a global statistical analysis of the RNA-Seq results of the entireMus musculusgenome. We explain aging by a gradual redistribution of limited resources between two major tasks of the organism: its self-sustenance based on the function of the housekeeping gene group (HG) and functional differentiation provided by the integrative gene group (IntG). All known disorders associated with aging are the result of a deficiency in the repair processes provided by the cellular infrastructure. Understanding exactly how this deficiency arises is our primary goal. Analysis of RNA production data of 35,630 genes, from which 5,101 were identified as HG genes, showed that RNA production levels in the HG and IntG genes had statistically significant differences (p-value <0.0001) throughout the entire observation period. In the reproductive period of life, which has the lowest actual mortality risk forMus musculus, changes in the age dynamics of RNA production occur. The statistically significant dynamics of the decrease of RNA production in the HG group in contrast to the IntG group was determined (p-value = 0.0045). The trend toward significant shift in the HG/IntG ratio occurs after the end of the reproductive period, coinciding with the beginning of the mortality rate increase inMus musculusindirectly supports our hypothesis. The results demonstrate a different orientation of the impact of ontogenesis regulatory mechanisms on the groups of genes representing cell infrastructures and their organismal functions, making the chosen direction promising for further research and understanding the mechanisms of aging.Copyright © 2023 Salnikov, Goldberg, Rijhwani, Shi and Pinsky."

In echolocating bats, the ability to discern high frequencies is essential. However, nothing is known about age-related hearing loss in bats, and they are often assumed to be immune to it. We tested the hearing of 47 wild Egyptian fruit bats by recording their auditory brainstem response and cochlear microphonics, and we also assessed the cochlear histology in four of these bats. We used the bats' DNA methylation profile to evaluate their age and found that bats exhibit age-related hearing loss, with more prominent deterioration at the higher frequencies. The rate of the deterioration was ∼1 dB per year, comparable to the hearing loss observed in humans. Assessing the noise in the fruit bat roost revealed that these bats are exposed to continuous immense noise-mostly of social vocalizations-supporting the assumption that bats might be partially resistant to loud noise. Thus, in contrast to previous assumptions, our results suggest that bats constitute a model animal for the study of age-related hearing loss.© 2023 Tarnovsky et al."

Here, we summarize recent advances in the use of CNV reporters that provide a facile means of quantifying de novo CNVs at a specific locus in the genome, and nanopore sequencing, for resolving the often complex structures of CNVs. We provide guidance for the engineering and analysis of CNV reporters and practical guidelines for single-cell analysis of CNVs using flow cytometry. We summarize recent advances in nanopore sequencing, discuss the utility of this technology, and provide guidance for the bioinformatic analysis of these data to define the molecular structure of CNVs. The combination of reporter systems for tracking and isolating CNV lineages and long-read DNA sequencing for characterizing CNV structures enables unprecedented resolution of the mechanisms by which CNVs are generated and their evolutionary dynamics.© 2023.

"36945442","Structurally divergent and recurrently mutated regions of primate genomes.","bioRxiv","To better understand the pattern of primate genome structural variation, we sequenced and assembled using multiple long-read sequencing technologies the genomes of eight nonhuman primate species, including New World monkeys (owl monkey and marmoset), Old World monkey (macaque), Asian apes (orangutan and gibbon), and African ape lineages (gorilla, bonobo, and chimpanzee). Compared to the human genome, we identified 1,338,997 lineage-specific fixed structural variants (SVs) disrupting 1,561 protein-coding genes and 136,932 regulatory elements, including the most complete set of human-specific fixed differences. Across 50 million years of primate evolution, we estimate that 819.47 Mbp or ~27% of the genome has been affected by SVs based on analysis of these primate lineages. We identify 1,607 structurally divergent regions (SDRs) wherein recurrent structural variation contributes to creating SV hotspots where genes are recurrently lost (CARDs,ABCD7,OLAH) and new lineage-specific genes are generated (e.g.,CKAP2,NEK5) and have become targets of rapid chromosomal diversification and positive selection (e.g.,RGPDs). High-fidelity long-read sequencing has made these dynamic regions of the genome accessible for sequence-level analyses within and between primate species for the first time."
"36980673","Optimisation Models for Pathway Activity Inference in Cancer.","Cancers (Basel)","With advances in high-throughput technologies, there has been an enormous increase in data related to profiling the activity of molecules in disease. While such data provide more comprehensive information on cellular actions, their large volume and complexity pose difficulty in accurate classification of disease phenotypes. Therefore, novel modelling methods that can improve accuracy while offering interpretable means of analysis are required. Biological pathways can be used to incorporate a priori knowledge of biological interactions to decrease data dimensionality and increase the biological interpretability of machine learning models.A mathematical optimisation model is proposed for pathway activity inference towards precise disease phenotype prediction and is applied to RNA-Seq datasets. The model is based on mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) mathematical optimisation principles and infers pathway activity as the linear combination of pathway member gene expression, multiplying expression values with model-determined gene weights that are optimised to maximise discrimination of phenotype classes and minimise incorrect sample allocation.The model is evaluated on the transcriptome of breast and colorectal cancer, and exhibits solution results of good optimality as well as good prediction performance on related cancer subtypes. Two baseline pathway activity inference methods and three advanced methods are used for comparison. Sample prediction accuracy, robustness against noise expression data, and survival analysis suggest competitive prediction performance of our model while providing interpretability and insight on key pathways and genes. Overall, our work demonstrates that the flexible nature of mathematical programming lends itself well to developing efficient computational strategies for pathway activity inference and disease subtype prediction."

Although the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of age-related disorders such as NAFLD remain incompletely understood, recent studies have implicated the accumulation of senescent cells as a contributing factor. Here, we show that tristetraprolin (TTP) deficiency accelerates NAFLD during aging by enhancing the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) as well as several hallmarks of senescence. The sequestration of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1, a mediator of cellular senescence, in stress granules, (SGs) inhibits cellular senescence. In our previous report, we have shown that carbon monoxide (CO), a small gaseous mediator, can induce the assembly of SGsviaan integrated stress response. Here, we show that CO treatment promotes the assembly of SGs which can sequester PAI-1, resulting in the inhibition of etoposide (ETO)-induced cellular senescence. Notably, CO-induced TTP activation enhances PAI-1 degradation, leading to protection against ETO-induced cellular senescence. CO-dependent Sirt1 activation promotes the inclusion of TTP into SGs, leading to decreased PAI-1 levels. Therefore, our findings highlight the importance of TTP as a therapeutic target in age-related NAFLD and offer a potential new strategy to reduce the detrimental effects of senescent cells in hepatic disorders.copyright: © 2022 Park et al."

Cells use numerous dedicated DNA repair systems to detect damage and restore genomic integrity in a timely manner. Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) is a key enzyme providing dNTPs for DNA repair. Molecular mechanisms of indirect regulation of yeast RNR activity are well understood, whereas little is known about its direct regulation. The study was aimed at elucidation of the proteasome-dependent mechanism of direct regulation of RNR subunits inSaccharomyces cerevisiae. Proteome analysis followed by Western blot, RT-PCR, and yeast plating analysis showed that upregulation of RNR by proteasome deregulation is associated with yeast hyper resistance to 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-NQO), a UV-mimetic DNA-damaging drug used in animal models to study oncogenesis. Inhibition of RNR or deletion of RNR regulatory proteins reverses the phenotype of yeast hyper resistance to 4-NQO. We have shown for the first time that the yeast Rnr1 subunit is a substrate of the proteasome, which suggests a common mechanism of RNR regulation in yeast and mammals."

The genotyping was performed using the PCR-RFLP method. A statistically significant higher frequency of theDNMT3Brs2424913 TT in the DSCHD+ individuals was observed. TheDNMT3Brs2424913 TT genotype, as well as the T allele, had significantly higher frequencies in the individuals with DS and atrial septal defects (ASDs) in comparison with the individuals with DS and other CHDs. Furthermore, our results indicate a statistically significant effect of theDNMT3Brs1569686 TT genotype in individuals with non-syndromic CHDs.

Although the literature has identified some changes in rich-club organization with age, little is known about potential sex-specific developmental trajectories, and neurophysiologically relevant frequency-dependent changes have not been established. Here we examine the frequency- and sex-dependent development of rich-club organization using magnetoencephalography in a large normative sample (N = 383) over a wide age span (4-39 years). We report strong divergence between males and females across alpha, beta, and gamma frequencies. While males show increased or no change in rich-club organization with age, females show a consistent, non-linear trajectory that increases through childhood, shifting direction in early adolescence. Using neurophysiological modalities for capturing complex inter-relations between oscillatory dynamics, age, and sex, we establish diverging, sex-specific developmental trajectories of the brain's core functional organization, critically important to our understanding of brain health and disease.© 2023 The Author(s)."

Aqueous-deficient DED is more prevalent in women, suggesting that sexual dimorphism of the human lacrimal gland could be a potential cause. Sex steroid hormones are a key factor in the development of sexual dimorphism. This study aimed to quantify estrogen receptor (ER) and androgen receptor (AR) expression in the human lacrimal gland and compare it between sexes. RNA was isolated from 35 human lacrimal gland tissue samples collected from 19 cornea donors. AR, ERα, and ERβ mRNA was identified in all samples, and their expression was quantified using qPCR. Immunohistochemical staining was performed on selected samples to evaluate protein expression of the receptors. ERα mRNA expression was significantly higher than the expression of AR and ERβ. No difference in sex steroid hormone (SSH) receptor mRNA expression was observed between sexes, and no correlation was observed with age. If ERα protein expression is found to be concordant with mRNA expression, it should be investigated further as a potential target for hormone therapy of DED. Further research is needed to elucidate the role of sex steroid hormone receptors in sex-related differences of lacrimal gland structure and disease."

The heterogeneity of ARDS and sepsis has long been observed, and multiple subphenotypes and endotypes correlated with different outcomes and treatment response have been identified in the search for treatable traits. Despite their similarity to typical ARDS and sepsis, COVID-19-associated ARDS and sepsis harbor distinct features, raising the question as to whether they could be considered as subphenotypes or endotypes of the historical syndromes and, accordingly, benefit from specific therapeutic strategies. This review aimed to summarize and discuss the current knowledge of COVID-19-associated critical illness and the intrinsic subphenotypes or endotypes.Literature on the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and the subphenotyping of COVID-19-associated critical illness was derived from the PubMed database and reviewed.Accumulating evidence, varying from clinical observation to basic research, has contributed to revealing the fundamental pathophysiological features of severe COVID-19 and has advanced our knowledge of the disease. COVID-19-associated ARDS and sepsis exhibit some distinctive features compared to the classic syndromes, including remarkable vascular abnormality and coagulopathy, and distinct respiratory mechanics and immune response. Some conventional subphenotypes derived from classic ARDS and sepsis have been validated in COVID-19, while novel subphenotypes and endotypes have also been identified in patients with this disease, who experience variable clinical outcomes and treatment responses.Subphenotyping of COVID-19-associated ARDS and sepsis can provide new insights into the development and management of these illnesses.2023 Annals of Translational Medicine.

"36992283","Regulatory T Cells (Tregs) and COVID-19: Unveiling the Mechanisms, and Therapeutic Potentialities with a Special Focus on Long COVID.","Vaccines (Basel)","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused havoc all around the world. The causative agent of COVID-19 is the novel form of the coronavirus (CoV) named SARS-CoV-2, which results in immune system disruption, increased inflammation, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). T cells have been important components of the immune system, which decide the fate of the COVID-19 disease. Recent studies have reported an important subset of T cells known as regulatory T cells (Tregs), which possess immunosuppressive and immunoregulatory properties and play a crucial role in the prognosis of COVID-19 disease. Recent studies have shown that COVID-19 patients have considerably fewer Tregs than the general population. Such a decrement may have an impact on COVID-19 patients in a number of ways, including diminishing the effect of inflammatory inhibition, creating an inequality in the Treg/Th17 percentage, and raising the chance of respiratory failure. Having fewer Tregs may enhance the likelihood of long COVID development in addition to contributing to the disease's poor prognosis. Additionally, tissue-resident Tregs provide tissue repair in addition to immunosuppressive and immunoregulatory activities, which may aid in the recovery of COVID-19 patients. The severity of the illness is also linked to abnormalities in the Tregs' phenotype, such as reduced expression of FoxP3 and other immunosuppressive cytokines, including IL-10 and TGF-beta. Hence, in this review, we summarize the immunosuppressive mechanisms and their possible roles in the prognosis of COVID-19 disease. Furthermore, the perturbations in Tregs have been associated with disease severity. The roles of Tregs are also explained in the long COVID. This review also discusses the potential therapeutic roles of Tregs in the management of patients with COVID-19."

Plasma proteomic profiling of 4,301 proteins was performed in two independent datasets and tested for the association for three COVID-19 outcomes (infection, ventilation, and death). We identified 1,449 proteins consistently associated in both datasets with any of these three outcomes. We subsequently created highly accurate models that distinctively predict infection, ventilation, and death. These proteins were enriched in specific biological processes including cytokine signaling, Alzheimer's disease, and coronary artery disease. Mendelian randomization and gene network analyses identified eight causal proteins and 141 highly connected hub proteins including 35 with known drug targets. Our findings provide distinctive prognostic biomarkers for two severe COVID-19 outcomes, reveal their relationship to Alzheimer's disease and coronary artery disease, and identify potential therapeutic targets for COVID-19 outcomes.© 2023 The Author(s)."
"37012448","A relay velocity model infers cell-dependent RNA velocity.","Nat Biotechnol","RNA velocity provides an approach for inferring cellular state transitions from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Conventional RNA velocity models infer universal kinetics from all cells in an scRNA-seq experiment, resulting in unpredictable performance in experiments with multi-stage and/or multi-lineage transition of cell states where the assumption of the same kinetic rates for all cells no longer holds. Here we present cellDancer, a scalable deep neural network that locally infers velocity for each cell from its neighbors and then relays a series of local velocities to provide single-cell resolution inference of velocity kinetics. In the simulation benchmark, cellDancer shows robust performance in multiple kinetic regimes, high dropout ratio datasets and sparse datasets. We show that cellDancer overcomes the limitations of existing RNA velocity models in modeling erythroid maturation and hippocampus development. Moreover, cellDancer provides cell-specific predictions of transcription, splicing and degradation rates, which we identify as potential indicators of cell fate in the mouse pancreas.© 2023.

Previous studies have shown that pretreatment with sevoflurane is efficient in reducing the incidence of PTSD. However, we require a more comprehensive understanding of the specific mechanisms by which sevoflurane works. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) has been reported to be regulated by sevoflurane, and to improve patient cognition. In this study, we aimed to explore the mechanisms of sevoflurane and the role of EZH2 in PTSD cases. We explored the effects of sevoflurane and EPZ-6438 (inhibitor of EZH2) on rat behavior, followed by an investigation of EZH2 mRNA and protein expression. The effects of sevoflurane and EZH2 on neuronal survival were assessed by western blotting and TUNEL staining, while western blotting was used to examine the expression of PSD95 and the AKT/mTOR proteins. Sevoflurane preconditioning restored EZH2 expression and significantly inhibited apoptosis by regulating phosphorylation of the AKT/mTOR pathway. Synaptic plasticity was also significantly improved. These results suggest that pretreatment with sevoflurane could play an important role in PTSD prevention by regulating EZH2 expression.© 2023. The Author(s)."

However, in 10-15% of congenital cases, this beta-herpesvirus demonstrates direct effects on the central nervous system, including microcephaly, cognitive/learning delays, and hearing deficits. HCMV has been widely shown to infect neural progenitor cells, but the permissiveness of fully differentiated neurons to HCMV is controversial and chronically understudied, despite potential associations between HCMV infection with neurodegenerative conditions. Using a model system representative of the human forebrain, we demonstrate that induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived, excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory GABAergic neurons are fully permissive to HCMV, demonstrating complete viral replication, competent virion production, and spread within the culture. Interestingly, while cell proliferation was not induced in these post-mitotic neurons, HCMV did increase expression of proliferative markers Ki67 and PCNA suggesting alterations in cell cycle machinery. These finding are consistent with previous HCMV-mediated changes in various cell types and implicate the virusâ€™ ability to alter proliferative pathways to promote virion production. HCMV also induces significant structural changes in forebrain neurons, such as the formation of syncytia and retraction of neurites. Finally, we demonstrate that HCMV disrupts calcium signaling and decreases neurotransmission, with action potential generation effectively silenced after 15 days post infection. Taken together, our data highlight the potential for forebrain neurons to be permissive to HCMV infection in the CNS, which could have significant implications on overall brain health and function."
"37010548","Impact of antigen retrieval protocols on the immunohistochemical detection of epigenetic DNA modifications.","Histochem Cell Biol","This study compares three different pretreatment protocols for the immunohistochemical detection of 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) in nuclear DNA. The human biological samples analyzed included formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) normal squamous epithelium, ethanol-fixed cultured cells, and metaphase chromosomes. The antigen retrieval methods included low pH Citrate and high pH Tris-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) protocols, as well as a method using Pepsin pretreatment combined with HCl for DNA denaturation. A gradual increase in the detection levels of 5-mC and 5-hmC was observed when going from Citrate via Tris/EDTA to Pepsin/HCl retrieval. While the Citrate retrieval protocol was the least efficient for the detection of 5-mC and 5-hmC, it did preserve nuclear morphology and enabled visualization of differences in intra- and internuclear distribution patterns in tissue and cell culture samples by single- and double-fluorescence detection. Quantification of (hydroxy)methylation levels in FFPE material demonstrated a significant heterogeneity and differences in 5-mC and 5-hmC levels within and between nuclei in the different compartments of normal squamous epithelium. It was concluded that immunohistochemical detection of 5-mC and 5-hmC enables the correlation of these DNA modifications with histomorphological features in heterogeneous tissues, but this is influenced by different pretreatment protocols that must be carefully chosen to allow an appropriate interpretation of these epigenetic switches.© 2023.

However, the function of FBXW7, especially the mutations, is not clear. This study was designed to investigate the functional significance of FBXW7 loss of function and underlying mechanism in ESCC.Immunofluorescence was applied to clarify the localization and main isoform of FBXW7 in ESCC cells. Sanger sequencing were performed to explore mutations of FBXW7 in ESCC tissues. Proliferation, colony, invasion and migration assays were performed to examine the functional roles of FBXW7 in ESCC cells in vitro and in vivo. Real-time RT-PCR, immunoblotting, GST-pulldown, LC-MS/MS and co-immunoprecipitation assay were used to explore the molecular mechanism underlying the actions of FBXW7 functional inactivation in ESCC cells. Immunohistochemical staining were used to explore the expression of FBXW7 and MAP4 in ESCC tissues.The main FBXW7 isoform in ESCC cells was the β transcript in the cytoplasm. Functional inactivation of FBXW7 led to activation of the MAPK signaling pathway and upregulation of the downstream MMP3 and VEGFA, which enhanced tumor proliferation cell invasion and migration. Among the five mutation forms screened, S327X (X means truncated mutation) had an effect similar to the FBXW7 deficiency and led to the inactivation of FBXW7 in ESCC cells. Three other point mutations, S382F, D400N and R425C, attenuated but did not eliminate FBXW7 function. The other truncating mutation, S598X, which was located outside of the WD40 domain, revealed a tiny attenuation of FBXW7 in ESCC cells. Notably, MAP4 was identified as a potential target of FBXW7. The threonine T521 of MAP4, which was phosphorylated by CHEK1, played a key role in the FBXW7-related degradation system. Immunohistochemical staining indicated that FBXW7 loss of function was associated with tumor stage and shorter survival of patients with ESCC. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses showed that high FBXW7 and low MAP4 was an independent prognostic indicator and prospective longer survival. Moreover, a combination regimen that included MK-8353 to inhibit the phosphorylation of ERK and bevacizumab to inhibit VEGFA produced potent inhibitory effects on the growth of FBXW7 inactivation xenograft tumors in vivo.This study provided evidence that FBXW7 loss of function promoted ESCC via MAP4 overexpression and ERK phosphorylation, and this novel FBXW7/MAP4/ERK axis may be an efficient target for ESCC treatment.© 2023.

Mutant somatic cells that evade immune surveillance can lead to cancer. Neurons with complex karyotypes arise during neurotypical brain development, but neurons are almost never the origin of brain cancers. Instead, somatic mutations in neurons can bring about neurodevelopmental disorders, and contribute to the polygenic landscape of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disease. A subset of human neurons harbors idiosyncratic copy number variants (CNVs, ""CNV neurons""), but previous analyses of CNV neurons have been limited by relatively small sample sizes. Here, we developed an allele-based validation approach, SCOVAL, to corroborate or reject read-depth based CNV calls in single human neurons. We applied this approach to 2,125 frontal cortical neurons from a neurotypical human brain. This approach identified 226 CNV neurons, as well as a class of CNV neurons with complex karyotypes containing whole or substantial losses on multiple chromosomes. Moreover, we found that CNV location appears to be nonrandom. Recurrent regions of neuronal genome rearrangement contained fewer, but longer, genes."

Our goal was to identify a whole blood differential gene expression signature for pediatric acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) using transcriptomic microarrays within twenty-four hours of diagnosis. We used publicly available human whole-blood gene expression arrays of a Berlin-defined pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (GSE147902) cohort and a sepsis-triggered AHRF (GSE66099) cohort within twenty-four hours of diagnosis and compared those children with a PaO2/FiO2 < 200 to those with a PaO2/FiO2 ≥ 200.We used stability selection, a bootstrapping method of 100 simulations using logistic regression as a classifier, to select differentially expressed genes associated with a PaO2/FiO2 < 200 vs. PaO2/FiO2 ≥ 200. The top-ranked genes that contributed to the AHRF signature were selected in each dataset. Genes common to both of the top 1,500 ranked gene lists were selected for pathway analysis. Pathway and network analysis was performed using the Pathway Network Analysis Visualizer (PANEV) and Reactome was used to perform an over-representation gene network analysis of the top-ranked genes common to both cohorts. Changes in metabolic pathways involved in energy balance, fundamental cellular processes such as protein translation, mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, immune signaling, and inflammation are differentially regulated early in pediatric ARDS and sepsis-induced AHRF compared to both healthy controls and to milder acute hypoxemia. Specifically, fundamental pathways related to the severity of hypoxemia emerged and included (1) ribosomal and eukaryotic initiation of factor 2 (eIF2) regulation of protein translation and (2) the nutrient, oxygen, and energy sensing pathway, mTOR, activatedviaPI3K/AKT signaling.Cellular energetics and metabolic pathways are important mechanisms to consider to further our understanding of the heterogeneity and underlying pathobiology of moderate and severe pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Here, we assess the causal relationships between the human microbiome (gut and oral microbiota) and longevity, by leveraging bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses based on genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics of the gut and oral microbiome from the 4D-SZ cohort and longevity from the CLHLS cohort. We found that some disease-protected gut microbiota such as Coriobacteriaceae and Oxalobacter as well as the probiotic Lactobacillus amylovorus were related to increased odds of longevity, whereas the other gut microbiota such as colorectal cancer pathogen Fusobacterium nucleatum, Coprococcus, Streptococcus, Lactobacillus, and Neisseria were negatively associated with longevity. The reverse MR analysis further revealed genetically longevous individuals tended to have higher abundances of Prevotella and Paraprevotella but lower abundances of Bacteroides and Fusobacterium species. Few overlaps of gut microbiota-longevity interactions were identified across different populations. We also identified abundant links between the oral microbiome and longevity. The additional analysis suggested that centenarians genetically had a lower gut microbial diversity, but no difference in oral microbiota. Our findings strongly implicate these bacteria to play a role in human longevity and underscore the relocation of commensal microbes among different body sites that would need to be monitored for long and healthy life.© 2023.

To assess whether theses associations reflect causality, we carried out two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR). Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with BCAA were evaluated in 10 studies, including 24,925 participants. The association between SNPs and coronary artery disease (CAD) were assessed using summary estimates from the CARDIoGRAMplusC4D consortium. Further MR analysis of BCAAs and seven CVD outcomes was performed. The BCAA-raising gene functions were also analyzed. MR analyses revealed a risk-increasing causal relationship between serum BCAA concentrations and CAD (odds ratio 1.08; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.14), which was partly mediated by blood pressure and type 2 diabetes. BCAA also demonstrated a causal relationship with ischemic CVD events induced by plaque rupture and thrombosis (false discovery rate <0.05). Two BCAA-raising genes (MRL33andCBLN1) were preferentially associated with myocardial infarction risk in the presence of atherosclerosis (p< 0.003). Functional analysis of the BCAA-raising genes suggested the causal involvement of two pathophysiological pathways, including glucose metabolism (PPM1KandTRMT61A) related to plaque progression, and the newly discovered neuroendocrine disorders regulating blood pressure (MRPL33,CBLN1, andC2orf16) related to plaque rupture and thrombosis. This comprehensive MR analysis provided insights into the potential causal mechanisms linking BCAA with CVD risk and suggested targeting neuroendocrine disorders as a potential strategy for the prevention of CVD. These results warrant further studies to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these reported causal associations."

This study investigated the causal relationship between glaucoma and iritis and uveitis as exposures in a multi-ethnic population. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with exposures to iritis and uveitis from the genome-wide association study (GWAS) data of Biobank Japan (BBJ) and the meta-analysis data from BBJ and UK Biobank (UKB) were used as instrumental variables (IVs). The GWAS dataset for glaucoma was extracted from the meta-analysis data (n= 240,302) of Genetic Epidemiology Research in Adult Health and Aging and UKB. The casual estimates were assessed with a two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) test using the inverse-variance-weighted (IVW) method, weighted median method, MR-Egger method, and MR-Pleiotropy Residual Sum and Outlier test. The IVW method revealed a significant causal association between iritis and glaucoma using IVs (p< 5.0 × 10-8) from the East Asian population (n= 2) (odds ratio [OR] = 1.01,p= 0.017), a significant association between iritis exposures (p< 5.0 × 10-8) in the multi-ethnic population (n= 11) (OR = 1.04,p= 0.001), and a significant causal association between uveitis exposures (n= 10 withp< 5.0 × 10-8) and glaucoma in the multi-ethnic population (OR = 1.04,p= 0.001). Iritis and uveitis had causal effects on glaucoma risk based on IVs from the multi-ethnic population. These findings imply that the current classifications of uveitic glaucoma and open-angle glaucoma overlap, indicating the need for further investigating these complex relationships."

The objective of this study is to identify de novo mutations in 13 trios from singleton families that contribute to the genetic basis of T1DM through the application of whole-exome sequencing (WES). Of the 13 families sampled for this project, 12 had de novo variants, with Family 7 having the highest number (nine) of variants linked to T1DM/autoimmune pathways, whilst Family 4 did not have any variants past the filtering steps. There were 10 variants of 7 genes reportedly associated with T1DM (MST1; TDG; TYRO3; IFIHI; GLIS3; VEGFA; TYK2). There were 20 variants of 13 genes that were linked to endocrine, metabolic, or autoimmune diseases. Our findings demonstrate that trio-based WES is a powerful approach for identifying new candidate genes for the pathogenesis of T1D. Genotyping and functional annotation of the discovered de novo variants in a large cohort is recommended to ascertain their association with disease pathogenesis."
"36974476","The melatonin receptor 1B gene links circadian rhythms and type 2 diabetes mellitus: an evolutionary story.","Ann Med","Disturbed circadian rhythms have been a risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Melatonin is the major chronobiotic hormone regulating both circadian rhythm and glucose homeostasis. The rs10830963 (G allele) of themelatonin receptor 1B(MTNR1B) gene has the strongest genetic associations with T2DM according to several genome-wide association studies. TheMTNR1Brs10830963 G allele is also associated with disturbed circadian phenotypes and altered melatonin secretion, both factors that can elevate the risk of diabetes. Furthermore, evolutionary studies implied the presence of selection pressure and ethnic diversity inMTNR1B, which was consistent with the ""thrifty gene"" hypothesis in T2DM. The rs10830963 G risk allele is associated with delayed melatonin secretion onset in dim-light and prolonged duration of peak melatonin. This delayed melatonin secretion may help human ancestors adapt to famine or food shortages during long nights and early mornings and avoid nocturnal hypoglycemia but confers susceptibility to T2DM due to adequate energy intake in modern society. We provide new insight into the role ofMTNR1Bvariants in T2DMviadisturbed circadian rhythms from the perspective of the ""thrifty gene"" hypothesis; these data indicate a novel target for the prevention and treatment of susceptible populations with the thrifty genotype."

Primary aldosteronism (PA) is one of the most common causes of secondary hypertension, causing cardiovascular events at higher risk compared with essential hypertension. However, the germline genetic contribution to the susceptibility of PA has not been well elucidated.We conducted a genome-wide association analysis of PA in the Japanese population and a cross-ancestry meta-analysis combined with UK Biobank and FinnGen cohorts (816 PA cases and 425 239 controls) to identify genetic variants that contribute to PA susceptibility. We also performed a comparative analysis for the risk of 42 previously established blood pressure-associated variants between PA and hypertension with the adjustment of blood pressure.In the Japanese genome-wide association study, we identified 10 loci that presented suggestive evidence for the association with the PA risk (P<1.0×10-6). In the meta-analysis, we identified 5 genome-wide significant loci (1p13, 7p15, 11p15, 12q24, and 13q12;P<5.0×10-8), including 3 of the suggested loci in the Japanese genome-wide association study. The strongest association was observed at rs3790604 (1p13), an intronic variant ofWNT2B(odds ratio, 1.50 [95% CI, 1.33-1.69];P=5.2×10-11). We further identified 1 nearly genome-wide significant locus (8q24,CYP11B2), which presented a significant association in the gene-based test (P=7.2×10-7). Of interest, all of these loci were known to be associated with blood pressure in previous studies, presumably because of the prevalence of PA among individuals with hypertension. This assumption was supported by the observation that they had a significantly higher risk effect on PA than on hypertension. We also revealed that 66.7% of the previously established blood pressure-associated variants had a higher risk effect for PA than for hypertension.This study demonstrates the genome-wide evidence for a genetic predisposition to PA susceptibility in the cross-ancestry cohorts and its significant contribution to the genetic background of hypertension. The strongest association with theWNT2Bvariants reinforces the implication of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in the PA pathogenesis."

The enormous diversity and intricate organization of cells in the brain have so far hindered our understanding of the molecular and cellular basis of its functions. Recent advances in spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomics have allowed systematic mapping of the spatial organization of molecularly defined cell types in complex tissues1-3. However, these approaches have only been applied to a few brain regions1-11and a comprehensive cell atlas of the whole brain is still missing. Here, we imaged a panel of >1,100 genes in ∼8 million cells across the entire adult mouse brain using multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH)12and performed spatially resolved, single-cell expression profiling at the whole-transcriptome scale by integrating MERFISH and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Using this approach, we generated a comprehensive cell atlas of >5,000 transcriptionally distinct cell clusters, belonging to ∼300 major cell types, in the whole mouse brain with high molecular and spatial resolution. Registration of the MERFISH images to the common coordinate framework (CCF) of the mouse brain further allowed systematic quantifications of the cell composition and organization in individual brain regions defined in the CCF. We further identified spatial modules characterized by distinct cell-type compositions and spatial gradients featuring gradual changes in the gene-expression profiles of cells. Finally, this high-resolution spatial map of cells, with a transcriptome-wide expression profile associated with each cell, allowed us to infer cell-type-specific interactions between several hundred pairs of molecularly defined cell types and predict potential molecular (ligand-receptor) basis and functional implications of these cell-cell interactions. These results provide rich insights into the molecular and cellular architecture of the brain and a valuable resource for future functional investigations of neural circuits and their dysfunction in diseases."

The advent of Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning methods to characterize and assess bone tumours on various imaging modalities may assist in the diagnostic workflow. The purpose of this review article is to summarise the most recent evidence for AI techniques using imaging for differentiating benign from malignant lesions, the characterization of various malignant bone lesions, and their potential clinical application. A systematic search through electronic databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and clinicaltrials.gov) was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A total of 34 articles were retrieved from the databases and the key findings were compiled and summarised. A total of 34 articles reported the use of AI techniques to distinguish between benign vs. malignant bone lesions, of which 12 (35.3%) focused on radiographs, 12 (35.3%) on MRI, 5 (14.7%) on CT and 5 (14.7%) on PET/CT. The overall reported accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of AI in distinguishing between benign vs. malignant bone lesions ranges from 0.44-0.99, 0.63-1.00, and 0.73-0.96, respectively, with AUCs of 0.73-0.96. In conclusion, the use of AI to discriminate bone lesions on imaging has achieved a relatively good performance in various imaging modalities, with high sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for distinguishing between benign vs. malignant lesions in several cohort studies. However, further research is necessary to test the clinical performance of these algorithms before they can be facilitated and integrated into routine clinical practice."

Milk protein genes are controlled by distal enhancers activating expression several hundred-fold during lactation. However, the role of promoter elements is not understood. We addressed this issue using theCsn2gene, which accounts for 10% of mRNA in mammary tissue. We identified STAT5 and other mammary transcription factors binding to three distal candidate enhancers and a cytokine-response promoter element. While deletion of the enhancers or the introduction of an inactivating mutation in a single promoter element had a marginable effect, their combined loss led to a 99.99% reduction ofCsn2expression. Our findings reveal the essential role of a promoter element in the exceptional activation of a milk protein gene and highlight the importance of analyzing regulatory elements in their native genomic context to fully understand the multifaceted functions of enhancer clusters and promoters."
"37016180","Yearning for machine learning: applications for the classification and characterisation of senescence.","Cell Tissue Res","Senescence is a widely appreciated tumour suppressive mechanism, which acts as a barrier to cancer development by arresting cell cycle progression in response to harmful stimuli. However, senescent cell accumulation becomes deleterious in aging and contributes to a wide range of age-related pathologies. Furthermore, senescence has beneficial roles and is associated with a growing list of normal physiological processes including wound healing and embryonic development. Therefore, the biological role of senescent cells has become increasingly nuanced and complex. The emergence of sophisticated, next-generation profiling technologies, such as single-cell RNA sequencing, has accelerated our understanding of the heterogeneity of senescence, with distinct final cell states emerging within models as well as between cell types and tissues. In order to explore data sets of increasing size and complexity, the senescence field has begun to employ machine learning (ML) methodologies to probe these intricacies. Most notably, ML has been used to aid the classification of cells as senescent, as well as to characterise the final senescence phenotypes. Here, we provide a background to the principles of ML tasks, as well as some of the most commonly used methodologies from both traditional and deep ML. We focus on the application of these within the context of senescence research, by addressing the utility of ML for the analysis of data from different laboratory technologies (microscopy, transcriptomics, proteomics, methylomics), as well as the potential within senolytic drug discovery. Together, we aim to highlight both the progress and potential for the application of ML within senescence research.© 2023. Crown."
"36973960","Understanding and controlling asthma in Latin America: A review of recent research informed by the SCAALA programme.","Clin Transl Allergy","Asthma is an important health concern in Latin America (LA) where it is associated with variable prevalence and disease burden between countries. High prevalence and morbidity have been observed in some regions, particularly marginalized urban populations. Research over the past 10 years from LA has shown that childhood disease is primarily non-atopic. The attenuation of atopy may be explained by enhanced immune regulation induced by intense exposures to environmental factors such as childhood infections and poor environmental conditions of the urban poor. Non-atopic symptoms are associated with environmental and lifestyle factors including poor living conditions, respiratory infections, psychosocial stress, obesity, and a diet of highly processed foods. Ancestry (particularly African) and genetic factors increase asthma risk, and some of these factors may be specific to LA settings. Asthma in LA tends to be poorly controlled and depends on access to health care and medications. There is a need to improve management and access to medication through primary health care. Future research should consider the heterogeneity of asthma to identify relevant endotypes and underlying causes. The outcome of such research will need to focus on implementable strategies relevant to populations living in resource-poor settings where the disease burden is greatest.© 2023 The Authors.

This study aimed to construct the prognostic features composed of ZNF family genes to effectively predict the prognosis of ESCA patients.The mRNA expression matrix and clinical data were downloaded from TCGA and GEO database. Using univariate Cox analysis, lasso regression and multivariate Cox analysis, we screened six prognosis-related ZNF family genes to construct the prognostic model. We then used Kaplan-Meier plot, time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC), multivariable Cox regression analysis of clinical information, and nomogram to evaluate the prognostic value within and across sets, separately and combined. We also validated the prognostic value of the six-gene signature using GSE53624 dataset. The different immune status was observed in the single sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA). Finally, real-time quantitative PCR was used to detect the expression of six prognostic ZNF genes in twelve pairs of ESCA and adjacent normal tissues.A six prognosis-related ZNF family genes model consisted of ZNF91, ZNF586, ZNF502, ZNF865, ZNF106 and ZNF225 was identified. Multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed that six prognosis-related ZNF family genes were independent prognostic factors for overall survival of ESCA patients in TCGA and GSE53624. Further, a prognostic nomogram including the riskScore, age, gender, T, stage was constructed, and TCGA/GSE53624-based calibration plots indicated its excellent predictive performance. Drug Sensitivity and ssGSEA analysis showed that the six genes model was closely related to immune cells infiltration and could be used as a potential predictor of chemotherapy sensitivity.We identified six prognosis-related ZNF family genes model of ESCA, which provide evidence for individualized prevention and treatment.© 2023.

Epigenetic dysregulation driven by adverse environmental factors has recently been documented in neurodevelopmental disorders as the possible etiological agent for their onset. However, most studies have focused on the epigenomes of the probands rather than on a possible epigenetic dysregulation arising in their mothers and influencing neurodevelopment during pregnancy. The aim of this research was to analyze the methylation profile of four well-known genes involved in neurodevelopment (BDNF,RELN,MTHFRandHTR1A) in the mothers of forty-five age-matched AS (Asperger Syndrome), ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) and typically developing children. We found a significant increase of methylation at the promoter of theRELNandHTR1Agenes in AS mothers compared to ADHD and healthy control mothers. For theMTHFRgene, promoter methylation was significantly higher in AS mothers compared to healthy control mothers only. The observed dysregulation in AS mothers could potentially contribute to the affected condition in their children deserving further investigation."

In order to address this issue, we have prepared a previously Co-Cr-enriched medium to further treat endothelial cells (HUVEC) for up to 72 h. Our data show there is important involvement with epigenetic machinery. Based on the data, it is believed that methylation balance in response to Co-Cr is finely modulated by DNMTs (DNA methyltransferases) and TETs (Tet methylcytosine dioxygenases), especially DNMT3B and both TET1 and TET2. Additionally, histone compaction HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6) seems to develop a significant effect in endothelial cells. The requirement of SIRT1 seems to have a crucial role in this scenario. SIRT1 is associated with a capacity to modulate the expression of HIF-1α in response to hypoxia microenvironments, thus presenting a protective effect. As mentioned previously, cobalt is able to prevent HIF1A degradation and maintain hypoxia-related signaling in eukaryotic cells. Together, our results show, for the first time, a descriptive study reporting the relevance of epigenetic machinery in endothelial cells responding to cobalt-chromium, and it opens new perspectives to better understand their repercussions as prerequisites for driving cell adhesion, cell cycle progression, and angiogenesis surrounding this Co-Cr-based implantable device."

In addition, they also often exhibit additional mutations targeting various pathways such as intracellular signalling, epigenetics, mRNA splicing or transcription. The natural history of myeloproliferative neoplasms is usually marked by a chronic phase of variable duration depending on the disease subtype, which can be followed by an accelerated phase or transformation towards more aggressive diseases such as myelofibrosis or acute leukemia. Besides, recent studies revealed important new information about the rates and mechanisms of sequential acquisition and selection of mutations in hematopoietic cells of myeloproliferative neoplasms. Better understanding of these events has been made possible in large part with the help of novel techniques that are now available to precisely decipher at the single cell level both the clonal architecture and the mutation-induced cell modifications. In this review, we will summarize the most recent knowledge about the mechanisms leading to clonal selection, how clonal architecture complexity can explain disease heterogeneity, and the impact of clonal evolution on clinical evolution.© 2023.

For most pinnipeds, current age estimation methodologies utilize tooth or bone sectioning which makes antemortem estimations problematic. We leveraged recent advances in the development of epigenetic age estimators (epigenetic clocks) to develop highly accurate pinniped epigenetic clocks. For clock development, we applied the mammalian methylation array to profile 37,492 cytosine-guanine sites (CpGs) across highly conserved stretches of DNA in blood and skin samples (n = 171) from primarily three pinniped species representing the three phylogenetic families: Otariidae, Phocidae and Odobenidae. We built an elastic net model with Leave-One-Out-Cross Validation (LOOCV) and one with a Leave-One-Species-Out-Cross-Validation (LOSOCV). After identifying the top 30 CpGs, the LOOCV produced a highly correlated (r = 0.95) and accurate (median absolute error = 1.7 years) age estimation clock. The LOSOCV elastic net results indicated that blood and skin clock (r = 0.84) and blood (r = 0.88) pinniped clocks could predict age of animals from pinniped species not used for clock development to within 3.6 and 4.4 years, respectively.

Establishing an etiologic diagnosis is crucial for disease management, prognostic evaluation, and provision of physical and psychological support for both the patient and the family. Advancements in genome sequencing have allowed rapid accumulation of gene-disorder associations and have accelerated the search for an etiologic diagnosis for unexplained GDD/ID. We reviewed recent studies that utilized genome-wide analysis technologies, and we discussed their diagnostic yield, strengths, and limitations. Overall, exome sequencing (ES) and genome sequencing (GS) outperformed chromosomal microarrays and targeted panel sequencing. GS provides coverage for both ES and chromosomal microarray regions, providing the maximal diagnostic potential, and the cost of ES and reanalysis of ES-negative results is currently still lower than that of GS alone. Therefore, singleton or trio ES is the more cost-effective option for the initial investigation of individuals with GDD/ID in clinical practice compared to a staged approach or GS alone. Based on these updated evidence, we proposed an evaluation algorithm with ES as the first-tier evaluation for unexplained GDD/ID."

One hundred and twenty adult female Baladi goats (sixty pneumonic and sixty apparently healthy) were used in this study. DNA and RNA were extracted from blood samples collected from the jugular vein of each goat.SLC11A1,CD-14,CCL2,TLR1,TLR7,TLR8,TLR9,β defensin,SP110,SPP1,BP1,A2M,ADORA3,CARD15,IRF3, andSCART1SNPs that have been previously found to be associated with pneumonia resistance/susceptibility were identified via PCR-DNA sequencing. The pneumonic and healthy goats differed significantly, according to a Chi-square analysis of the discovered SNPs. The mRNA levels of the studied immune markers were noticeably greater in the pneumonic goats than in the healthy ones. The findings could support the significance of the use of immune gene expression profiles and nucleotide variations as biomarkers for the susceptibility/resistance to pneumonia and provide a practical management technique for Baladi goats. These results also suggest a potential strategy for lowering pneumonia in goats by employing genetic markers linked to an animal's ability to fend off infection in selective breeding."

Here we generate self-organizing human pluripotent stem cell-derived epicardioids that display retinoic acid-dependent morphological, molecular and functional patterning of the epicardium and myocardium typical of the left ventricular wall. By combining lineage tracing, single-cell transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility profiling, we describe the specification and differentiation process of different cell lineages in epicardioids and draw comparisons to human fetal development at the transcriptional and morphological levels. We then use epicardioids to investigate the functional cross-talk between cardiac cell types, gaining new insights into the role of IGF2/IGF1R and NRP2 signaling in human cardiogenesis. Finally, we show that epicardioids mimic the multicellular pathogenesis of congenital or stress-induced hypertrophy and fibrotic remodeling. As such, epicardioids offer a unique testing ground of epicardial activity in heart development, disease and regeneration.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37007642","Cell-type-specific densities in mouse somatosensory cortex derived from scRNA-seq and in situ RNA hybridization.","Front Neuroanat","Cells in the mammalian cerebral cortex exhibit layer-dependent patterns in their distribution. Classical methods of determining cell type distributions typically employ a painstaking process of large-scale sampling and characterization of cellular composition. We found that by combiningin situhybridization (ISH) images with cell-type-specific transcriptomes, position-dependent cortical composition in P56 mouse could be estimated in the somatosensory cortex. The method uses ISH images from the Allen Institute for Brain Science. There are two novel aspects of the methodology. First, it is not necessary to select a subset of genes that are particular for a cell type of interest, nor is it necessary to only use ISH images with low variability among samples. Second, the method also compensated for differences in soma size and incompleteness of the transcriptomes. The soma size compensation is particularly important in order to obtain quantitative estimates since relying on bulk expression alone would overestimate the contribution of larger cells. Predicted distributions of broader classes of cell types agreed with literature distributions. The primary result is that there is a high degree of substructure in the distribution of transcriptomic types beyond the resolution of layers. Furthermore, transcriptomic cell types each exhibited characteristic soma size distributions. Results suggest that the method could also be employed to assign transcriptomic cell types to well-aligned image sets in the entire brain.Copyright © 2023 Keller, Verasztó and Markram."

Here we applied single-cell multi-omics analysis to delineate the gene regulatory profile of mouse corneal epithelial cells under normal homeostasis.Single cells isolated from the cornea epithelium (with marginal conjunctiva) of adult mice were subjected to scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq using the 10×Genomics platform. Cell types were clustered by the graph-based visualization method uniform manifold approximation and projection and unbiased computational informatics analysis. The scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq datasets were integrated following the integration pipeline described in ArchR and Seurat.We characterized diverse corneal epithelial cell types based on gene expression signatures and chromatin accessibility. We found that cell type-specific accessibility regions were mainly located at distal regions, suggesting essential roles of distal regulatory elements in determining corneal epithelial cell diversity. Trajectory analyses revealed a continuum of cell state transition and higher coordination between transcription factor (TF) motif accessibility and gene expression during corneal epithelial cell differentiation. By integrating transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility analysis, we identified cell type-specific and shared gene regulation programs. We also uncovered critical TFs driving corneal epithelial cell differentiation, such as nuclear factor I (NFI) family members, Rarg, Elf3. We found that nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) family members were positive TFs in limbal cells and some superficial cells, but they were involved in regulating distinct biological processes.Our study presents a comprehensive gene regulatory landscape of mouse cornea epithelial cells, and provides valuable foundations for future investigation of corneal epithelial homeostasis in the context of cornea pathologies and regenerative medicine."

Here, we find that the deubiquitinase UCHL3 is the direct target of farrerol. Mechanistically, farrerol enhanced the deubiquitinase activity of UCHL3 to promote RAD51 deubiquitination, thereby improving HR repair. Importantly, we find that embryos of somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) exhibited defective HR repair, increased genomic instability and aneuploidy, and that the farrerol treatment post nuclear transfer enhances HR repair, restores transcriptional and epigenetic network, and promotes SCNT embryo development. Ablating UCHL3 significantly attenuates farrerol-mediated stimulation in HR and SCNT embryo development. In summary, we identify farrerol as an activator of the deubiquitinase UCHL3, highlighted the importance of HR and epigenetic changes in SCNT reprogramming and provide a feasible method to promote SCNT efficiency.© 2023.

"36974063","Clinical Characterization of the Expression of Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 1 and Tumor Immunosuppression Caused by Ferroptosis of Neutrophils in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.","Int J Gen Med","The efficacy of immunotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is limited owing to cold tumors and drug resistance. Therefore, it is important to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying immune evasion in NSCLC. Spontaneous ferroptosis of neutrophils has been suggested as a key mechanism of immunosuppression in cancer. Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP1) plays an important role in immune infiltration in several cancers. However, the role of IGFBP1 in NSCLC is unknown. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the association ofIGFBP1mRNA expression with infiltration of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and prognosis in NSCLC.Retrospective RNA-seq data from 990 patients in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were analyzed in relation to patient clinical characteristics. The Timer2 database was used to assess immune infiltration, and the FerrDb V2 database was used to obtain ferroptosis-related genes. Finally, the results were validated by the proteomic analysis of serum samples collected from six patients with NSCLC and six healthy individuals.IGFBP1expression was enriched in lung adenocarcinoma samples and positively correlated with the pathological grade of NSCLC.IGFBP1expression was an independent prognostic factor for the overall survival of patients with NSCLC. In addition,IGFBP1expression correlated with myeloid-derived suppressor cell infiltration. Notably, Gene Ontology analysis ofIGFBP1-related genes revealed that the major molecular functions of their protein products were related to NADP+1-oxidoreductase activity. Furthermore, expression levels of multiple ferroptosis suppressor genes positively correlated withIGFBP1expression.HighIGFBP1expression indicates a poor prognosis in patients with NSCLC, which may be related to tumor immunosuppression caused by neutrophil ferroptosis.© 2023 Wang et al."

"36980826","Immunoepigenetic Regulation of Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Current Insights into Novel Epigenetic Modulations of the Systemic Immune Response.","Genes (Basel)","The immune system and environmental factors are involved in various diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), through their effect on genetics, which modulates immune cells. IBD encompasses two main phenotypes, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis, which are manifested as chronic and systemic relapse-remitting gastrointestinal tract disorders with rising global incidence and prevalence. The pathophysiology of IBD is complex and not fully understood. Epigenetic research has resulted in valuable information for unraveling the etiology of this immune-mediated disease. Thus, the main objective of the present review is to summarize the current findings on the role of epigenetic mechanisms in IBD to shed light on their potential clinical relevance. This review focuses on the latest evidence regarding peripheral blood mononuclear cells and epigenetic changes in histone modification, DNA methylation, and telomere shortening in IBD. The various identified epigenetic DNA profiles with clinical value in IBD could be used as biomarkers for more accurately predicting disease development, treatment response, and therapy-related adverse events. Ultimately, the information presented here could be of potential relevance for future clinical practice in developing more efficient and precise medicine to improve the quality of life for patients with IBD."

The optimal model was externally validated in an independent cohort from Shaanxi Provincial People's Hospital. Then we compare the performance of the optimal model and TNM staging system. Finally, we developed a Cloud-based recommendation system for adjuvant therapy to visualize survival curve of each treatment plan and deployed on the internet.A total of 4617 patients were included in this study. The deep learning network performed more stably and accurately in predicting stage-iii NSCLC resected patients survival than the random survival forest and Cox proportional hazard model on the internal test dataset (C-index=0.834 vs. 0.678 vs. 0.640) and better than TNM staging system (C-index=0.820 vs. 0.650) in the external validation. The individual patient who follow the reference from recommendation system had superior survival compared to those who did not. The predicted 5-year-survival curve for each adjuvant treatment plan could be accessed in the recommender systemviathe browser.Deep learning model has several advantages over linear model and random forest model in prognostic predication and treatment recommendations. This novel analytical approach may provide accurate predication on individual survival and treatment recommendations for resected Stage-iii NSCLC patients.Copyright © 2023 Jin, Zhao, Fu, Cao, Hou and Ma."
"36982759","Molecular Pathways of Carcinogenesis in Familial Adenomatous Polyposis.","Int J Mol Sci","Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a genetic syndrome characterized by the presence of multiple polyps in the gastrointestinal tract and a wide range of systemic extra-intestinal manifestations. Patients affected will inevitably undergo abdominal surgery due to the malignant transformation of one or more adenomas. The pathogenesis of the disease is based on a loss of function mutation in adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), a tumor-suppressor gene, inherited following a Mendelian pattern. This gene is a key component of multiple cell functions that cooperate for homeostasis; when mutated, it contributes to the progression of colorectal adenoma into cancer. Recent studies have demonstrated that several additional mechanisms may influence this process, such as alterations in gut microbiota composition and mucosal barrier immunity, interaction with the immune microenvironment and inflammation, the hormone estrogen, and other signaling pathways. These factors represent promising targets of future therapies and chemoprevention, aiming to alter the progressive nature of the disease and improve the quality of life of families affected. Therefore, we performed a narrative review about the current knowledge of the aforementioned pathways involved in colorectal cancer pathogenesis in FAP, exploring the genetic and environmental factors that may contribute to the development of CRC in FAP."
"36982453","Choosing the Right Cell Line for Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Research.","Int J Mol Sci","Immortalized cell lines are widely used in vitro tools in oncology and hematology research. While these cell lines represent artificial systems and may accumulate genetic aberrations with each passage, they are still considered valuable models for pilot, preliminary, and screening studies. Despite their limitations, cell lines are cost-effective and provide repeatable and comparable results. Choosing the appropriate cell line for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) research is crucial for obtaining reliable and relevant results. Several factors should be considered when selecting a cell line for AML research, such as specific markers and genetic abnormalities associated with different subtypes of AML. It is also essential to evaluate the karyotype and mutational profile of the cell line, as these can influence the behavior and response to the treatment of the cells. In this review, we evaluate immortalized AML cell lines and discuss the issues surrounding them concerning the revised World Health Organization and the French-American-British classifications."
"36828586","Characterization of network hierarchy reflects cell state specificity in genome organization.","Genome Res","Dynamic chromatin structure acts as the regulator of transcription program in crucial processes including cancer and cell development, but a unified framework for characterizing chromatin structural evolution remains to be established. Here, we performed graph inferences on Hi-C data sets and derived the chromatin contact networks. We discovered significant decreases in information transmission efficiencies in chromatin of colorectal cancer (CRC) and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) compared to corresponding normal controls through graph statistics. Using network embedding in the Poincaré disk, the hierarchy depths of chromatin from CRC and T-ALL patients were found to be significantly shallower compared to their normal controls. A reverse trend of change in chromatin structure was observed during early embryo development. We found tissue-specific conservation of hierarchy order in chromatin contact networks. Our findings reveal the top-down hierarchy of chromatin organization, which is significantly attenuated in cancer.© 2023 Wang et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press."
"36980513","The Sarcoma-Specific Instrument to Longitudinally Assess Health-Related Outcomes of the Routine Care Cycle.","Diagnostics (Basel)","Patient-based health related quality of life (HRQoL) measurements are associated with an improvement in quality of care and outcomes. For a complex disease such as sarcoma, there is no disease-specific questionnaire available which covers all clinically relevant dimensions. Herein, we report on the development of an electronically implemented, sarcoma-specific instrument to assess health-related outcomes, which encompasses a combination of generic questionnaires tailored to the respective disease and treatment status covering the entire longitudinal care cycle. An interoperable digital platform was designed to provide a node between patients and physicians and to integrate the sarcoma-specific HRQoL instrument with patient and physician-based quality indicators to allow longitudinal structured real-world-time data evidence analytics. This approach enables the prediction modeling of disease, and by attributing cost tags to quality indicators, treatment effectiveness for a given disease will be directly correlated with financial expenses, which may ultimately lead to a more sustainable healthcare system."
"36982706","Circadian Oscillations in Skin and Their Interconnection with the Cycle of Life.","Int J Mol Sci","Periodically oscillating biological processes, such as circadian rhythms, are carefully concerted events that are only beginning to be understood in the context of tissue pathology and organismal health, as well as the molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions. Recent reports indicate that light can independently entrain peripheral circadian clocks, challenging the currently prevalent hierarchical model. Despite the recent progress that has been made, a comprehensive overview of these periodic processes in skin is lacking in the literature. In this review, molecular circadian clock machinery and the factors that govern it have been highlighted. Circadian rhythm is closely linked to immunological processes and skin homeostasis, and its desynchrony can be linked to the perturbation of the skin. The interplay between circadian rhythm and annual, seasonal oscillations, as well as the impact of these periodic events on the skin, is described. Finally, the changes that occur in the skin over a lifespan are presented. This work encourages further research into the oscillating biological processes occurring in the skin and lays the foundation for future strategies to combat the adverse effects of desynchrony, which would likely have implications in other tissues influenced by periodic oscillatory processes."
