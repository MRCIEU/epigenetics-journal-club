,No,20230406,e-cigarettes,36989612,Flavored E-cigarette product aerosols induce transformation of human bronchial epithelial cells.,Lung Cancer,"E-cigarettes are the most commonly used nicotine containing products among youth. In vitro studies support the potential for e-cigarettes to cause cellular stress in vivo; however, there have been no studies to address whether exposure to e-liquid aerosols can induce cell transformation, a process strongly associated with pre-malignancy. We examined whether weekly exposure of human bronchial epithelial cell (HBEC) lines to e-cigarette aerosols would induce transformation and concomitant changes in gene expression and promoter hypermethylation.An aerosol delivery system exposed three HBEC lines to unflavored e-liquid with 1.2% nicotine, 3 flavored products with nicotine, or the Kentucky reference cigarette once a week for 12 weeks. Colony formation in soft agar, RNA-sequencing, and the EPIC Beadchip were used to evaluate transformation, genome-wide expression and methylation changes.Jamestown e-liquid aerosol induced transformation of HBEC2 and HBEC26, while unflavored and Blue Pucker transformed HBEC26. Cigarette smoke aerosol transformed HBEC4 and HBEC26 at efficiencies up to 3-fold greater than e-liquids. Transformed clones exhibited extensive reprogramming of the transcriptome with common and distinct gene expression changes observed between the cigarette and e-liquids. Transformation by e-liquids induced alterations in canonical pathways implicated in lung cancer that included axonal guidance and NRF2. Gene methylation, while prominent in cigarette-induced transformed clones, also affected hundreds of genes in HBEC2 transformed by Jamestown. Many genes with altered expression or epigenetic-mediated silencing were also affected in lung tumors from smokers.These studies show that exposure to e-liquid aerosols can induce a pre-malignant phenotype in lung epithelial cells. While the Food and Drug Administration banned the sale of flavored cartridge-based electric cigarettes, consumers switched to using flavored products through other devices. Our findings clearly support expanding studies to evaluate transformation potency for the major categories of e-liquid flavors to better inform risk from these complex mixtures.Copyright © 2023.

Sam,No,20230406,kidney,36989112,DNA-damaged podocyte-CD8 T cell crosstalk exacerbates kidney injury by altering DNA methylation.,Cell Rep,"Recent epigenome-wide studies suggest an association between blood DNA methylation and kidney function. However, the pathological importance remains unclear. Here, we show that the homing endonuclease I-PpoI-induced DNA double-strand breaks in kidney glomerular podocytes cause proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis with DNA methylation changes in blood cells as well as in podocytes. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis reveals an increase in cytotoxic CD8+T cells with the activating/costimulatory receptor NKG2D in the kidneys, which exhibit a memory precursor effector cell phenotype, and the CD44highmemory CD8+T cells are also increased in the peripheral circulation. NKG2D blockade attenuates the renal phenotype caused by podocyte DNA damage. Blood methylome shows increased DNA methylation in binding sites for STAT1, a transcription factor contributing to CD8+T cell homeostasis. Collectively, podocyte DNA damage alters the blood methylome, leading to changes in CD8+T cells, which contribute to sustained renal injury in chronic kidney disease.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

,Yes,20230406,ewas,36979655,Epigenome-Wide Association Studies of the Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide and Bronchodilator Drug Response in Moderate-to-Severe Pediatric Asthma.,Biomedicines,"Asthma is the most prevalent pediatric chronic disease. Bronchodilator drug response (BDR) and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) are clinical biomarkers of asthma. Although DNA methylation (DNAm) contributes to asthma pathogenesis, the influence of DNAm on BDR and FeNO is scarcely investigated. This study aims to identify DNAm markers in whole blood associated either with BDR or FeNO in pediatric asthma. We analyzed 121 samples from children with moderate-to-severe asthma. The association of genome-wide DNAm with BDR and FeNO has been assessed using regression models, adjusting for age, sex, ancestry, and tissue heterogeneity. Cross-tissue validation was assessed in 50 nasal samples. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and enrichment in traits and biological pathways were assessed. A false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.1 and a genome-wide significance threshold ofp< 9 × 10-8were used to control for false-positive results. The CpG cg12835256 (PLA2G12A) was genome-wide associated with FeNO in blood samples (coefficient= -0.015,p= 2.53 × 10-9) and nominally associated in nasal samples (coefficient = -0.015,p= 0.045). Additionally, three CpGs were suggestively associated with BDR (FDR < 0.1). We identified 12 and four DMRs associated with FeNO and BDR (FDR < 0.05), respectively. An enrichment in allergic and inflammatory processes, smoking, and aging was observed. We reported novel associations of DNAm markers associated with BDR and FeNO enriched in asthma-related processes."
Sarah,No,20230406,dnamage,36991505,Distinguishable DNA methylation defines a cardiac-specific epigenetic clock.,Clin Epigenetics,"The present study investigates whether epigenetic differences emerge in the heart of patients undergoing cardiac surgery for an aortic valvular replacement (AVR) or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). An algorithm is also established to determine how the pathophysiological condition might influence the human biological cardiac age.Blood samples and cardiac auricles were collected from patients who underwent cardiac procedures: 94 AVR and 289 CABG. The CpGs from three independent blood-derived biological clocks were selected to design a new blood- and the first cardiac-specific clocks. Specifically, 31 CpGs from six age-related genes, ELOVL2, EDARADD, ITGA2B, ASPA, PDE4C, and FHL2, were used to construct the tissue-tailored clocks. The best-fitting variables were combined to define new cardiac- and blood-tailored clocks validated through neural network analysis and elastic regression. In addition, telomere length (TL) was measured by qPCR. These new methods revealed a similarity between chronological and biological age in the blood and heart; the average TL was significantly higher in the heart than in the blood. In addition, the cardiac clock discriminated well between AVR and CABG and was sensitive to cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity and smoking. Moreover, the cardiac-specific clock identified an AVR patient's subgroup whose accelerated bioage correlated with the altered ventricular parameters, including left ventricular diastolic and systolic volume.This study reports on applying a method to evaluate the cardiac biological age revealing epigenetic features that separate subgroups of AVR and CABG.© 2023.

,No,20230406,dnamage,36945654,Mother's childhood adversity is associated with accelerated epigenetic aging in pregnancy and in male newborns.,bioRxiv,"Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are correlated with accelerated epigenetic aging, but it is not clear whether altered epigenetic aging from childhood adversities persists into adulthood and can be transmitted to the next generation. Thus, we tested whether mothers' childhood adversity is associated with accelerated epigenetic aging during pregnancy and in their newborn offspring.Data were from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) sub-study, Accessible Resource for Integrated Epigenomic Studies (ARIES). Women provided retrospective self-reports during pregnancy of ACE exposure. DNA methylation was measured in mothers during pregnancy and cord blood at birth. Estimates of epigenetic age acceleration were calculated using Principal Components of Horvath, Hannum skin & blood, GrimAge, PhenoAge, and DunedinPACE epigenetic clocks for mothers; and the Knight and Bohlin cord blood clocks for newborns. Associations between a cumulative maternal ACE score and epigenetic age acceleration were estimated using linear regression models, adjusting for maternal age at pregnancy, smoking during pregnancy, education, and pre-pregnancy BMI. Models for offspring were stratified by sex and additionally adjusted for gestation age.Mothers' total ACE score was positively associated with accelerated maternal PhenoAge and GrimAge. In newborn offspring, mothers' total ACE score was positively associated with accelerated epigenetic aging in males using the Bohlin clock, but not in females using either epigenetic clock. We found male offsprings' epigenetic age was accelerated in those born to mothers exposed to neglect using the Knight clock; and parental substance abuse using the Bohlin clock.Our results show that mothers' ACE exposure is associated with DNAm age acceleration in male offspring, supporting the notion that DNAm age could be a marker of intergenerational biological embedding of mothers' childhood adversity. This is consistent with findings on vulnerability of male fetuses to environmental insults."
,No,20230406,transgenerational epigenetic inheritance,36982962,Sperm RNA Payload: Implications for Intergenerational Epigenetic Inheritance.,Int J Mol Sci,"There is mounting evidence that ancestral life experiences and environment can influence phenotypes in descendants. The parental environment regulates offspring phenotypes potentially via modulating epigenetic marks in the gametes. Here, we review examples of across-generational inheritance of paternal environmental effects and the current understanding of the role of small RNAs in such inheritance. We discuss recent advances in revealing the small RNA payload of sperm and how environmental conditions modulate sperm small RNAs. Further, we discuss the potential mechanism of inheritance of paternal environmental effects by focusing on sperm small RNA-mediated regulation of early embryonic gene expression and its role in influencing offspring phenotypes."
Ryan,No,20230406,cell counts,36993280,Accurate estimation of rare cell type fractions from tissue omics data via hierarchical deconvolution.,bioRxiv,"Bulk transcriptomics in tissue samples reflects the average expression levels across different cell types and is highly influenced by cellular fractions. As such, it is critical to estimate cellular fractions to both deconfound differential expression analyses and infer cell type-specific differential expression. Since experimentally counting cells is infeasible in most tissues and studies,in silicocellular deconvolution methods have been developed as an alternative. However, existing methods are designed for tissues consisting of clearly distinguishable cell types and have difficulties estimating highly correlated or rare cell types. To address this challenge, we propose Hierarchical Deconvolution (HiDecon) that uses single-cell RNA sequencing references and a hierarchical cell type tree, which models the similarities among cell types and cell differentiation relationships, to estimate cellular fractions in bulk data. By coordinating cell fractions across layers of the hierarchical tree, cellular fraction information is passed up and down the tree, which helps correct estimation biases by pooling information across related cell types. The flexible hierarchical tree structure also enables estimating rare cell fractions by splitting the tree to higher resolutions. Through simulations and real data applications with the ground truth of measured cellular fractions, we demonstrate that HiDecon significantly outperforms existing methods and accurately estimates cellular fractions."
Scott;Neil,No,20230406,qtl,36991119,An atlas of genetic scores to predict multi-omic traits.,Nature,"The use of omic modalities to dissect the molecular underpinnings of common diseases and traits is becoming increasingly common. But multi-omic traits can be genetically predicted, which enables highly cost-effective and powerful analyses for studies that do not have multi-omics1. Here we examine a large cohort (the INTERVAL study2; n = 50,000 participants) with extensive multi-omic data for plasma proteomics (SomaScan, n = 3,175; Olink, n = 4,822), plasma metabolomics (Metabolon HD4, n = 8,153), serum metabolomics (Nightingale, n = 37,359) and whole-blood Illumina RNA sequencing (n = 4,136), and use machine learning to train genetic scores for 17,227 molecular traits, including 10,521 that reach Bonferroni-adjusted significance. We evaluate the performance of genetic scores through external validation across cohorts of individuals of European, Asian and African American ancestries. In addition, we show the utility of these multi-omic genetic scores by quantifying the genetic control of biological pathways and by generating a synthetic multi-omic dataset of the UK Biobank3to identify disease associations using a phenome-wide scan. We highlight a series of biological insights with regard to genetic mechanisms in metabolism and canonical pathway associations with disease; for example, JAK-STAT signalling and coronary atherosclerosis. Finally, we develop a portal ( https://www.omicspred.org/ ) to facilitate public access to all genetic scores and validation results, as well as to serve as a platform for future extensions and enhancements of multi-omic genetic scores.© 2023.

,No,20230406,circadian rhythm,36982706,Circadian Oscillations in Skin and Their Interconnection with the Cycle of Life.,Int J Mol Sci,"Periodically oscillating biological processes, such as circadian rhythms, are carefully concerted events that are only beginning to be understood in the context of tissue pathology and organismal health, as well as the molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions. Recent reports indicate that light can independently entrain peripheral circadian clocks, challenging the currently prevalent hierarchical model. Despite the recent progress that has been made, a comprehensive overview of these periodic processes in skin is lacking in the literature. In this review, molecular circadian clock machinery and the factors that govern it have been highlighted. Circadian rhythm is closely linked to immunological processes and skin homeostasis, and its desynchrony can be linked to the perturbation of the skin. The interplay between circadian rhythm and annual, seasonal oscillations, as well as the impact of these periodic events on the skin, is described. Finally, the changes that occur in the skin over a lifespan are presented. This work encourages further research into the oscillating biological processes occurring in the skin and lays the foundation for future strategies to combat the adverse effects of desynchrony, which would likely have implications in other tissues influenced by periodic oscillatory processes."
