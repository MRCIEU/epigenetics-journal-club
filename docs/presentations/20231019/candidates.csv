37650641,Widespread effects of DNA methylation and intra-motif dependencies revealed by novel transcription factor binding models.,Nucleic Acids Res,"Several studies suggested that transcription factor (TF) binding to DNA may be impaired or enhanced by DNA methylation. We present MeDeMo, a toolbox for TF motif analysis that combines information about DNA methylation with models capturing intra-motif dependencies. In a large-scale study using ChIP-seq data for 335 TFs, we identify novel TFs that show a binding behaviour associated with DNA methylation. Overall, we find that the presence of CpG methylation decreases the likelihood of binding for the majority of methylation-associated TFs. For a considerable subset of TFs, we show that intra-motif dependencies are pivotal for accurately modelling the impact of DNA methylation on TF binding. We illustrate that the novel methylation-aware TF binding models allow to predict differential ChIP-seq peaks and improve the genome-wide analysis of TF binding. Our work indicates that simplistic models that neglect the effect of DNA methylation on DNA binding may lead to systematic underperformance for methylation-associated TFs.© The Author(s) 2023.

37641110,Evaluation of the pooled sample method in Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip array by comparison with individual samples.,Clin Epigenetics,"The pooled sample method is used in epigenomic research and expression analysis and is a cost-effective screening approach for small amounts of DNA. Evaluation of the pooled sample method in epigenomic studies is performed using the Illumina Infinium Methylation 450K BeadChip array; however, subsequent reports on the updated 850K array are lacking. A previous study demonstrated that the methylation levels obtained from individual samples were accurately replicated using pooled samples but did not address epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) statistics. The DNA quantification method, which is important for the homogeneous mixing of DNA in the pooled sample method, has since become fluorescence-based, and additional factors need to be considered including the resolution of batch effects of microarray chips and the heterogeneity of the cellular proportions from which the DNA samples are derived. In this study, four pooled samples were created from 44 individual samples, and EWAS statistics for differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and regions (DMRs) were conducted for individual samples and compared with the statistics obtained from the pooled samples.The methylation levels could be reproduced fairly well in the pooled samples. This was the case for the entire dataset and when limited to the top 100 CpG sites, consistent with a previous study using the 450K BeadChip array. However, the statistical results of the EWAS for the DMP by individual samples were not replicated in pooled samples. Qualitative analyses highlighting methylation within an arbitrary candidate gene were replicable. Focusing on chr 20, the statistical results of EWAS for DMR from individual samples showed replicability in the pooled samples as long as they were limited to regions with a sufficient effect size.The pooled sample method replicated the methylation values well and can be used for EWAS in DMR. This method is sample amount-effective and cost-effective and can be utilized for screening by carefully understanding the effective features and disadvantages of the pooled sample method and combining it with candidate gene analyses.© 2023.

37634000,Objective and subjective measures of sleep initiation are differentially associated with DNA methylation in adolescents.,Clin Epigenetics,"The onset of puberty is associated with a shift in the circadian timing of sleep, leading to delayed sleep initiation [i.e., later sleep onset time (SOT)] due to later bedtimes and/or longer sleep onset latency (SOL). Several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified genes that may be involved in the etiology of sleep phenotypes. However, circadian rhythms are also epigenetically regulated; therefore, epigenetic biomarkers may provide insight into the physiology of the pubertal sleep onset shift and the pathophysiology of prolonged or delayed sleep initiation.The gene-wide analysis indicated differential methylation within or around 1818 unique genes across the sleep initiation measurements using self-report, actigraphy (ACT), and polysomnography (PSG), while GWAS-informed analysis yielded 67 genes. Gene hits were identified for bedtime (PSG), SOL (subjective, ACT and PSG) and SOT (subjective and PSG). DNA methylation within 12 genes was associated with both subjective and PSG-measured SOL, 31 with both ACT- and PSG-measured SOL, 19 with both subjective and ACT-measured SOL, and one gene (SMG1P2) had methylation sites associated with subjective, ACT- and PSG-measured SOL.Objective and subjective sleep initiation in adolescents is associated with altered DNA methylation in genes previously identified in adult GWAS of sleep and circadian phenotypes. Additionally, our data provide evidence for a potential epigenetic link between habitual (subjective and ACT) SOL and in-lab SOT and DNA methylation in and around genes involved in circadian regulation (i.e., RASD1, RAI1), cardiometabolic disorders (i.e., FADS1, WNK1, SLC5A6), and neuropsychiatric disorders (i.e., PRR7, SDK1, FAM172A). If validated, these sites may provide valuable targets for early detection and prevention of disorders involving prolonged or delayed SOT, such as insomnia, delayed sleep phase, and their comorbidity.© 2023.

37620312,Methylation across the central dogma in health and diseases: new therapeutic strategies.,Signal Transduct Target Ther,"The proper transfer of genetic information from DNA to RNA to protein is essential for cell-fate control, development, and health. Methylation of DNA, RNAs, histones, and non-histone proteins is a reversible post-synthesis modification that finetunes gene expression and function in diverse physiological processes. Aberrant methylation caused by genetic mutations or environmental stimuli promotes various diseases and accelerates aging, necessitating the development of therapies to correct the disease-driver methylation imbalance. In this Review, we summarize the operating system of methylation across the central dogma, which includes writers, erasers, readers, and reader-independent outputs. We then discuss how dysregulation of the system contributes to neurological disorders, cancer, and aging. Current small-molecule compounds that target the modifiers show modest success in certain cancers. The methylome-wide action and lack of specificity lead to undesirable biological effects and cytotoxicity, limiting their therapeutic application, especially for diseases with a monogenic cause or different directions of methylation changes. Emerging tools capable of site-specific methylation manipulation hold great promise to solve this dilemma. With the refinement of delivery vehicles, these new tools are well positioned to advance the basic research and clinical translation of the methylation field.© 2023.

37612641,"Maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, offspring epigenome-wide DNA methylation, and childhood obesity: findings from the Boston Birth Cohort.",BMC Med,"Maternal pre-pregnancy obesity is an established risk factor for childhood obesity. Investigating epigenetic alterations induced by maternal obesity during fetal development could gain mechanistic insight into the developmental origins of childhood obesity. While obesity disproportionately affects underrepresented racial and ethnic mothers and children in the USA, few studies investigated the role of prenatal epigenetic programming in intergenerational obesity of these high-risk populations.This study included 903 mother-child pairs from the Boston Birth Cohort, a predominantly urban, low-income minority birth cohort. Mother-infant dyads were enrolled at birth and the children were followed prospectively to age 18 years. Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip was used to measure epigenome-wide methylation level of cord blood. We performed an epigenome-wide association study of maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and cord blood DNA methylation (DNAm). To quantify the degree to which cord blood DNAm mediates the maternal BMI-childhood obesity, we further investigated whether maternal BMI-associated DNAm sites impact birthweight or childhood overweight or obesity (OWO) from age 1 to age 18 and performed corresponding mediation analyses.The study sample contained 52.8% maternal pre-pregnancy OWO and 63.2% offspring OWO at age 1-18 years. Maternal BMI was associated with cord blood DNAm at 8 CpG sites (genome-wide false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05). After accounting for the possible interplay of maternal BMI and smoking, 481 CpG sites were discovered for association with maternal BMI. Among them 123 CpGs were associated with childhood OWO, ranging from 42% decrease to 87% increase in OWO risk for each SD increase in DNAm. A total of 14 identified CpG sites showed a significant mediation effect on the maternal BMI-child OWO association (FDR < 0.05), with mediating proportion ranging from 3.99% to 25.21%. Several of these 14 CpGs were mapped to genes in association with energy balance and metabolism (AKAP7) and adulthood metabolic syndrome (CAMK2B).This prospective birth cohort study in a high-risk yet understudied US population found that maternal pre-pregnancy OWO significantly altered DNAm in newborn cord blood and provided suggestive evidence of epigenetic involvement in the intergenerational risk of obesity.© 2023.

37609313,Epigenome-wide association study of incident type 2 diabetes in Black and White participants from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study.,medRxiv,"DNA methylation studies of incident type 2 diabetes in US populations are limited, and to our knowledge none included individuals of African descent living in the US. We performed an epigenome-wide association analysis of blood-based methylation levels at CpG sites with incident type 2 diabetes using Cox regression in 2,091 Black and 1,029 White individuals from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study. At an epigenome-wide significance threshold of 10-7, we detected 7 novel diabetes-associated CpG sites inC1orf151(cg05380846: HR= 0.89,p= 8.4 × 10-12),ZNF2(cg01585592: HR= 0.88,p= 1.6 × 10-9),JPH3(cg16696007: HR= 0.87,p= 7.8 × 10-9),GPX6(cg02793507: HR= 0.85,p= 2.7 × 10-8and cg00647063: HR= 1.20,p= 2.5 × 10-8), chr17q25 (cg16865890: HR= 0.8,p= 6.9 × 10-8), and chr11p15 (cg13738793: HR= 1.11,p= 7.7 × 10-8). The CpG sites atC1orf151,ZNF2, JPH3andGPX6, were identified in Black adults, chr17q25 was identified in White adults, and chr11p15 was identified upon meta-analyzing the two groups. The CpG sites atJPH3andGPX6were likely associated with incident type 2 diabetes independent of BMI. All the CpG sites, except atJPH3, were likely consequences of elevated glucose at baseline. We additionally replicated known type 2 diabetes-associated CpG sites including cg19693031 atTXNIP, cg00574958 atCPT1A, cg16567056 atPLBC2, cg11024682 atSREBF1, cg08857797 atVPS25, and cg06500161 atABCG1, 3 of which were replicated in Black adults at the epigenome-wide threshold. We observed modest increase in type 2 diabetes variance explained upon addition of the significantly associated CpG sites to a Cox model that included traditional type 2 diabetes risk factors and fasting glucose (increase from 26.2% to 30.5% in Black adults; increase from 36.9% to 39.4% in White adults). We examined if groups of proximal CpG sites were associated with incident type 2 diabetes using a gene-region specific and a gene-region agnostic differentially methylated region (DMR) analysis. Our DMR analyses revealed several clusters of significant CpG sites, including a DMR consisting of a previously discovered CpG site atADCY7and promoter regions ofTP63which were differentially methylated across all race groups. This study illustrates improved discovery of CpG sites/regions by leveraging both individual CpG site and DMR analyses in an unexplored population. Our findings include genes linked to diabetes in experimental studies (e.g.,GPX6,JPH3,andTP63), and future gene-specific methylation studies could elucidate the link between genes, environment, and methylation in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes."
37608375,Sexually dimorphic methylation patterns characterize the placenta and blood from extremely preterm newborns.,BMC Biol,"Health outcomes among children born prematurely are known to be sexually dimorphic, with male infants often more affected, yet the mechanism behind this observation is not clear. CpG methylation levels in the placenta and blood also differ by sex and are associated with adverse health outcomes. We contrasted CpG methylation levels in the placenta and neonatal blood (n = 358) from the Extremely Low Gestational Age Newborn (ELGAN) cohort based on the EPIC array, which assays over 850,000 CpG sites across the epigenome. Sex-specific epigenome-wide association analyses were conducted for the placenta and neonatal blood samples independently, and the results were compared to determine tissue-specific differences between the methylation patterns in males and females. All models were adjusted for cell type heterogeneity. Enrichment pathway analysis was performed to identify the biological functions of genes related to the sexually dimorphic CpG sites.Approximately 11,500 CpG sites were differentially methylated in relation to sex. Of these, 5949 were placenta-specific and 5361 were blood-specific, with only 233 CpG sites overlapping in both tissues. For placenta-specific CpG sites, 90% were hypermethylated in males. For blood-specific CpG sites, 95% were hypermethylated in females. In the placenta, keratinocyte differentiation biological pathways were enriched among the differentially methylated genes. No enrichment pathways were observed for blood.Distinct methylation patterns were observed between male and female children born extremely premature, and keratinocyte differentiation pathways were enriched in the placenta. These findings provide new insights into the epigenetic mechanisms underlying sexually dimorphic health outcomes among extremely premature infants.© 2023.

37598461,Epigenome-wide DNA methylation association study of circulating IgE levels identifies novel targets for asthma.,EBioMedicine,"Identifying novel epigenetic signatures associated with serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) may improve our understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying asthma and IgE-mediated diseases.We performed an epigenome-wide association study using whole blood from Framingham Heart Study (FHS; n = 3,471, 46% females) participants and validated results using the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP; n = 674, 39% females) and the Genetic Epidemiology of Asthma in Costa Rica Study (CRA; n = 787, 41% females). Using the closest gene to each IgE-associated CpG, we highlighted biologically plausible pathways underlying IgE regulation and analyzed the transcription patterns linked to IgE-associated CpGs (expression quantitative trait methylation loci; eQTMs). Using prior UK Biobank summary data from genome-wide association studies of asthma and allergy, we performed Mendelian randomization (MR) for causal inference testing using the IgE-associated CpGs from FHS with methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTLs) as instrumental variables.We identified 490 statistically significant differentially methylated CpGs associated with IgE in FHS, of which 193 (39.3%) replicated in CAMP and CRA (FDR < 0.05). Gene ontology analysis revealed enrichment in pathways related to transcription factor binding, asthma, and other immunological processes. eQTM analysis identified 124 cis-eQTMs for 106 expressed genes (FDR < 0.05). MR in combination with drug-target analysis revealed CTSB and USP20 as putatively causal regulators of IgE levels (Bonferroni adjusted P < 7.94E-04) that can be explored as potential therapeutic targets.By integrating eQTM and MR analyses in general and clinical asthma populations, our findings provide a deeper understanding of the multidimensional inter-relations of DNA methylation, gene expression, and IgE levels.US NIH/NHLBI grants: P01HL132825, K99HL159234.

37589453,Epigenetic signature of human immune aging in the GESTALT study.,Elife,"Age-associated DNA methylation in blood cells convey information on health status. However, the mechanisms that drive these changes in circulating cells and their relationships to gene regulation are unknown. We identified age-associated DNA methylation sites in six purified blood borne immune cell types (naïve B, naïve CD4+and CD8+T cells, granulocytes, monocytes and NK cells) collected from healthy individuals interspersed over a wide age range. Of the thousands of age-associated sites, only 350 sites were differentially methylated in the same direction in all cell types and validated in an independent longitudinal cohort. Genes close to age-associated hypomethylated sites were enriched for collagen biosynthesis and complement cascade pathways, while genes close to hypermethylated sites mapped to neuronal pathways. In-silico analyses showed that in most cell types, the age-associated hypo- and hypermethylated sites were enriched for ARNT (HIF1β) and REST transcription factor motifs respectively, which are both master regulators of hypoxia response. To conclude, despite spatial heterogeneity, there is a commonality in the putative regulatory role with respect to transcription factor motifs and histone modifications at and around these sites. These features suggest that DNA methylation changes in healthy aging may be adaptive responses to fluctuations of oxygen availability."
37587247,"Epigenome-wide analysis identifies methylome profiles linked to obsessive-compulsive disorder, disease severity, and treatment response.",Mol Psychiatry,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent mental disorder affecting ~2-3% of the population. This disorder involves genetic and, possibly, epigenetic risk factors. The dynamic nature of epigenetics also presents a promising avenue for identifying biomarkers associated with symptom severity, clinical progression, and treatment response in OCD. We, therefore, conducted a comprehensive case-control investigation using Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip, encompassing 185 OCD patients and 199 controls recruited from two distinct sites in Germany. Rigorous clinical assessments were performed by trained raters employing the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-I). We performed a robust two-step epigenome-wide association study that led to the identification of 305 differentially methylated CpG positions. Next, we validated these findings by pinpointing the optimal set of CpGs that could effectively classify individuals into their respective groups. This approach identified a subset comprising 12 CpGs that overlapped with the 305 CpGs identified in our EWAS. These 12 CpGs are close to or in genes associated with the sweet-compulsive brain hypothesis which proposes that aberrant dopaminergic transmission in the striatum may impair insulin signaling sensitivity among OCD patients. We replicated three of the 12 CpGs signals from a recent independent study conducted on the Han Chinese population, underscoring also the cross-cultural relevance of our findings. In conclusion, our study further supports the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in the pathogenesis of OCD. By elucidating the underlying molecular alterations associated with OCD, our study contributes to advancing our understanding of this complex disorder and may ultimately improve clinical outcomes for affected individuals.© 2023.

37563670,Introduction of a multiplex amplicon sequencing assay to quantify DNA methylation in target cytosine markers underlying four selected epigenetic clocks,Clin Epigenetics,"DNA methylation analysis has proven to be a powerful tool for age assessment. However, the implementation of epigenetic age prediction in diagnostics or routine forensic casework requires appropriate laboratory methods. In this study, we aimed to compare the performance of large-scale DNA methylation analysis protocols that show promise in terms of accuracy, throughput, multiplexing capacity, and high sensitivity.The protocols were designed to target a predefined panel of 161 genomic CG/CA sites from four known estimators of epigenetic age-related parameters, optimized and validated using artificially methylated controls or blood samples. We successfully targeted 96% of these loci using two enrichment protocols: Ion AmpliSeq™, an amplicon-based method integrated with Ion Torrent S5, and SureSelectXTMethyl-Seq, a hybridization-based method followed by MiSeq FGx sequencing. Both protocols demonstrated high accuracy and robustness. Although hybridization assays have greater multiplexing capabilities, the best overall performance was observed for the amplicon-based protocol with the lowest variability in DNA methylation at 25 ng of starting DNA, mean observed marker coverage of ~ 6.7 k reads, and accuracy of methylation quantification with a mean absolute difference between observed and expected methylation beta value of 0.054. The Ion AmpliSeq method correlated strongly with genome-scale EPIC microarray data (R = 0.91) and showed superiority in terms of methylation measurement accuracy. Method-to-method bias was accounted for by the use of linear transformation, which provided a highly accurate prediction of calendar age with a mean absolute error of less than 5 years for the VISAGE and Hannum age clocks used. The pace of aging (PoAm) and the mortality risk score (MRS) estimators included in our panel represent next-generation clocks, were found to have low to moderate correlations with the VISAGE and Hannum models (R < 0.75), and thus may capture different aspects of epigenetic aging.We propose a laboratory tool that allows the quantification of DNA methylation in cytosines underlying four different clocks, thus providing broad information on epigenetic aging while maintaining a reasonable number of CpG markers, opening the way to a wide range of applications in forensics, medicine, and healthcare.© 2023.

37563237,Expression quantitative trait methylation analysis elucidates gene regulatory effects of DNA methylation: the Framingham Heart Study.,Sci Rep,"Expression quantitative trait methylation (eQTM) analysis identifies DNA CpG sites at which methylation is associated with gene expression. The present study describes an eQTM resource of CpG-transcript pairs derived from whole blood DNA methylation and RNA sequencing gene expression data in 2115 Framingham Heart Study participants. We identified 70,047 significant cis CpG-transcript pairs at p < 1E-7 where the top most significant eGenes (i.e., gene transcripts associated with a CpG) were enriched in biological pathways related to cell signaling, and for 1208 clinical traits (enrichment false discovery rate [FDR] ≤ 0.05). We also identified 246,667 significant trans CpG-transcript pairs at p < 1E-14 where the top most significant eGenes were enriched in biological pathways related to activation of the immune response, and for 1191 clinical traits (enrichment FDR ≤ 0.05). Independent and external replication of the top 1000 significant cis and trans CpG-transcript pairs was completed in the Women's Health Initiative and Jackson Heart Study cohorts. Using significant cis CpG-transcript pairs, we identified significant mediation of the association between CpG sites and cardiometabolic traits through gene expression and identified shared genetic regulation between CpGs and transcripts associated with cardiometabolic traits. In conclusion, we developed a robust and powerful resource of whole blood eQTM CpG-transcript pairs that can help inform future functional studies that seek to understand the molecular basis of disease.© 2023.

37500728,Single-molecule genome-wide mutation profiles of cell-free DNA for non-invasive detection of cancer,Nat Genet,"Somatic mutations are a hallmark of tumorigenesis and may be useful for non-invasive diagnosis of cancer. We analyzed whole-genome sequencing data from 2,511 individuals in the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) study as well as 489 individuals from four prospective cohorts and found distinct regional mutation type-specific frequencies in tissue and cell-free DNA from patients with cancer that were associated with replication timing and other chromatin features. A machine-learning model using genome-wide mutational profiles combined with other features and followed by CT imaging detected >90% of patients with lung cancer, including those with stage I and II disease. The fixed model was validated in an independent cohort, detected patients with cancer earlier than standard approaches and could be used to monitor response to therapy. This approach lays the groundwork for non-invasive cancer detection using genome-wide mutation features that may facilitate cancer screening and monitoring."
37630812,Plasma One-Carbon Metabolism-Related Micronutrients and the Risk of Breast Cancer: Involvement of DNA Methylation.,Nutrients,"Findings of epidemiologic studies focusing on the association between one-carbon metabolism-related micronutrients and breast cancer risk, along with the involvement of DNA methylation, have been inconsistent and incomprehensive. We conducted a case-control study in China including 107 paired participants and comprehensively detected 12 plasma one-carbon metabolism-related micronutrients. Genomic DNA methylation was measured using an 850 K chip and differential methylation probes (DMPs) were identified. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to estimate the associations between plasma micronutrients and the odds of breast cancer. The mediation of selected DMPs in micronutrient breast cancer associations was examined using mediation analyses. An inverse association of plasma folate, methionine cycling-related micronutrients (methionine, S-adenosylmethionine, and S-adenosylhomocysteine), and all micronutrients in the choline metabolism and enzymatic factor groups, and a positive association of methionine cycling-related cysteine with breast cancer risk were observed. Nine micronutrients (methionine, cysteine, SAM, folate, choline, betaine, P5P, vitamins B2, and B12) were related to global or probe-specific methylation levels (p< 0.05). The selected DMPs mediated the micronutrient breast cancer associations with an average mediation proportion of 36.43%. This study depicted comprehensive associations between circulating one-carbon metabolism-related micronutrients and breast cancer risk mediated by DNA methylation."
37597113,Insights into ageing rates comparison across tissues from recalibrating cerebellum DNA methylation clock.,Geroscience,"DNA methylation (DNAm)-based age clocks have been studied extensively as a biomarker of human ageing and a risk factor for age-related diseases. Despite different tissues having vastly different rates of proliferation, it is still largely unknown whether they age at different rates. It was previously reported that the cerebellum ages slowly; however, this claim was drawn from a single clock using a relatively small sample size and so warrants further investigation. We collected the largest cerebellum DNAm dataset (N = 752) to date. We found the respective epigenetic ages are all severely underestimated by six representative DNAm age clocks, with the underestimation effects more pronounced in the four clocks whose training datasets do not include brain-related tissues. We identified 613 age-associated CpGs in the cerebellum, which accounts for only 14.5% of the number found in the middle temporal gyrus from the same population (N = 404). From the 613 cerebellum age-associated CpGs, we built a highly accurate age prediction model for the cerebellum named CerebellumClockspecific(Pearson correlation=0.941, MAD=3.18 years). Ageing rate comparisons based on the two tissue-specific clocks constructed on the 201 overlapping age-associated CpGs support the cerebellum has younger DNAm age. Nevertheless, we built BrainCortexClock to prove a single DNAm clock is able to unbiasedly estimate DNAm ages of both cerebellum and cerebral cortex, when they are adequately and equally represented in the training dataset. Comparing ageing rates across tissues using DNA methylation multi-tissue clocks is flawed. The large underestimation of age prediction for cerebellums by previous clocks mainly reflects the improper usage of these age clocks. There exist strong and consistent ageing effects on the cerebellar methylome, and we suggest the smaller number of age-associated CpG sites in cerebellum is largely attributed to its extremely low average cell replication rates.© 2023.

37609328,Reversal of Biological Age in Multiple Rat Organs by Young Porcine Plasma Fraction,bioRxiv,"Young blood plasma is known to confer beneficial effects on various organs in mice and rats. However, it was not known whether plasma from young pigs rejuvenates old rat tissues at the epigenetic level; whether it alters the epigenetic clock, which is a highly accurate molecular biomarker of aging. To address this question, we developed and validated six different epigenetic clocks for rat tissues that are based on DNA methylation values derived from n=613 tissue samples. As indicated by their respective names, the rat pan-tissue clock can be applied to DNA methylation profiles from all rat tissues, while the rat brain-, liver-, and blood clocks apply to the corresponding tissue types. We also developed two epigenetic clocks that apply to both human and rat tissues by adding n=1366 human tissue samples to the training data. We employed these six rat clocks to investigate the rejuvenation effects of a porcine plasma fraction treatment in different rat tissues. The treatment more than halved the epigenetic ages of blood, heart, and liver tissue. A less pronounced, but statistically significant, rejuvenation effect could be observed in the hypothalamus. The treatment was accompanied by progressive improvement in the function of these organs as ascertained through numerous biochemical/physiological biomarkers and behavioral responses to assess cognitive functions. An immunoglobulin G (IgG) N-glycosylation pattern shift from pro-to anti-inflammatory also indicated reversal of glycan aging. Overall, this study demonstrates that a young porcine plasma-derived treatment markedly reverses aging in rats according to epigenetic clocks, IgG glycans, and other biomarkers of aging."
37576443,Psychological Stress and Epigenetic Aging in Older Men: The VA Normative Aging Study.,Transl Med Aging,"Psychological stress remains an important risk factor for morbidity and mortality throughout the life course. However, there have been counterintuitive findings reported in previous studies of older persons that examine the relationships of perceived psychological stress with DNA methylation-based markers of aging, which also serve as predictors of morbidity and mortality (epigenetic age/clocks). We aimed to replicate and expand findings from existing work by examining relationships of self-reported stress with nine epigenetic clocks: Hannum, Horvath, Intrinsic, Extrinsic, SkinBloodClock, PhenoAge, GrimAge, DNAm Telomere Length, and Pace of Aging. We analyzed data from 607 male participants (mean age 73.2 years) of the VA Normative Aging Study with one to two study visits from 1999 to 2007 (observations = 956). Stress was assessed via the 14-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Epigenetic age was calculated from DNA methylation measured in leukocytes with the HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. In linear mixed effects models adjusted for demographic/lifestyle/health factors, a standard deviation (sd) increase in PSS was associated with Horvath (β = -0.35-years, 95%CI: -0.61, -0.09,P=0.008) and Intrinsic (β = -0.40-years, 95%CI: -0.67, -0.13,P=0.004) epigenetic age deceleration. However, in models limited to participants with the highest levels of stress (≥ 75th-percentile), Horvath (β = 2.29-years, 95%CI: 0.16, 4.41,P=0.04) and Intrinsic (β = 2.06-years, 95%CI: -0.17, 4.28,P=0.07) age acceleration associations were observed. Our results reinforce the complexity of psychological stress and epigenetic aging relationships and lay a foundation for future studies that explore longitudinal relationships with other adult stress metrics and factors that can influence stress such as resilience measures."
37564905,Epigenetic clocks and research implications of the lack of data on whom they have been developed: a review of reported and missing sociodemographic characteristics,Environ Epigenet,"Epigenetic clocks are increasingly being used as a tool to assess the impact of a wide variety of phenotypes and exposures on healthy ageing, with a recent focus on social determinants of health. However, little attention has been paid to the sociodemographic characteristics of participants on whom these clocks have been based. Participant characteristics are important because sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors are known to be associated with both DNA methylation variation and healthy ageing. It is also well known that machine learning algorithms have the potential to exacerbate health inequities through the use of unrepresentative samples - prediction models may underperform in social groups that were poorly represented in the training data used to construct the model. To address this gap in the literature, we conducted a review of the sociodemographic characteristics of the participants whose data were used to construct 13 commonly used epigenetic clocks. We found that although some of the epigenetic clocks were created utilizing data provided by individuals from different ages, sexes/genders, and racialized groups, sociodemographic characteristics are generally poorly reported. Reported information is limited by inadequate conceptualization of the social dimensions and exposure implications of gender and racialized inequality, and socioeconomic data are infrequently reported. It is important for future work to ensure clear reporting of tangible data on the sociodemographic and socioeconomic characteristics of all the participants in the study to ensure that other researchers can make informed judgements about the appropriateness of the model for their study population.© The Author(s) 2023.

37563227,Universal DNA methylation age across mammalian tissues,Nat Aging,"Aging, often considered a result of random cellular damage, can be accurately estimated using DNA methylation profiles, the foundation of pan-tissue epigenetic clocks. Here, we demonstrate the development of universal pan-mammalian clocks, using 11,754 methylation arrays from our Mammalian Methylation Consortium, which encompass 59 tissue types across 185 mammalian species. These predictive models estimate mammalian tissue age with high accuracy (r > 0.96). Age deviations correlate with human mortality risk, mouse somatotropic axis mutations and caloric restriction. We identified specific cytosines with methylation levels that change with age across numerous species. These sites, highly enriched in polycomb repressive complex 2-binding locations, are near genes implicated in mammalian development, cancer, obesity and longevity. Our findings offer new evidence suggesting that aging is evolutionarily conserved and intertwined with developmental processes across all mammals.© 2023. The Author(s)."
37660134,Epigenetic inheritance is unfaithful at intermediately methylated CpG sites.,Nat Commun,"DNA methylation at the CpG dinucleotide is considered a stable epigenetic mark due to its presumed long-term inheritance through clonal expansion. Here, we perform high-throughput bisulfite sequencing on clonally derived somatic cell lines to quantitatively measure methylation inheritance at the nucleotide level. We find that although DNA methylation is generally faithfully maintained at hypo- and hypermethylated sites, this is not the case at intermediately methylated CpGs. Low fidelity intermediate methylation is interspersed throughout the genome and within genes with no or low transcriptional activity, and is not coordinately maintained between neighbouring sites. We determine that the probabilistic changes that occur at intermediately methylated sites are likely due to DNMT1 rather than DNMT3A/3B activity. The observed lack of clonal inheritance at intermediately methylated sites challenges the current epigenetic inheritance model and has direct implications for both the functional relevance and general interpretability of DNA methylation as a stable epigenetic mark.© 2023.

37576279,Intrinsic and environmental basis of aging: A narrative review,Heliyon,"Longevity has been a topic of interest since the beginnings of humanity, yet its aetiology and precise mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Aging is currently viewed as a physiological phenomenon characterized by the gradual degeneration of organic physiology and morphology due to the passage of time where both external and internal stimuli intervene. The influence of intrinsic factors, such as progressive telomere shortening, genome instability due to mutation buildup, the direct or indirect actions of age-related genes, and marked changes in epigenetic, metabolic, and mitochondrial patterns constitute a big part of its underlying endogenous mechanisms. On the other hand, several psychosocial and demographic factors, such as diet, physical activity, smoking, and drinking habits, may have an even more significant impact on shaping the aging process. Consequentially, implementing dietary and exercise patterns has been proposed as the most viable alternative strategy for attenuating the most typical degenerative aging changes, thus increasing the likelihood of prolonging lifespan and achieving successful aging.© 2023 The Authors."
37563310,Genetics of circulating inflammatory proteins identifies drivers of immune-mediated disease risk and therapeutic targets,Nat Immunol,"Circulating proteins have important functions in inflammation and a broad range of diseases. To identify genetic influences on inflammation-related proteins, we conducted a genome-wide protein quantitative trait locus (pQTL) study of 91 plasma proteins measured using the Olink Target platform in 14,824 participants. We identified 180 pQTLs (59 cis, 121 trans). Integration of pQTL data with eQTL and disease genome-wide association studies provided insight into pathogenesis, implicating lymphotoxin-α in multiple sclerosis. Using Mendelian randomization (MR) to assess causality in disease etiology, we identified both shared and distinct effects of specific proteins across immune-mediated diseases, including directionally discordant effects of CD40 on risk of rheumatoid arthritis versus multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowel disease. MR implicated CXCL5 in the etiology of ulcerative colitis (UC) and we show elevated gut CXCL5 transcript expression in patients with UC. These results identify targets of existing drugs and provide a powerful resource to facilitate future drug target prioritization.© 2023. The Author(s)."
37620370,Major depressive disorder.,Nat Rev Dis Primers,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by persistent depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure in previously enjoyable activities, recurrent thoughts of death, and physical and cognitive symptoms. People with MDD can have reduced quality of life owing to the disorder itself as well as related medical comorbidities, social factors, and impaired functional outcomes. MDD is a complex disorder that cannot be fully explained by any one single established biological or environmental pathway. Instead, MDD seems to be caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, psychological and biological factors. Treatment for MDD commonly involves pharmacological therapy with antidepressant medications, psychotherapy or a combination of both. In people with severe and/or treatment-resistant MDD, other biological therapies, such as electroconvulsive therapy, may also be offered.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."
37587191,Global endometrial DNA methylation analysis reveals insights into mQTL regulation and associated endometriosis disease risk and endometrial function,Commun Biol,"Endometriosis is a leading cause of pain and infertility affecting millions of women globally. Herein, we characterize variation in DNA methylation (DNAm) and its association with menstrual cycle phase, endometriosis, and genetic variants through analysis of genotype data and methylation in endometrial samples from 984 deeply-phenotyped participants. We estimate that 15.4% of the variation in endometriosis is captured by DNAm and identify significant differences in DNAm profiles associated with stage III/IV endometriosis, endometriosis sub-phenotypes and menstrual cycle phase, including opening of the window for embryo implantation. Menstrual cycle phase was a major source of DNAm variation suggesting cellular and hormonally-driven changes across the cycle can regulate genes and pathways responsible for endometrial physiology and function. DNAm quantitative trait locus (mQTL) analysis identified 118,185 independent cis-mQTLs including 51 associated with risk of endometriosis, highlighting candidate genes contributing to disease risk. Our work provides functional evidence for epigenetic targets contributing to endometriosis risk and pathogenesis. Data generated serve as a valuable resource for understanding tissue-specific effects of methylation on endometrial biology in health and disease.© 2023. The Author(s)."
37604891,Genetic analysis of blood molecular phenotypes reveals common properties in the regulatory networks affecting complex traits,Nat Commun,"We evaluate the shared genetic regulation of mRNA molecules, proteins and metabolites derived from whole blood from 3029 human donors. We find abundant allelic heterogeneity, where multiple variants regulate a particular molecular phenotype, and pleiotropy, where a single variant associates with multiple molecular phenotypes over multiple genomic regions. The highest proportion of share genetic regulation is detected between gene expression and proteins (66.6%), with a further median shared genetic associations across 49 different tissues of 78.3% and 62.4% between plasma proteins and gene expression. We represent the genetic and molecular associations in networks including 2828 known GWAS variants, showing that GWAS variants are more often connected to gene expression in trans than other molecular phenotypes in the network. Our work provides a roadmap to understanding molecular networks and deriving the underlying mechanism of action of GWAS variants using different molecular phenotypes in an accessible tissue.© 2023.

37626340,The inactive X chromosome accumulates widespread epigenetic variability with age.,Clin Epigenetics,"Loss of epigenetic control is a hallmark of aging. Among the most prominent roles of epigenetic mechanisms is the inactivation of one of two copies of the X chromosome in females through DNA methylation. Hence, age-related disruption of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) may contribute to the aging process in women.We analyzed 9,777 CpGs on the X chromosome in whole blood samples from 2343 females and 1688 males (Illumina 450k methylation array) and replicated findings in duplicate using one whole blood and one purified monocyte data set (in total, 991/924 females/males). We used double generalized linear models to detect age-related differentially methylated CpGs (aDMCs), whose mean methylation level differs with age, and age-related variably methylated CpGs (aVMCs), whose methylation level becomes more variable with age.In females, aDMCs were relatively uncommon (n = 33) and preferentially occurred in regions known to escape XCI. In contrast, many CpGs (n = 987) were found to display an increased variance with age (aVMCs). Of note, the replication rate of aVMCs was also high in purified monocytes (94%), indicating an independence of cell composition. aVMCs accumulated in CpG islands and regions subject to XCI suggesting that they stemmed from the inactive X. In males, carrying an active copy of the X chromosome only, aDMCs (n = 316) were primarily driven by cell composition, while aVMCs replicated well (95%) but were infrequent (n = 37).Our results imply that age-related DNA methylation differences at the inactive X chromosome are dominated by the accumulation of variability.© 2023.

37596607,Association between acetaminophen metabolites and CYP2E1 DNA methylation level in neonate cord blood in the Boston Birth Cohort.,Clin Epigenetics,"Acetaminophen is a commonly used medication by pregnant women and is known to cross the placenta. However, little is known about the biological mechanisms that regulate acetaminophen in the developing offspring. Cytochrome 2E1 (CYP2E1) is the primary enzyme responsible for the conversion of acetaminophen to its toxic metabolite. Ex vivo studies have shown that the CYP2E1 gene expression in human fetal liver and placenta is largely controlled by DNA methylation (DNAm) at CpG sites located in the gene body of CYP2E1 at the 5' end. To date, no population studies have examined the association between acetaminophen metabolite and fetal DNAm of CYP2E1 at birth.We utilized data from the Boston Birth Cohort (BBC) which represents an urban, low-income, racially and ethnically diverse population in Boston, Massachusetts. Acetaminophen metabolites were measured in the cord plasma of newborns enrolled in BBC between 2003 and 2013 using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. DNAm at 28 CpG sites of CYP2E1 was measured by Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. We used linear regression to identify differentially methylated CpG sites and the ""DiffVar"" method to identify differences in methylation variation associated with the detection of acetaminophen, adjusting for cell heterogeneity and batch effects. The false discovery rate (FDR) was calculated to account for multiple comparisons.Among the 570 newborns included in this study, 96 (17%) had detectable acetaminophen in cord plasma. We identified 7 differentially methylated CpGs (FDR < 0.05) associated with the detection of acetaminophen and additional 4 CpGs showing a difference in the variation of methylation (FDR < 0.05). These CpGs were all located in the gene body of CYP2E1 at the 5' end and had a 3-6% lower average methylation level among participants with detectable acetaminophen compared to participants without. The CpG sites we identified overlap with previously identified DNase hypersensitivity and open chromatin regions in the ENCODE project, suggesting potential regulatory functions.In a US birth cohort, we found detection of cord biomarkers of acetaminophen was associated with DNAm level of CYP2E1 in cord blood. Our findings suggest that DNA methylation of CYP2E1 may be an important regulator of acetaminophen levels in newborns.© 2023. BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature."
37653343,Sex differences in brain protein expression and disease.,Nat Med,"Most complex human traits differ by sex, but we have limited insight into the underlying mechanisms. Here, we investigated the influence of biological sex on protein expression and its genetic regulation in 1,277 human brain proteomes. We found that 13.2% (1,354) of brain proteins had sex-differentiated abundance and 1.5% (150) of proteins had sex-biased protein quantitative trait loci (sb-pQTLs). Among genes with sex-biased expression, we found 67% concordance between sex-differentiated protein and transcript levels; however, sex effects on the genetic regulation of expression were more evident at the protein level. Considering 24 psychiatric, neurologic and brain morphologic traits, we found that an average of 25% of their putatively causal genes had sex-differentiated protein abundance and 12 putatively causal proteins had sb-pQTLs. Furthermore, integrating sex-specific pQTLs with sex-stratified genome-wide association studies of six psychiatric and neurologic conditions, we uncovered another 23 proteins contributing to these traits in one sex but not the other. Together, these findings begin to provide insights into mechanisms underlying sex differences in brain protein expression and disease.© 2023.

37546907,"Equitable machine learning counteracts ancestral bias in precision medicine, improving outcomes for all.",Res Sq,"Gold standard genomic datasets severely under-represent non-European populations, leading to inequities and a limited understanding of human disease [1-8]. Therapeutics and outcomes remain hidden because we lack insights that we could gain from analyzing ancestry-unbiased genomic data. To address this significant gap, we present PhyloFrame, the first-ever machine learning method for equitable genomic precision medicine. PhyloFrame corrects for ancestral bias by integrating big data tissue-specific functional interaction networks, global population variation data, and disease-relevant transcriptomic data. Application of PhyloFrame to breast, thyroid, and uterine cancers shows marked improvements in predictive power across all ancestries, less model overfitting, and a higher likelihood of identifying known cancer-related genes. The ability to provide accurate predictions for underrepresented groups, in particular, is substantially increased. These results demonstrate how AI can mitigate ancestral bias in training data and contribute to equitable representation in medical research."
37628696,Polymorphisms in Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Genes Modify the Effect of Exposure to Maternal Smoking Metabolites in Pregnancy and Offspring DNA Methylation.,Genes (Basel),"Maternal smoking in pregnancy (MSP) affects the offspring's DNA methylation (DNAm). There is a lack of knowledge regarding individual differences in susceptibility to exposure to MSP. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) genes are involved in protection against harmful oxidants such as those found in cigarette smoke. This study aimed to test whether polymorphisms inGSTgenes influence the effect of MSP on offspring DNAm. Using data from the Isle of Wight birth cohort, we assessed the association of MSP and offspring DNAm in 493 mother-child dyads (251 male, 242 female) with the effect-modifying role ofGSTgene polymorphism (at rs506008, rs574344, rs12736389, rs3768490, rs1537234, and rs1695). MSP was assessed by levels of nicotine and its downstream metabolites (cotinine, norcotinine, and hydroxycotinine) in maternal sera. In males, associations of hydroxycotinine with DNAm at cg18473733, cg25949550, cg11647108, and cg01952185 and norcotinine with DNAm at cg09935388 were modified byGSTgene polymorphisms (p-values < 0.05). In females, associations of hydroxycotinine with DNAm at cg12160087 and norcotinine with DNAm at cg18473733 were modified byGSTgene polymorphisms (p-values < 0.05). Our study emphasizes the role of genetic polymorphism inGSTgenes in DNAm's susceptibility to MSP."
