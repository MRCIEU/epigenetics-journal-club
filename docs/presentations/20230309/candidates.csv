"36879646","Activation of hypermethylated P2RY1 mitigates gastric cancer by promoting apoptosis and inhibiting proliferation.","Open Life Sci","The P2RY1 receptor is known to cause cancer by activating the ERK signal pathway, and its DNA methylation status and corresponding regulatory mechanism remain unknown. This study used the DNA methylation chip to profile the genome-wide DNA methylation level in gastric cancer tissues. The proliferation and apoptosis of the SGC7901 gastric cancer cell line were determined after treatment with a selective P2RY1 receptor agonist, MRS2365. The promoter region of P2RY1 was found to be highly methylated with four hypermethylated sites (|Δβvalue| > 0.2) in diffuse gastric cancer and was validated by bioinformatics analysis in the TCGA database. Also, immunohistochemical staining data obtained from the HPA database demonstrated the downregulated expression of proteins encoded by P2RY1 in stomach cancer tissue. The analysis of MRS2365-treated cells by annexin V/propidium iodide staining and caspase-3 activity assays indicated the induction of apoptosis in SGC7901 cells. The P2RY1 receptor activation in human SGC7901 gastric cancer cells via the MRS2365 agonist induced apoptosis and reduced cell growth. High DNA methylation in the promoter region of P2RY1 might have contributed to the reduced expression of P2RY1's mRNA, which was likely responsible for the ""aggressive"" nature of the diffuse gastric cancer.© 2023 Yinggang Hua et al., published by De Gruyter."
"36876850","Pig fetal skeletal muscle development is associated with genome-wide DNA hypomethylation and corresponding alterations in transcript and microRNA expression.","Genome","Fetal myogenesis represents a critical period of porcine skeletal muscle development and requires coordinated expression of thousands of genes. Epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, drive transcriptional regulation during development; however, these processes are understudied in developing porcine tissues. We performed bisulfite sequencing to assess DNA methylation in piglongissimus dorsimuscle at 41- and 70-days gestation (dg), as well as RNA- and small RNA-sequencing to identify coordinated changes in methylation and expression between myogenic stages. We identified 45 739 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between stages, and the majority (N = 34 232) were hypomethylated at 70 versus 41 dg. Integration of methylation and transcriptomic data revealed strong associations between differential gene methylation and expression. Differential miRNA methylation was significantly negatively correlated with abundance, and dynamic expression of assayed miRNAs persisted postnatally. Motif analysis revealed significant enrichment of myogenic regulatory factor motifs among hypomethylated regions, suggesting that DNA hypomethylation may function to increase accessibility of muscle-specific transcription factors. We show that developmental DMRs are enriched for GWAS SNPs for muscle- and meat-related traits, demonstrating the potential for epigenetic processes to influence phenotypic diversity. Our results enhance understanding of DNA methylation dynamics of porcine myogenesis and reveal putativecis-regulatory elements governed by epigenetic processes."

Hypothermia, a commonly used treatment for traumatic brain injury, plays a neuroprotective role by altering m6A modifications. In this study, methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-Seq) was applied to conduct a genome-wide analysis of RNA m6A methylation in the rat hippocampus of Sham and traumatic brain injury (TBI) groups. In addition, we identified the expression of mRNA in the rat hippocampus after TBI with hypothermia treatment. Compared with the Sham group, the sequencing results of the TBI group showed that 951 different m6A peaks and 1226 differentially expressed mRNAs were found. We performed cross-linking analysis of the data of the two groups. The result showed that 92 hyper-methylated genes were upregulated, 13 hyper-methylated genes were downregulated, 25 hypo-methylated genes were upregulated, and 10 hypo-methylated genes were downregulated. Moreover, a total of 758 differential peaks were identified between TBI and hypothermia treatment groups. Among these differential peaks, 173 peaks were altered by TBI and reversed by hypothermia treatment, including Plat, Pdcd5, Rnd3, Sirt1, Plaur, Runx1, Ccr1, Marveld1, Lmnb2, and Chd7. We found that hypothermia treatment transformed some aspects of the TBI-induced m6A methylation landscape of the rat hippocampus.Copyright © 2023 Cheng, Lin, Yu, Zhu, Ma and Zhao."

To facilitate these tasks, we augmented our recountmethylation R/Bioconductor package with 12 537 uniformly processed EPIC and HM450K blood samples on GEO as well as several new features. We subsequently used our updated package in several illustrative analyses, finding (i) study ID bias adjustment increased variation explained by biological and demographic variables, (ii) most variation in autosomal DNAm was explained by genetic ancestry and CD4+ T-cell fractions and (iii) the dependence of power to detect differential methylation on sample size was similar for each of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), whole blood and umbilical cord blood.

"36873949","The impact of alcoholic drinks and dietary factors on epigenetic markers associated with triglyceride levels.","Front Genet","Background:Many epigenetic loci have been associated with plasma triglyceride (TG) levels, but epigenetic connections between those loci and dietary exposures are largely unknown. This study aimed to characterize the epigenetic links between diet, lifestyle, and TG.Methods:We first conducted an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) for TG in the Framingham Heart Study Offspring population (FHS,n= 2,264). We then examined relationships between dietary and lifestyle-related variables, collected four times in 13 years, and differential DNA methylation sites (DMSs) associated with the last TG measures. Third, we conducted a mediation analysis to evaluate the causal relationships between diet-related variables and TG. Finally, we replicated three steps to validate identified DMSs associated with alcohol and carbohydrate intake in the Genetics of Lipid-Lowering Drugs and Diet Network (GOLDN) study (n= 993).Results:In the FHS, the EWAS revealed 28 TG-associated DMSs at 19 gene regions. We identified 102 unique associations between these DMSs and one or more dietary and lifestyle-related variables. Alcohol and carbohydrate intake showed the most significant and consistent associations with 11 TG-associated DMSs. Mediation analyses demonstrated that alcohol and carbohydrate intake independently affect TGviaDMSs as mediators. Higher alcohol intake was associated with lower methylation at seven DMSs and higher TG. In contrast, increased carbohydrate intake was associated with higher DNA methylation at two DMSs (CPT1AandSLC7A11) and lower TG. Validation in the GOLDN further supports the findings.Conclusion:Our findings imply that TG-associated DMSs reflect dietary intakes, particularly alcoholic drinks, which could affect the current cardiometabolic riskviaepigenetic changes. This study illustrates a new method to map epigenetic signatures of environmental factors for disease risk. Identification of epigenetic markers of dietary intake can provide insight into an individual's risk of cardiovascular disease and support the application of precision nutrition.Clinical Trial Registration:www.ClinicalTrials.gov, the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), NCT00005121; the Genetics of Lipid Lowering Drugs and Diet Network (GOLDN), NCT01023750.Copyright © 2023 Lai, Parnell, Lee, Zeng, Smith, McKeown, Arnett and Ordovás."

"36870961","Maternal obesity and gestational diabetes reprogram the methylome of offspring beyond birth by inducing epigenetic signatures in metabolic and developmental pathways.","Cardiovasc Diabetol","Obesity is a negative chronic metabolic health condition that represents an additional risk for the development of multiple pathologies. Epidemiological studies have shown how maternal obesity or gestational diabetes mellitus during pregnancy constitute serious risk factors in relation to the appearance of cardiometabolic diseases in the offspring. Furthermore, epigenetic remodelling may help explain the molecular mechanisms that underlie these epidemiological findings. Thus, in this study we explored the DNA methylation landscape of children born to mothers with obesity and gestational diabetes during their first year of life.We used Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip arrays to profile more than 770,000 genome-wide CpG sites in blood samples from a paediatric longitudinal cohort consisting of 26 children born to mothers who suffered from obesity or obesity with gestational diabetes mellitus during pregnancy and 13 healthy controls (measurements taken at 0, 6 and 12 month; total N = 90). We carried out cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses to derive DNA methylation alterations associated with developmental and pathology-related epigenomics.We identified abundant DNA methylation changes during child development from birth to 6 months and, to a lesser extent, up to 12 months of age. Using cross-sectional analyses, we discovered DNA methylation biomarkers maintained across the first year of life that could discriminate children born to mothers who suffered from obesity or obesity with gestational diabetes. Importantly, enrichment analyses suggested that these alterations constitute epigenetic signatures that affect genes and pathways involved in the metabolism of fatty acids, postnatal developmental processes and mitochondrial bioenergetics, such as CPT1B, SLC38A4, SLC35F3 and FN3K. Finally, we observed evidence of an interaction between developmental DNA methylation changes and maternal metabolic condition alterations.Our observations highlight the first six months of development as being the most crucial for epigenetic remodelling. Furthermore, our results support the existence of systemic intrauterine foetal programming linked to obesity and gestational diabetes that affects the childhood methylome beyond birth, which involves alterations related to metabolic pathways, and which may interact with ordinary postnatal development programmes.© 2023.

"36869809","Genetic evidence for causal effects of socioeconomic, lifestyle, and cardiometabolic factors on epigenetic age acceleration.","J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci","GrimAge acceleration (GrimAgeAccel) and PhenoAge acceleration (PhenoAgeAccel) are DNA methylation-based markers of accelerated biological aging, standing out in predicting mortality and age-related cardiometabolic morbidities. Causal risk factors for GrimAgeAccel and PhenoAgeAccel are unclear. In this study, we performed two-sample univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate causal associations of 19 modifiable socioeconomic, lifestyle, and cardiometabolic factors with GrimAgeAccel and PhenoAgeAccel. Instrument variants representing 19 modifiable factors were extracted from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) with up to 1 million Europeans. Summary statistics for GrimAgeAccel and PhenoAgeAccel were derived from a GWAS of 34,710 Europeans. We identified 12 and eight factors causally associated with GrimAgeAccel and PhenoAgeAccel, respectively. Smoking was the strongest risk factor (β [SE]: 1.299 [0.107] year) for GrimAgeAccel, followed by higher alcohol intake, higher waist circumference, daytime napping, higher body fat percentage, higher body mass index, higher C-reactive protein, higher triglycerides, childhood obesity, and type 2 diabetes; whereas education was the strongest protective factor (β [SE]: -1.143 [0.121] year), followed by household income. Furthermore, higher waist circumference (β [SE]: 0.850 [0.269] year) and education (β [SE]: -0.718 [0.151] year) were the leading causal risk and protective factors for PhenoAgeAccel, respectively. Sensitivity analyses strengthened the robustness of these causal associations. Multivariable MR analyses further demonstrated independent effects of the strongest risk and protective factors on GrimAgeAccel and PhenoAgeAccel, respectively. In conclusion, our findings provide novel quantitative evidence on modifiable causal risk factors for accelerated epigenetic aging, suggesting promising intervention targets against age-related morbidity and improving healthy longevity.© The Author(s) 2023.

The Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama, is a major vector for the causative agents of Huanglongbing (HLB), which presents an unparalleled challenge to citrus production worldwide. Here, we identify the X chromosome of D. citri and investigate differences in the transcription and DNA methylation landscapes between adult virgin males and females. We find a large number of male-biased genes on the autosomes and a depletion of such on the X chromosome. We have also characterised the methylome of D. citri, finding low genome-wide levels, which is unusual for an hemipteran species, as well as evidence for both promoter and TE methylation. Overall, DNA methylation profiles are similar between the sexes but with a small number of differentially methylated genes found to be involved in sex differentiation. There also appears to be no direct relationship between differential DNA methylation and differential gene expression. Our findings lay the groundwork for the development of novel epigenetic-based pest control methods, and given the similarity of theD. citri methylome to some other insect species, these methods could be applicable across agricultural insect pests.© The Author(s) 2023.

"36869404","Epigenome-wide association study in Chinese monozygotic twins identifies DNA methylation loci associated with blood pressure.","Clin Epigenetics","Hypertension is a crucial risk factor for developing cardiovascular disease and reducing life expectancy. We aimed to detect DNA methylation (DNAm) variants potentially related to systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by conducting epigenome-wide association studies in 60 and 59 Chinese monozygotic twin pairs, respectively.Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling in whole blood of twins was performed using Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing, yielding 551,447 raw CpGs. Association between DNAm of single CpG and blood pressure was tested by applying generalized estimation equation. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified by comb-P approach. Inference about Causation through Examination of Familial Confounding was utilized to perform the causal inference. Ontology enrichment analysis was performed using Genomic Regions Enrichment of Annotations Tool. Candidate CpGs were quantified using Sequenom MassARRAY platform in a community population. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was conducted using gene expression data.The median age of twins was 52 years (95% range 40, 66). For SBP, 31 top CpGs (p < 1 × 10-4) and 8 DMRs were identified, with several DMRs within NFATC1, CADM2, IRX1, COL5A1, and LRAT. For DBP, 43 top CpGs (p < 1 × 10-4) and 12 DMRs were identified, with several DMRs within WNT3A, CNOT10, and DAB2IP. Important pathways, such as Notch signaling pathway, p53 pathway by glucose deprivation, and Wnt signaling pathway, were significantly enriched for SBP and DBP. Causal inference analysis suggested that DNAm at top CpGs within NDE1, MYH11, SRRM1P2, and SMPD4 influenced SBP, while SBP influenced DNAm at CpGs within TNK2. DNAm at top CpGs within WNT3A influenced DBP, while DBP influenced DNAm at CpGs within GNA14. Three CpGs mapped to WNT3A and one CpG mapped to COL5A1 were validated in a community population, with a hypermethylated and hypomethylated direction in hypertension cases, respectively. Gene expression analysis by WGCNA further identified some common genes and enrichment terms.We detect many DNAm variants that may be associated with blood pressure in whole blood, particularly the loci within WNT3A and COL5A1. Our findings provide new clues to the epigenetic modification underlying hypertension pathogenesis.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36865068","DNA methylation in cocaine use disorder-An epigenome-wide approach in the human prefrontal cortex.","Front Psychiatry","Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is characterized by a loss of control over cocaine intake and is associated with structural, functional, and molecular alterations in the human brain. At the molecular level, epigenetic alterations are hypothesized to contribute to the higher-level functional and structural brain changes observed in CUD. Most evidence of cocaine-associated epigenetic changes comes from animal studies while only a few studies have been performed using human tissue.We investigated epigenome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) signatures of CUD in human post-mortem brain tissue of Brodmann area 9 (BA9). A total ofN= 42 BA9 brain samples were obtained fromN= 21 individuals with CUD andN= 21 individuals without a CUD diagnosis. We performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) and analyzed CUD-associated differentially methylated regions (DMRs). To assess the functional role of CUD-associated differential methylation, we performed Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses and characterized co-methylation networks using a weighted correlation network analysis. We further investigated epigenetic age in CUD using epigenetic clocks for the assessment of biological age.While no cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) site was associated with CUD at epigenome-wide significance in BA9, we detected a total of 20 CUD-associated DMRs. After annotation of DMRs to genes, we identifiedNeuropeptide FF Receptor 2 (NPFFR2)andKalirin RhoGEF Kinase (KALRN)for which a previous role in the behavioral response to cocaine in rodents is known. Three of the four identified CUD-associated co-methylation modules were functionally related to neurotransmission and neuroplasticity. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks derived from module hub genes revealed several addiction-related genes as highly connected nodes such asCalcium Voltage-Gated Channel Subunit Alpha1 C (CACNA1C),Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 3 Group C Member 1 (NR3C1), andJun Proto-Oncogene, AP-1 Transcription Factor Subunit (JUN). In BA9, we observed a trend toward epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) in individuals with CUD remaining stable even after adjustment for covariates.Results from our study highlight that CUD is associated with epigenome-wide differences in DNAm levels in BA9 particularly related to synaptic signaling and neuroplasticity. This supports findings from previous studies that report on the strong impact of cocaine on neurocircuits in the human prefrontal cortex (PFC). Further studies are needed to follow up on the role of epigenetic alterations in CUD focusing on the integration of epigenetic signatures with transcriptomic and proteomic data.Copyright © 2023 Poisel, Zillich, Streit, Frank, Friske, Foo, Mechawar, Turecki, Hansson, Nöthen, Rietschel, Spanagel and Witt."
"36862625","Identification of SjÃ¶gren's syndrome patient subgroups by clustering of labial salivary gland DNA methylation profiles.","PLoS One","Heterogeneity in Sjögren's syndrome (SS), increasingly called Sjögren's disease, suggests the presence of disease subtypes, which poses a major challenge for the diagnosis, management, and treatment of this autoimmune disorder. Previous work distinguished patient subgroups based on clinical symptoms, but it is not clear to what extent symptoms reflect underlying pathobiology. The purpose of this study was to discover clinical meaningful subtypes of SS based on genome-wide DNA methylation data. We performed a cluster analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation data from labial salivary gland (LSG) tissue collected from 64 SS cases and 67 non-cases. Specifically, hierarchical clustering was performed on low dimensional embeddings of DNA methylation data extracted from a variational autoencoder to uncover unknown heterogeneity. Clustering revealed clinically severe and mild subgroups of SS. Differential methylation analysis revealed that hypomethylation at the MHC and hypermethylation at other genome regions characterize the epigenetic differences between these SS subgroups. Epigenetic profiling of LSGs in SS yields new insights into mechanisms underlying disease heterogeneity. The methylation patterns at differentially methylated CpGs are different in SS subgroups and support the role of epigenetic contributions to the heterogeneity in SS. Biomarker data derived from epigenetic profiling could be explored in future iterations of the classification criteria for defining SS subgroups.Copyright: This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

Resseliella maxima larvae feed on soybean stems which may induce plant death and can cause considerable yield losses, making it an important agricultural pest. From three pools of 50 adults each, we used long-read nanopore sequencing to assemble a R. maxima reference genome. The final genome assembly is 206 Mb with 64.88X coverage, consisting of 1009 contigs with an N50 size of 714 kb. The assembly is high quality with a BUSCO score of 87.8%. Genome-wide GC level is 31.60% and DNA methylation was measured at 1.07%. The R. maxima genome is comprised of 21.73% repetitive DNA, which is in line with other cecidomyiids. Protein prediction annotated 14,798 coding genes with 89.9% protein BUSCO score. Mitogenome analysis indicated that R. maxima assembly is a single circular contig of 15,301 bp and shares highest identity to the mitogenome of the Asian rice gall midge, Orseolia oryzae Wood-Mason.

Herein, we investigate the associations between prenatal SO2exposure and ADHD rating scale (ARS) at ages 4, 6 and 8 years repeatedly in a mother-child cohort (n = 329). Whole blood samples were obtained at ages 2 and 6 years, and genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) was analyzed for 51 children using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation BeadChip. We analyzed the associations between prenatal SO2exposure and DNAm levels at ages 2 and 6, and further investigated the association between the DNAm and ARS at ages 4, 6 and 8. Prenatal SO2exposure was associated with ADHD symptoms. From candidate gene analysis, DNAm levels at the 6 CpGs at age 2 were associated with prenatal SO2exposure levels. Of the 6 CpGs, cg07583420 (INS-IGF2) was persistently linked with ARS at ages 4, 6 and 8. Epigenome-wide analysis showed that DNAm at 6733 CpG sites were associated with prenatal SO2exposure, of which 58 CpGs involved in Notch signalling pathway were further associated with ARS at age 4, 6 and 8 years, persistently. DNAm at age 6 was not associated with prenatal SO2exposure. Changes in DNAm levels associated with prenatal SO2exposure during early childhood are associated with increases in ARS in later childhood.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Here, we present a genome-wide epigenetic dataset that quantifies DNA hydroxymethylation at single nucleotide resolution among full-sib Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) with distinct growth performance. In total, we obtained 355 million, 75 bp reads from 5 large- and 5 small-sized fish on an Illumina NextSeq500 platform. We identified several growth-related genes to be differentially hydroxymethylated, especially within gene bodies and promoters. Previously, we proposed that DNA hydroxymethylation greatly affects the earliest responses to adaptation and potentially drives genome evolution through its targeted enrichment and elevated nucleotide transversion rates. This dataset can be analysed in various contexts (e.g., epigenetics, evolution and growth) and compared to other epigenomic datasets in the future, namely DNA methylation and histone modifications. With forthcoming advancements in genome research, this hydroxymethylation dataset will also contribute to better understand the epigenetic regulation of key genomic features, such as cis-regulatory and transposable elements.© 2023.

Here, we performed EWAS analysis with longitudinally collected blood lipid data from survivors in the St. Jude lifetime cohort study.Among 2052 childhood cancer survivors of European ancestry (EA) and 370 survivors of African ancestry (AA), four types of blood lipids, including high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), total cholesterol (TC), and triglycerides (TG), were measured during follow-up beyond 5-years from childhood cancer diagnosis. For the exposure EWAS (i.e., lipids measured before blood draw for DNAm), the DNAm level was an outcome variable and each of the blood lipid level was an exposure variable; vice versa for the outcome EWAS (i.e., lipids measured after blood draw for DNAm).Among EA survivors, we identified 43 lipid-associated CpGs in the HDL (n = 7), TC (n = 3), and TG (n = 33) exposure EWAS, and 106 lipid-associated CpGs in the HDL (n = 5), LDL (n = 3), TC (n = 4), and TG (n = 94) outcome EWAS. Among AA survivors, we identified 15 lipid-associated CpGs in TG exposure (n = 6), HDL (n = 1), LDL (n = 1), TG (n = 5) and TC (n = 2) outcome EWAS with epigenome-wide significance (P < 9 × 10-8). There were no overlapping lipids-associated CpGs between exposure and outcome EWAS among EA and AA survivors, suggesting that the DNAm changes of different CpGs could be the cause or consequence of blood lipid levels. In the meta-EWAS, 12 additional CpGs reached epigenome-wide significance. Notably, 32 out of 74 lipid-associated CpGs showed substantial heterogeneity (Phet < 0.1 or I2 > 70%) between EA and AA survivors, highlighting differences in DNAm markers of blood lipids between populations with diverse genetic ancestry. Ten lipid-associated CpGs were cis-expression quantitative trait methylation with their DNAm levels associated with the expression of corresponding genes, out of which seven were negatively associated.We identified distinct signatures of DNAm for blood lipids as exposures or outcomes and between EA and AA survivors, revealing additional genes involved in lipid metabolism and potential novel targets for controlling blood lipids in childhood cancer survivors.© 2023.

"36855161","Refining epigenetic prediction of chronological and biological age.","Genome Med","Epigenetic clocks can track both chronological age (cAge) and biological age (bAge). The latter is typically defined by physiological biomarkers and risk of adverse health outcomes, including all-cause mortality. As cohort sample sizes increase, estimates of cAge and bAge become more precise. Here, we aim to develop accurate epigenetic predictors of cAge and bAge, whilst improving our understanding of their epigenomic architecture.First, we perform large-scale (N = 18,413) epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of chronological age and all-cause mortality. Next, to create a cAge predictor, we use methylation data from 24,674 participants from the Generation Scotland study, the Lothian Birth Cohorts (LBC) of 1921 and 1936, and 8 other cohorts with publicly available data. In addition, we train a predictor of time to all-cause mortality as a proxy for bAge using the Generation Scotland cohort (1214 observed deaths). For this purpose, we use epigenetic surrogates (EpiScores) for 109 plasma proteins and the 8 component parts of GrimAge, one of the current best epigenetic predictors of survival. We test this bAge predictor in four external cohorts (LBC1921, LBC1936, the Framingham Heart Study and the Women's Health Initiative study).Through the inclusion of linear and non-linear age-CpG associations from the EWAS, feature pre-selection in advance of elastic net regression, and a leave-one-cohort-out (LOCO) cross-validation framework, we obtain cAge prediction with a median absolute error equal to 2.3 years. Our bAge predictor was found to slightly outperform GrimAge in terms of the strength of its association to survival (HRGrimAge = 1.47 [1.40, 1.54] with p = 1.08 × 10-52, and HRbAge = 1.52 [1.44, 1.59] with p = 2.20 × 10-60). Finally, we introduce MethylBrowsR, an online tool to visualise epigenome-wide CpG-age associations.The integration of multiple large datasets, EpiScores, non-linear DNAm effects, and new approaches to feature selection has facilitated improvements to the blood-based epigenetic prediction of biological and chronological age.© 2023.

A commonly seen feature of the methylation data is the correlation between nearby CpG sites. Although such a spatial correlation was utilized in several epigenetic studies, its interaction to other characteristics of the methylation data has not been fully investigated.We filled this research gap from an information theoretic perspective, by exploring the impact of the spatial correlation on the methylation entropy (ME). With the spatial correlation taken into account, we derived the analytical relation between the ME and another key parameter, the methylation probability. By comparing it to the empirical relation between the two corresponding statistics, the observed ME and the mean methylation level, genomic loci under strong epigenetic control can be identified, which may serve as potential markers for cell-type specific methylation. The proposed method was validated by simulation studies, and applied to analyze a published dataset of mouse brain methylome.Compared to other sophisticated methods developed in literature, the proposed method provides a simple but effective way to detect CpG segments under strong epigenetic control (e.g., with bipolar methylation pattern). Findings from this study shed light on the identification of cell-type specific genes/pathways based on methylation data from a mixed cell population.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36823161","Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.","Nat Rev Dis Primers","Alcohol readily crosses the placenta and may disrupt fetal development. Harm from prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is determined by the dose, pattern, timing and duration of exposure, fetal and maternal genetics, maternal nutrition, concurrent substance use, and epigenetic responses. A safe dose of alcohol use during pregnancy has not been established. PAE can cause fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), which are characterized by neurodevelopmental impairment with or without facial dysmorphology, congenital anomalies and poor growth. FASD are a leading preventable cause of birth defects and developmental disability. The prevalence of FASD in 76 countries is >1% and is high in individuals living in out-of-home care or engaged in justice and mental health systems. The social and economic effects of FASD are profound, but the diagnosis is often missed or delayed and receives little public recognition. Future research should be informed by people living with FASD and be guided by cultural context, seek consensus on diagnostic criteria and evidence-based treatments, and describe the pathophysiology and lifelong effects of FASD. Imperatives include reducing stigma, equitable access to services, improved quality of life for people with FASD and FASD prevention in future generations.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."
"36834963","MicroRNAs and Gene Regulatory Networks Related to Cleft Lip and Palate.","Int J Mol Sci","Cleft lip and palate is one of the most common congenital birth defects and has a complex etiology. Either genetic or environmental factors, or both, are involved at various degrees, and the type and severity of clefts vary. One of the longstanding questions is how environmental factors lead to craniofacial developmental anomalies. Recent studies highlight non-coding RNAs as potential epigenetic regulators in cleft lip and palate. In this review, we will discuss microRNAs, a type of small non-coding RNAs that can simultaneously regulate expression of many downstream target genes, as a causative mechanism of cleft lip and palate in humans and mice."
"36707208","Gene-environment interactions in birth defect etiology: Challenges and opportunities.","Curr Top Dev Biol","Birth defects are relatively common congenital outcomes that significantly impact affected individuals, their families, and communities. Effective development and deployment of prevention and therapeutic strategies for these conditions requires sufficient understanding of etiology, including underlying genetic and environmental causes. Tremendous progress has been made in defining the genetic basis of familial and syndromic forms of birth defects. However, the majority of birth defect cases are considered nonsyndromic and thought to result from multifactorial gene-environment interactions. While substantial advances have been made in elucidating the genetic landscape of these etiologically complex conditions, significant biological and technical constraints have stymied progress toward a refined knowledge of environmental risk factors. Defining specific gene-environment interactions in birth defect etiology is even more challenging. However, progress has been made, including demonstration of critical proofs of concept and development of new conceptual and technical approaches for resolving complex gene-environment interactions. In this review, we discuss current views of multifactorial birth defect etiology, comparing them with other diseases that also involve gene-environment interactions, including primary immunodeficiency and cancer. We describe how various model systems have illuminated mechanisms of multifactorial etiology and these models' individual strengths and weaknesses. Finally, suggestions for areas of future emphasis are proposed.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"36798134","The initial interplay between HIV and mucosal innate immunity.","Front Immunol","Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is still one of the major global health issues, and despite significant efforts that have been put into studying the pathogenesis of HIV infection, several aspects need to be clarified, including how innate immunity acts in different anatomical compartments. Given the nature of HIV as a sexually transmitted disease, one of the aspects that demands particular attention is the mucosal innate immune response. Given this scenario, we focused our attention on the interplay between HIV and mucosal innate response: the different mucosae act as a physical barrier, whose integrity can be compromised by the infection, and the virus-cell interaction induces the innate immune response. In addition, we explored the role of the mucosal microbiota in facilitating or preventing HIV infection and highlighted how its changes could influence the development of several opportunistic infections. Although recent progress, a proper characterization of mucosal innate immune response and microbiota is still missing, and further studies are needed to understand how they can be helpful for the formulation of an effective vaccine.Copyright © 2023 Caputo, Libera, Sisti, Giuliani, Diotti and Criscuolo."

To investigate the involvement of 5mC/5hmC and m5C effector proteins contributing to the development of dementia neuropathology, RNA sequencing data of 31 effector proteins across four brain regions was examined in 56 aged non-affected and 51 Alzheimer's disease (AD) individuals obtained from the Aging, Dementia and Traumatic Brain Injury Study. Gene expression profiles were compared between AD and controls, between neuropathological Braak and CERAD scores and in individuals with a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI). We found an increase in the DNA methylation writers DNMT1, DNMT3A and DNMT3B messenger RNA (mRNA) and a decrease in the reader UHRF1 mRNA in AD samples across three brain regions whilst the DNA erasers GADD45B and AICDA showed changes in mRNA abundance within neuropathological load groupings. RNA methylation writers NSUN6 and NSUN7 showed significant expression differences with AD and, along with the reader ALYREF, differences in expression for neuropathologic ranking. A history of TBI was associated with a significant increase in the DNA readers ZBTB4 and MeCP2 (p < 0.05) and a decrease in NSUN6 (p < 0.001) mRNA. These findings implicate regulation of protein pathways disrupted in AD and TBI via multiple pre- and post-transcriptional mechanisms including potentially acting upon transfer RNAs, enhancer RNAs as well as nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling and cytoplasmic translational control. The targeting of such processes provides new therapeutic avenues for neurodegenerative brain conditions.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Implementable risk scores are needed to improve targeted prevention for patients that are particularly susceptible to complications. The epigenetic clock estimates an individual's biological age using DNA methylation profiles.In this study, we examined older adults of the Berlin Aging Study II that were reexamined on average 7.4 years after baseline assessment as part of the GendAge study. DNA methylation age (DNAmA) and its deviation from chronological age DNAmA acceleration (DNAmAA) were calculated with the 7-CpG clock (available at both timepoints, n = 1,071), Horvath's clock, Hannum's clock, PhenoAge and GrimAge (available at follow-up only, n = 1,067). T2D associated complications were assessed with the Diabetes Complications Severity Index (DCSI).We report on a statistically significant association between oral glucose tolerance test results and Hannum and PhenoAge DNAmAA. PhenoAge was also associated with fasting glucose. In contrast, we found no cross-sectional association after covariate adjustment between DNAmAA and a diagnosis of T2D. However, longitudinal analyses showed that every additional year of 7-CpG DNAmAA at baseline increased the odds for developing one or more additional complications or worsening of an already existing complication during the follow-up period by 11% in male participants with T2D. This association persisted after covariate adjustment (OR = 1.11, p = 0.045, n = 56).Although our results remain to be independently validated, this study shows promising evidence of utility of the 7-CpG clock in identifying patients with diabetes who are at high risk for developing complications.© 2023.

These imprinted loci generally show little variation across tissues, individuals, and populations. We show that such loci can be used to distinguish the maternal and paternal homologs for all human autosomes without the need for the parental DNA. We integrate methylation-detecting nanopore sequencing with the long-range phase information in Strand-seq data to determine the parent of origin of chromosome-length haplotypes for both DNA sequence and DNA methylation in five trios with diverse genetic backgrounds. The parent of origin was correctly inferred for all autosomes with an average mismatch error rate of 0.31% for SNVs and 1.89% for insertions or deletions (indels). Because our method can determine whether an inherited disease allele originated from the mother or the father, we predict that it will improve the diagnosis and management of many genetic diseases.© 2022 The Author(s)."
"36855151","DNA methylation as a potential mediator of the association between indoor air pollution and neurodevelopmental delay in a South African birth cohort.","Clin Epigenetics","Exposure to indoor air pollution during pregnancy has been linked to neurodevelopmental delay in toddlers. Epigenetic modification, particularly DNA methylation (DNAm), may explain this link. In this study, we employed three high-dimensional mediation analysis methods (HIMA, DACT, and gHMA) followed by causal mediation analysis to identify differentially methylated CpG sites and genes that mediate the association between indoor air pollution and neurodevelopmental delay. Analyses were performed using data from 142 mother to child pairs from a South African birth cohort, the Drakenstein Child Health Study. DNAm from cord blood was measured using the Infinium MethylationEPIC and HumanMethylation450 arrays. Neurodevelopment was assessed at age 2 years using the Bayley Scores of Infant and Toddler Development, 3rd edition across four domains (cognitive development, general adaptive behavior, language, and motor function). Particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 μm or less (PM10) was measured inside participants' homes during the second trimester of pregnancy.A total of 29 CpG sites and 4 genes (GOPC, RP11-74K11.1, DYRK1A, RNMT) were identified as significant mediators of the association between PM10and cognitive neurodevelopment. The estimated proportion mediated (95%-confidence interval) ranged from 0.29 [0.01, 0.86] for cg00694520 to 0.54 [0.11, 1.56] for cg05023582.Our findings suggest that DNAm may mediate the association between prenatal PM10exposure and cognitive neurodevelopment. DYRK1A and several genes that our CpG sites mapped to, including CNKSR1, IPO13, IFNGR1, LONP2, and CDH1, are associated with biological pathways implicated in cognitive neurodevelopment and three of our identified CpG sites (cg23560546 [DAPL1], cg22572779 [C6orf218], cg15000966 [NT5C]) have been previously associated with fetal brain development. These findings are novel and add to the limited literature investigating the relationship between indoor air pollution, DNAm, and neurodevelopment, particularly in low- and middle-income country settings and non-white populations.© 2023.

To better understand the carcinogenic mechanisms of air pollutants and identify predictive disease biomarkers, we examined the association between traffic-related pollutants with DNA methylation alterations and bulky DNA adducts, two biomarkers of carcinogen exposure and cancer risk, in the peripheral blood of 140 volunteers-95 traffic police officers, and 45 unexposed subjects. The DNA methylation and adduct measurements were performed by bisulfite-PCR and pyrosequencing and32P-postlabeling assay. Airborne levels of benzo(a)pyrene [B(a)P], carbon monoxide, and tropospheric O3were determined by personal exposure biomonitoring or by fixed monitoring stations. Overall, air pollution exposure was associated with a significant reduction (1.41 units) in global DNA methylation (95% C.I. -2.65-0.04,p= 0.026). The decrement inALUrepetitive elements was greatest in the policemen working downtown (95% C.I. -3.23--0.49,p= 0.008). The DNA adducts were found to be significantly increased (0.45 units) in the municipal officers with respect to unexposed subjects (95% C.I. 0.02-0.88,p= 0.039), mainly in those who were controlling traffic in downtown areas (95% C.I. 0.39-1.29,p< 0.001). Regression models indicated an increment ofALUmethylation at higher B(a)P concentrations (95% C.I. 0.03-0.60,p= 0.032). Moreover, statistical models showed a decrement inALUmethylation and an increment of DNA damage only above the cut-off value of 30 µg/m3O3. A significant increment of 0.73 units ofIL-6gene methylation was also found in smokers with respect to non-smokers. Our results highlighted the role of air pollution on epigenetic alterations and genotoxic effects, especially above the target value of 30 µg/m3surface-level O3, supporting the necessity for developing public health strategies aimed to reduce traffic-related air pollution molecular alterations."

To support genetic screening using preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) in a large population, the sequencing coverage goes below 0.1× to an ultra-low level. However, the feasibility and effectiveness of ultra-low-coverage WGS (ulcWGS) for GWAS remains undetermined.We built a pipeline to carry out analysis of ulcWGS data for GWAS. To examine its effectiveness, we benchmarked the accuracy of genotype imputation at the combination of different coverages below 0.1× and sample sizes from 2000 to 16,000, using 17,844 embryo PGT samples with approximately 0.04× average coverage and the standard Chinese sample HG005 with known genotypes. We then applied the imputed genotypes of 1744 transferred embryos who have gestational ages and complete follow-up records to GWAS.The accuracy of genotype imputation under ultra-low coverage can be improved by increasing the sample size and applying a set of filters. From 1744 born embryos, we identified 11 genomic risk loci associated with gestational ages and 166 genes mapped to these loci according to positional, expression quantitative trait locus, and chromatin interaction strategies. Among these mapped genes, CRHBP, ICAM1, and OXTR were more frequently reported as preterm birth related. By joint analysis of gene expression data from previous studies, we constructed interrelationships of mainly CRHBP, ICAM1, PLAGL1, DNMT1, CNTLN, DKK1, and EGR2 with preterm birth, infant disease, and breast cancer.This study not only demonstrates that ulcWGS could achieve relatively high accuracy of adequate genotype imputation and is capable of GWAS, but also provides insights into the associations between gestational age and genetic variations of the fetal embryos from Chinese population.© 2023.

"36712110","Measuring the long arm of childhood in real-time: Epigenetic predictors of BMI and social determinants of health across childhood and adolescence.","bioRxiv","Children who are socioeconomically disadvantaged are at increased risk for high body mass index (BMI) and multiple diseases in adulthood. The developmental origins of health and disease hypothesis proposes that early life conditions affect later-life health in a manner that is only partially modifiable by later-life experiences. Epigenetic mechanisms may regulate the influence of early life conditions on later life health. Recent epigenetic studies of adult blood samples have identified DNA-methylation sites associated with higher BMI and worse health (epigenetic-BMI). Here, we used longitudinal and twin study designs to examine whether epigenetic predictors of BMI developed in adults are valid biomarkers of child BMI and are sensitive to early life social determinants of health. Salivary epigenetic-BMI was calculated from two samples: (1) N=1,183 8-to-19-year-olds (609 female,meanage=13.4) from the Texas Twin Project (TTP), and (2) N=2,020 children (1,011 female) measured at 9 and 15 years from the Future of Families and Child Well-Being Study (FFCWS). We found that salivary epigenetic-BMI is robustly associated with childrenâ€™s BMI (r=0.36 tor=0.50). Longitudinal analysis suggested that epigenetic-BMI is highly stable across adolescence, but remains both a leading and lagging indicator of BMI change. Twin analyses showed that epigenetic-BMI captures differences in BMI between monozygotic twins. Moreover, children from more disadvantaged socioeconomic status (SES) and marginalized race/ethnic groups had higher epigenetic-BMI, even when controlling for concurrent BMI, pubertal development, and tobacco exposure. SES at birth relative to concurrent SES best predicted epigenetic-BMI in childhood and adolescence. We show for the first time that epigenetic predictors of BMI calculated from pediatric saliva samples are valid biomarkers of childhood BMI that are sensitive to social inequalities. Our findings are in line with the hypothesis that early life conditions are especially important factors in epigenetic regulation of later life health. Research showing that health later in life is linked to early life conditions have important implications for the development of early-life interventions that could significantly extend healthy life span."

Recent advances in molecular sequencing technology have revealed that epigenetic chromatin marks directly mediate critical events in retinal development, aging, and degeneration. Epigenetic signaling regulates retinal progenitor (RPC) cell cycle exit during retinal laminar development, giving rise to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), amacrine cells, horizontal cells, bipolar cells, photoreceptors, and Müller glia. Age-related epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation in the retina and optic nerve are accelerated in pathogenic conditions such as glaucoma and macular degeneration, but reversing these epigenetic marks may represent a novel therapeutic target. Epigenetic writers also integrate environmental signals such as hypoxia, inflammation, and hyperglycemia in complex retinal conditions such as diabetic retinopathy (DR) and choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors protect against apoptosis and photoreceptor degeneration in animal models of retinitis pigmentosa (RP). The epigenome represents an intriguing therapeutic target for age-, genetic-, and neovascular-related retinal diseases, though more work is needed before advancement to clinical trials."

Little is known about the biological processes that link the occurrence of these pregnancy complications with adverse child outcomes; altered biological aging of the growing fetus up to birth is one molecular pathway of increasing interest.To evaluate whether exposure to each of these 3 pregnancy complications (gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, and preeclampsia) is associated with accelerated or decelerated gestational biological age in children at birth.Children included in these analyses were born between 1998 and 2018 and spanned multiple geographic areas of the US. Pregnancy complication information was obtained from maternal self-report and/or medical record data. DNA methylation measures were obtained from blood biospecimens collected from offspring at birth. The study used data from the national Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) multisite cohort study collected and recorded as of the August 31, 2021, data lock date. Data analysis was performed from September 2021 to December 2022.Three pregnancy conditions were examined: gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and gestational diabetes.Accelerated or decelerated biological gestational age at birth, estimated using existing epigenetic gestational age clock algorithms.A total of 1801 child participants (880 male [48.9%]; median [range] chronological gestational age at birth, 39 [30-43] weeks) from 12 ECHO cohorts met the analytic inclusion criteria. Reported races included Asian (49 participants [2.7%]), Black (390 participants [21.7%]), White (1026 participants [57.0%]), and other races (92 participants [5.1%]) (ie, American Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, multiple races, and other race not specified). In total, 524 participants (29.0%) reported Hispanic ethnicity. Maternal ages ranged from 16 to 45 years of age with a median of 29 in the analytic sample. A range of maternal education levels, from less than high school (260 participants [14.4%]) to Bachelor's degree and above (629 participants [34.9%]), were reported. In adjusted regression models, prenatal exposure to maternal gestational diabetes (β, -0.423; 95% CI, -0.709 to -0.138) and preeclampsia (β, -0.513; 95% CI, -0.857 to -0.170), but not gestational hypertension (β, 0.003; 95% CI, -0.338 to 0.344), were associated with decelerated epigenetic aging among exposed neonates vs those who were unexposed. Modification of these associations, by sex, was observed with exposure to preeclampsia (β, -0.700; 95% CI, -1.189 to -0.210) and gestational diabetes (β, -0.636; 95% CI, -1.070 to -0.200), with associations observed among female but not male participants.This US cohort study of neonate biological changes related to exposure to maternal pregnancy conditions found evidence that preeclampsia and gestational diabetes delay biological maturity, especially in female offspring."

Study participants were 149 persons aged 50 and older, including 107 PWH and 42 seronegatives. All participants completed a blood draw, research medical evaluation, structured psychiatric interview, neurocognitive assessment, questionnaires, and measures of health literacy. Four epigenetic clocks were generated from stored blood samples using standardized laboratory methods. In regression models adjusting for sex and smoking status, PWH had significantly higher epigenetic aging acceleration values than seronegatives on all four indicators. Within the PWH sample, higher levels of epigenetic aging acceleration were moderately associated with lower current CD4 count, AIDS diagnoses, higher scores on the Veterans Aging Cohort Study Index, and lower telomere values. Higher epigenetic aging acceleration indices were also associated with lower health literacy among PWH. PWH experience accelerated aging as measured by a series of epigenetic clocks, which may be linked to immune compromise and risk of all-cause mortality. Health literacy may be a modifiable target for mitigating the risk of accelerated aging among older PWH.© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to American Aging Association."

Progress in next-generation sequencing technology has both greatly accelerated the pace of discovery of novel RDs and provided more accurate means for their diagnosis. RDs that are driven by altered epigenetic regulation with an underlying genetic basis are referred to as rare diseases of epigenetic origin (RDEOs). These diseases pose unique challenges in research, as they often show complex genetic and clinical heterogeneity arising from unknown gene-disease mechanisms. Furthermore, multiple other factors, including cell type and developmental time point, can confound attempts to deconvolute the pathophysiology of these disorders. These challenges are further exacerbated by factors that contribute to epigenetic variability and the difficulty of collecting sufficient participant numbers in human studies. However, new molecular and bioinformatics techniques will provide insight into how these disorders manifest over time.

"36769083",NA,NA,"Age acceleration (Age-A) is a useful tool that is able to predict a broad range of health outcomes. It is necessary to determine DNA methylation levels to estimate it, and it is known that Age-A is influenced by environmental, lifestyle, and vascular risk factors (VRF). The aim of this study is to estimate the contribution of these easily measurable factors to Age-A in patients with cerebrovascular disease (CVD), using different machine learning (ML) approximations, and try to find a more accessible model able to predict Age-A. We studied a CVD cohort of 952 patients with information about VRF, lifestyle habits, and target organ damage. We estimated Age-A using Hannum's epigenetic clock, and trained six different models to predict Age-A: a conventional linear regression model, four ML models (elastic net regression (EN), K-Nearest neighbors, random forest, and support vector machine models), and one deep learning approximation (multilayer perceptron (MLP) model). The best-performing models were EN and MLP; although, the predictive capability was modest (R20.358 and 0.378, respectively). In conclusion, our results support the influence of these factors on Age-A; although, they were not enough to explain most of its variability."
"36768576","An ELOVL2-Based Epigenetic Clock for Forensic Age Prediction: A Systematic Review.","Int J Mol Sci","The prediction of chronological age from methylation-based biomarkers represents one of the most promising applications in the field of forensic sciences. Age-prediction models developed so far are not easily applicable for forensic caseworkers. Among the several attempts to pursue this objective, the formulation of single-locus models might represent a good strategy. The present work aimed to develop an accurate single-locus model for age prediction exploitingELOVL2, a gene for which epigenetic alterations are most highly correlated with age. We carried out a systematic review of different published pyrosequencing datasets in which methylation of theELOVL2promoter was analysed to formulate age prediction models. Nine of these, with available datasets involving 2298 participants, were selected. We found that irrespective of which model was adopted, a very strong relationship betweenELOVL2methylation levels and age exists. In particular, the model giving the best age-prediction accuracy was the gradient boosting regressor with a prediction error of about 5.5 years. The findings reported here strongly support the use ofELOVL2for the formulation of a single-locus epigenetic model, but the inclusion of additional, non-redundant markers is a fundamental requirement to apply a molecular model to forensic applications with more robust results."

Epigenetic clock-derived DNA methylation age acceleration (DNAmAA) is among the most promising markers proposed to assess the interindividual differences in biological age. Further research is needed to evaluate the characteristics of the different epigenetic clock biomarkers available with respect to the health domains they reflect best.In this study, we have analyzed 779 participants of the LipidCardio study (mean chronological age 69.9 ± 11.0 years, 30.6% women) who underwent diagnostic angiography at the Charité University Hospital in Berlin, Germany. DNA methylation age (DNAm age) was measured by methylation-sensitive single nucleotide primer extension (MS-SNuPE) and calculated with the 7-CpG clock. We compared the biological age as assessed as DNAmAA of participants with an angiographically confirmed coronary artery disease (CAD, n = 554) with participants with lumen reduction of 50% or less (n = 90) and patients with a normal angiogram (n = 135).Participants with a confirmed CAD had on average a 2.5-year higher DNAmAA than patients with a normal angiogram. This association did not persist after adjustment for sex in a logistic regression analysis. High-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, lipoprotein (a), estimated glomerular filtration rate, physical activity, BMI, alcohol consumption, and smoking were not associated with DNAmAA.The association between higher DNAmAA and angiographically confirmed CAD seems to be mainly driven by sex.© 2023.

"36707505","Psychological and biological mechanisms linking trauma with cardiovascular disease risk.","Transl Psychiatry","Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, and experiences of psychological trauma have been associated with subsequent CVD onset. Identifying key pathways connecting trauma with CVD has the potential to inform more targeted screening and intervention efforts to offset elevated cardiovascular risk. In this narrative review, we summarize the evidence for key psychological and biological mechanisms linking experiences of trauma with CVD risk. Additionally, we describe various methodologies for measuring these mechanisms in an effort to inform future research related to potential pathways. With regard to mechanisms involving posttraumatic psychopathology, the vast majority of research on psychological distress after trauma and CVD has focused on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), even though posttraumatic psychopathology can manifest in other ways as well. Substantial evidence suggests that PTSD predicts the onset of a range of cardiovascular outcomes in trauma-exposed men and women, yet more research is needed to better understand posttraumatic psychopathology more comprehensively and how it may relate to CVD. Further, dysregulation of numerous biological systems may occur after trauma and in the presence of posttraumatic psychopathology; these processes of immune system dysregulation and elevated inflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, renin-angiotensin system dysregulation, and accelerated biological aging may all contribute to subsequent cardiovascular risk, although more research on these pathways in the context of traumatic stress is needed.

"36656735","Epigenetic age acceleration correlates with BMI in young adults.","Aging (Albany NY)","Obesity increases the risk of Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, several types of cancer, and other age-related disorders. Among older adults, obesity is also related to epigenetic age, typically measured with DNA methylation (DNAm). Because less is known about obesity and epigenetic aging earlier in the lifespan, this study examined the relationship between obesity and DNAm in young adulthood and whether these relationships vary by sex.A cross-sectional community sample of 290 healthy young adults (mean age 27.39 years, 60% female; 80% African American, 18% White) had their BMI and waist circumference measured. Four epigenetic age estimators were derived from salivary DNA: Hannum DNAm, Horvath DNAm, Phenoage DNAm, and GrimAge DNAm. Sociodemographic covariates included age, sex, race, parental education, and income-to-needs ratio.After adjusting for covariates, higher BMI and waist were associated with higher DNAm PhenoAge in both sexes, with a stronger effect on BMI in males (β = 0.35,p< .001) compared to females (β = 0.13,p= .002). Higher waist, but not BMI, was associated with higher Horvath DNA methylation age. Both BMI and waist circumference were associated with higher Hannum DNAm age in men but not in women. Neither BMI nor waist circumference were related to GrimAge.This study extends prior research by linking obesity with accelerated epigenetic aging in young adulthood, replicating the associations across two measures of obesity and four indices of salivary epigenetic aging. The results add to evidence that higher BMI accelerates aging early in the lifespan."

The purpose of this study was to examine the association of ACEs, both as a cumulative score and individual forms of adversity, with epigenetic age acceleration assessed using the DNA methylation (DNAm) GrimAge and DNAm PhenoAge epigenetic clocks in middle and older-aged adults. This cross-sectional study analyzed baseline and first follow-up data on 1445 participants aged 45-85 years from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA) who provided blood samples for DNAm analysis. ACEs were assessed using a validated self-reported questionnaire. Epigenetic age acceleration was estimated by regressing each epigenetic clock estimate on chronological age. Cumulative ACEs score was associated with higher DNAm GrimAge acceleration (β: 0.07; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.11) after adjusting for covariates. Childhood exposure to parental separation or divorce (β: 0.06; 95% CI: 0.00, 0.11) and emotional abuse (β: 0.06; 95% CI: 0.00, 0.12) were associated with higher DNAm GrimAge acceleration after adjusting for other adversities and covariates. There was no statistical association between ACEs and DNAm PhenoAge acceleration. Early life adversity may become biologically embedded and lead to premature biological aging, in relation to DNAm GrimAge, which estimates risk of mortality. Strategies that increase awareness of ACEs and promote healthy child development are needed to prevent ACEs.© 2023 The Authors. Aging Cell published by Anatomical Society and John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
"36622282","Alcohol consumption and epigenetic age acceleration in young adults.","Aging (Albany NY)","Alcohol is a widely consumed substance in the United States, however its effect on aging remains understudied. In this study of young adults, we examined whether cumulative alcohol consumption, i.e., alcohol years of beer, liquor, wine, and total alcohol, and recent binge drinking, were associated with four measures of age-related epigenetic changes via blood DNA methylation. A random subset of study participants in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study underwent DNA methylation profiling using the Illumina MethylationEPIC Beadchip. Participants with alcohol consumption and methylation data at examination years 15 (n= 1,030) and 20 (n= 945) were included. Liquor and total alcohol consumption were associated with a 0.31-year (P= 0.002) and a 0.12-year (P= 0.013) greater GrimAge acceleration (GAA) per additional five alcohol years, while beer and wine consumption observed marginal (P= 0.075) and no associations (P= 0.359) with GAA, respectively. Any recent binge drinking and the number of days of binge drinking were associated with a 1.38-year (P< 0.001) and a 0.15-year (P< 0.001) higher GAA, respectively. We observed statistical interactions between cumulative beer (P< 0.001) and total alcohol (P= 0.004) consumption with chronological age, with younger participants exhibiting a higher average in GAA compared to older participants. No associations were observed with the other measures of epigenetic aging. These results suggest cumulative liquor and total alcohol consumption and recent binge drinking may alter age-related epigenetic changes as captured by GAA. With the increasing aging population and widespread consumption of alcohol, these findings may have potential implications for lifestyle modification to promote healthy aging."
"36829165","Modeling the enigma of complex disease etiology.","J Transl Med","Complex diseases often present as a diagnosis riddle, further complicated by the combination of multiple phenotypes and diseases as features of other diseases. With the aim of enhancing the determination of key etiological factors, we developed and tested a complex disease model that encompasses diverse factors that in combination result in complex diseases. This model was developed to address the challenges of classifying complex diseases given the evolving nature of understanding of disease and interaction and contributions of genetic, environmental, and social factors.Here we present a new approach for modeling complex diseases that integrates the multiple contributing genetic, epigenetic, environmental, host and social pathogenic effects causing disease. The model was developed to provide a guide for capturing diverse mechanisms of complex diseases. Assessment of disease drivers for asthma, diabetes and fetal alcohol syndrome tested the model.We provide a detailed rationale for a model representing the classification of complex disease using three test conditions of asthma, diabetes and fetal alcohol syndrome. Model assessment resulted in the reassessment of the three complex disease classifications and identified driving factors, thus improving the model. The model is robust and flexible to capture new information as the understanding of complex disease improves.The Human Disease Ontology's Complex Disease model offers a mechanism for defining more accurate disease classification as a tool for more precise clinical diagnosis. This broader representation of complex disease, therefore, has implications for clinicians and researchers who are tasked with creating evidence-based and consensus-based recommendations and for public health tracking of complex disease. The new model facilitates the comparison of etiological factors between complex, common and rare diseases and is available at the Human Disease Ontology website.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Nine offsprings from ROSI were reported between 1996 and 2000. No successful deliveries were reported for 15 years after that. Tanaka et al. reported 90 babies born after ROSI and their follow-up studies in 2015 and 2018 showed no significant differences in comparison with those born after natural conception in terms of physical and cognitive abilities. However, clinical outcomes remain low.Clinical and laboratory data of successful cases in the precursor ROSI groups and those of Tanaka et al. were reviewed.Differences were found between the two groups in terms of identification of characteristics of round spermatid and oocyte activation. Additionally, epigenetic abnormalities were identified as underlying causes for poor ROSI results, besides correct identification of round spermatid and adequate oocyte activation. Correction of epigenetic errors could lead to optimal embryonic development.Correction of epigenetic abnormalities has a probability to improve the clinical outcome of ROSI.© 2023 The Authors.

This study aimed to examine the value of CMA and karyotyping in prenatal diagnosis after ART.This retrospective study included all singleton fetuses conceived by ART from January 2015 to December 2021. Anomalies prenatally diagnosed based on karyotyping and CMA were analyzed. Prevalence rates for various CMA and karyotyping results were stratified based on specific testing indications including isolated-and non-isolated ART groups. The rates of CMA findings with clinical significance (pathogenic/likely pathogenic) and karyotype anomalies were assessed and compared to those of local control individuals with naturally conceived pregnancies and without medical indications.In total, 224 subjects were assessed by karyotyping and CMA. In the examined patients, chromosomal and karyotype abnormality rates were 3.57% (8/224) and 8.93% (20/224), respectively. This finding indicated a 5.35% (12/224)-incremental rate of abnormal CMA was obtained over karyotype analysis (p = 0.019). The risk of CMA with pathogenic findings for all pregnancies conceived by ART (5.80%, 13/224) was markedly elevated in comparison with the background value obtained in control individuals (1.47%, 9/612;p = 0.001). In addition, risk of CMA with clinically pathogenic results in isolated ART groups was significant higher compared to the background risk reported in the control cohort (p = 0.037).Prenatal diagnosis including karyotyping and CMA is recommended for fetuses conceived by ART, with or without ultrasound findings.©2023 Guo et al."
"36768351","Insights into the Molecular Mechanisms Regulating Cell Behavior in Response to Magnetic Materials and Magnetic Stimulation in Stem Cell (Neurogenic) Differentiation.","Int J Mol Sci","Magnetic materials and magnetic stimulation have gained increasing attention in tissue engineering (TE), particularly for bone and nervous tissue reconstruction. Magnetism is utilized to modulate the cell response to environmental factors and lineage specifications, which involve complex mechanisms of action. Magnetic fields and nanoparticles (MNPs) may trigger focal adhesion changes, which are further translated into the reorganization of the cytoskeleton architecture and have an impact on nuclear morphology and positioning through the activation of mechanotransduction pathways. Mechanical stress induced by magnetic stimuli translates into an elongation of cytoskeleton fibers, the activation of linker in the nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex, and nuclear envelope deformation, and finally leads to the mechanical regulation of chromatin conformational changes. As such, the internalization of MNPs with further magnetic stimulation promotes the evolution of stem cells and neurogenic differentiation, triggering significant changes in global gene expression that are mediated by histone deacetylases (e.g., HDAC 5/11), and the upregulation of noncoding RNAs (e.g., miR-106b~25). Additionally, exposure to a magnetic environment had a positive influence on neurodifferentiation through the modulation of calcium channels' activity and cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation. This review presents an updated and integrated perspective on the molecular mechanisms that govern the cellular response to magnetic cues, with a special focus on neurogenic differentiation and the possible utility of nervous TE, as well as the limitations of using magnetism for these applications."
"36631980","The homeodomain of Oct4 is a dimeric binder of methylated CpG elements.","Nucleic Acids Res","Oct4 is essential to maintain pluripotency and has a pivotal role in establishing the germline. Its DNA-binding POU domain was recently found to bind motifs with methylated CpG elements normally associated with epigenetic silencing. However, the mode of binding and the consequences of this capability has remained unclear. Here, we show that Oct4 binds to a compact palindromic DNA element with a methylated CpG core (CpGpal) in alternative states of pluripotency and during cellular reprogramming towards induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). During cellular reprogramming, typical Oct4 bound enhancers are uniformly demethylated, with the prominent exception of the CpGpal sites where DNA methylation is often maintained. We demonstrate that Oct4 cooperatively binds the CpGpal element as a homodimer, which contrasts with the ectoderm-expressed POU factor Brn2. Indeed, binding to CpGpal is Oct4-specific as other POU factors expressed in somatic cells avoid this element. Binding assays combined with structural analyses and molecular dynamic simulations show that dimeric Oct4-binding to CpGpal is driven by the POU-homeodomain whilst the POU-specific domain is detached from DNA. Collectively, we report that Oct4 exerts parts of its regulatory function in the context of methylated DNA through a DNA recognition mechanism that solely relies on its homeodomain.© The Author(s) 2023.

"36850002","Regulatory networks driving expression of genes critical for glioblastoma are controlled by the transcription factor c-Jun and the pre-existing epigenetic modifications.","Clin Epigenetics","Glioblastoma (GBM, WHO grade IV) is an aggressive, primary brain tumor. Despite extensive tumor resection followed by radio- and chemotherapy, life expectancy of GBM patients did not improve over decades. Several studies reported transcription deregulation in GBMs, but regulatory mechanisms driving overexpression of GBM-specific genes remain largely unknown. Transcription in open chromatin regions is directed by transcription factors (TFs) that bind to specific motifs, recruit co-activators/repressors and the transcriptional machinery. Identification of GBM-related TFs-gene regulatory networks may reveal new and targetable mechanisms of gliomagenesis.We predicted TFs-regulated networks in GBMs in silico and intersected them with putative TF binding sites identified in the accessible chromatin in human glioma cells and GBM patient samples. The Cancer Genome Atlas and Glioma Atlas datasets (DNA methylation, H3K27 acetylation, transcriptomic profiles) were explored to elucidate TFs-gene regulatory networks and effects of the epigenetic background. In contrast to the majority of tumors, c-Jun expression was higher in GBMs than in normal brain and c-Jun binding sites were found in multiple genes overexpressed in GBMs, including VIM, FOSL2 or UPP1. Binding of c-Jun to the VIM gene promoter was stronger in GBM-derived cells than in cells derived from benign glioma as evidenced by gel shift and supershift assays. Regulatory regions of the majority of c-Jun targets have distinct DNA methylation patterns in GBMs as compared to benign gliomas, suggesting the contribution of DNA methylation to the c-Jun-dependent gene expression.GBM-specific TFs-gene networks identified in GBMs differ from regulatory pathways attributed to benign brain tumors and imply a decisive role of c-Jun in controlling genes that drive glioma growth and invasion as well as a modulatory role of DNA methylation.© 2023.

This mechanism has implications for uterine contractility during labor and for prevention or treatment of postpartum hemorrhage, an important contributor to global maternal morbidity and mortality.We measured and compared the level of OXTR DNA methylation between matched blood and uterine myometrium to evaluate blood as an indicator of uterine methylation status using targeted pyrosequencing and sites from the Illumina EPIC Array. Next, we tested for OXTR DNA methylation differences in blood between individuals who experienced a postpartum hemorrhage arising from uterine atony and matched controls following vaginal birth. Bivariate statistical tests, generalized linear modeling and Poisson regression were used in the analyses.Here we show a significant positive correlation between blood and uterine DNA methylation levels at several OXTR loci. Females with higher OXTR DNA methylation in blood had required significantly more exogenous oxytocin during parturition. With higher DNA methylation, those who had oxytocin administered during labor had significantly greater relative risk for postpartum hemorrhage (IRR 2.95, 95% CI 1.53-5.71).We provide evidence that epigenetic variability in OXTR is associated with the amount of oxytocin administered during parturition and moderates subsequent postpartum hemorrhage. Methylation can be measured using a peripheral tissue, suggesting potential use in identifying individuals susceptible to postpartum hemorrhage. Future studies are needed to quantify myometrial gene expression in connection with OXTR methylation.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36852276","Association between biological aging and lung cancer risk: Cohort study and Mendelian randomization analysis.","iScience","Chronological age only represents the passage of time, whereas biological age reflects the physiology states and the susceptibility to morbidity and mortality. The association between biological age and lung cancer risk remains controversial. Hence, we conducted a prospective analysis in the UK Biobank study and two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis to investigate this association. Biological aging was evaluated by PhenoAgeAccel, derived from routine clinical biomarkers. Independent of chronological age, PhenoAgeAccel was positively associated with the risk of overall and histological subtypes of lung cancer. There was a joint effect of PhenoAgeAccel and genetics in lung cancer incidence. In Mendelian randomization analysis, the genetically predicted PhenoAgeAccel was associated with the increased risk of overall lung cancer, small cell, and squamous cell carcinoma. Our findings suggest PhenoAgeAccel is an independent risk factor for lung cancer, which could be incorporated with polygenic risk score to identify high-risk individuals for lung cancer.© 2023 The Authors."

Directly reprogramming or converting astrocytes to neurons (AtN) in adult animals has been investigated as a potential strategy to facilitate brain and spinal cord recovery and advance fundamental biology. Conceptually, AtN strategies rely on forced expression or repression of lineage-specific transcription factors to make endogenous astrocytes become ""induced neurons"" (iNs), presumably without re-entering any pluripotent or multipotent states. The AtN-derived cells have been reported to manifest certain neuronal functions in vivo. However, this approach has raised many new questions and alternative explanations regarding the biological features of the end products (e.g., iNs versus neuron-like cells, neural functional changes, etc.), developmental biology underpinnings, and neurobiological essentials. For this paper per se, we proposed to draw an unconventional distinction between direct cell conversion and direct cell reprogramming, relative to somatic nuclear transfer, based on the experimental methods utilized to initiate the transformation process, aiming to promote a more in-depth mechanistic exploration. Moreover, we have summarized the current tactics employed for AtN induction, comparisons between the bench endeavors concerning outcome tangibility, and discussion of the issues of published AtN protocols. Lastly, the urgency to clearly define/devise the theoretical frameworks, cell biological bases, and bench specifics to experimentally validate primary data of AtN studies was highlighted."

"36759656","A new blood based epigenetic age predictor for adolescents and young adults.","Sci Rep","Children have special rights for protection compared to adults in our society. However, more than 1/4 of children globally have no documentation of their date of birth. Hence, there is a pressing need to develop biological methods for chronological age prediction, robust to differences in genetics, psychosocial events and physical living conditions. At present, DNA methylation is the most promising biological biomarker applied for age assessment. The human genome contains around 28 million DNA methylation sites, many of which change with age. Several epigenetic clocks accurately predict chronological age using methylation levels at age associated GpG-sites. However, variation in DNA methylation increases with age, and there is no epigenetic clock specifically designed for adolescents and young adults. Here we present a novel age Predictor for Adolescents and Young Adults (PAYA), using 267 CpG methylation sites to assess the chronological age of adolescents and young adults. We compared different preprocessing approaches and investigated the effect on prediction performance of the epigenetic clock. We evaluated performance using an independent validation data set consisting of 18-year-old individuals, where we obtained a median absolute deviation of just below 0.7 years. This tool may be helpful in age assessment of adolescents and young adults. However, there is a need to investigate the robustness of the age predictor across geographical and disease populations as well as environmental effects.© 2023. The Author(s)."

A total of 12,377 participants free of ischemic heart disease, stroke, or cancer at baseline were included, in which 8180 participants were identified to develop major coronary event (MCE), ischemic stroke (IS), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) or subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and 4197 remained free of these cardiovascular diseases before 1 January 2014. These participants were followed up until 1 Jan 2018. KDM-AA was calculated by regressing biological age measurement, which was constructed based on baseline 16 physical and 9 biochemical markers using Klemera and Doubal's method, on chronological age. We estimated the associations of KDM-AA with the mortality risk using the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) from Cox proportional hazard models. We assessed discrimination performance by Harrell's C-index and net reclassification index (NRI).The participants who developed MCE (mean KDM-AA = 0.1 year, standard deviation [SD] = 1.6 years) or ICH/SAH (0.3 ± 1.5 years) during subsequent follow-up showed accelerated aging at baseline compared to those of IS (0.0 ± 1.2 years) and control (-0.3 ± 1.3 years) groups. The KDM-AA was positively associated with long-term risk of all-cause mortality (HR = 1.20; 95% CI: 1.17, 1.23), and the association was robust for participants potentially at different stages of the CVD continuum. Adding KDM-AA improved mortality prediction compared to the model only with sociodemographic and lifestyle factors in whole participants, with the Harrell's C-index increasing from 0.813 (0.807, 0.819) to 0.821 (0.815, 0.826) (NRI = 0.011; 95% CI: 0.003, 0.019).In this middle-aged and elderly Chinese population, the KDM-AA is a promising measurement for biological age, and can capture the difference in cardiovascular health and predict the risk of all-cause mortality over a decade.This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (82192904, 82192901, 82192900, 81941018).

"36741436","Modeling biological age and its link with the aging process.","PNAS Nexus","Differences in health status at older ages are a result of genetic predispositions and physiological responses to exposure accumulation over the lifespan. These vary across individuals and lead to health status heterogeneity as people age. Chronological age (CA) is a standard indicator that reflects overall risks of morbidity and mortality. However, CA is only a crude proxy for individuals' latent physiological deterioration. An alternative to CA is biological age (BA), an indicator of accumulated age-related biological change reflected in markers of major physiological systems. We propose and validate two BA estimators that improve upon existing ones. These estimators (i) are based on a structural equation model (SEM) that represents the relation between BA and CA, (ii) circumvent the need to impose arbitrary assumptions about the relation between CA and BA, and (iii) provide tools to empirically test the validity of assumptions the researcher may wish to invoke. We use the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1988-1994 and compare results with three commonly used methods to compute BA (principal components-PCA, multiple regression-MLR, and Klemera-Doubal's method-KD). We show that SEM-based estimates of BA differ significantly from those generated by PCA and MLR and are comparable to, but have better predictive power than KD's. The proposed estimators are flexible, allow testing of assumptions about functional forms relating BA and CA, and admit a rich interpretation as indicators of accelerated aging.© The Author(s) 2022.

The material for the study was the blood of volunteers aged 21 to 102 years. Polymorphisms were determined by real-time PCR. Multichannel volumetric sphygmography was performed to analyze the functional state of the vascular wall. The study revealed that thers5742904polymorphism of theApoBgene was found to be absent in the studied groups of long-livers and descendants of long-livers. Results indicated that the carriage of the heterozygous variant of theMMP9polymorphism is associated with a favorable prognosis for cardiovascular system functioning. A tendency towards an increase in the rate of biological age acceleration among subgroups with AA and GG genotypes of theMMP9gene and a negative value of biological age acceleration among heterozygous carriers of this polymorphism allele were found. The conducted studies make it possible to identify new associations of the studied polymorphisms with the functional state of the cardiovascular system, which is of great clinical importance and requires further study."

However, the high dimensional, discrete, and sparse nature of the data make the downstream analysis particularly challenging. Most of the existing computational methods for single-cell data analysis are either limited to single modality or lack flexibility and interpretability. In this study, we propose an interpretable deep learning method called multi-omic embedded topic model (moETM) to effectively perform integrative analysis of high-dimensional single-cell multimodal data. moETM integrates multiple omics data via a product-of-experts in the encoder for efficient variational inference and then employs multiple linear decoders to learn the multi-omic signatures of the gene regulatory programs. Through comprehensive experiments on public single-cell transcriptome and chromatin accessibility data (i.e., scRNA+scATAC), as well as scRNA and proteomic data (i.e., CITE-seq), moETM demonstrates superior performance compared with six state-of-the-art single-cell data analysis methods on seven publicly available datasets. By applying moETM to the scRNA+scATAC data in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), we identified sequence motifs corresponding to the transcription factors that regulate immune gene signatures. Applying moETM analysis to CITE-seq data from the COVID-19 patients revealed not only known immune cell-type-specific signatures but also composite multi-omic biomarkers of critical conditions due to COVID-19, thus providing insights from both biological and clinical perspectives."

We previously identified a myeloid cell subset in the brain and spinal cord that expresses the surface markers CD88 and CD317 and is associated with the onset and persistence of clinical disease in the murine model of the human CNS autoimmune disorder, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We employed an experimental platform utilizing single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling of bone marrow-chimeric mice to categorically distinguish BMC from microglia during CNS autoimmunity. Analysis of gene expression and chromosomal accessibility identified CD88+CD317+myeloid cells in the CNS of EAE mice as originating from BMC and microglia. Interestingly, each cell lineage exhibited overlapping and unique gene expression patterns and transcription factor motifs that allowed their segregation. Our observations will facilitate determining pathogenic contributions of BMC and microglia in CNS autoimmune disease. Ultimately, this agnostic characterization of myeloid cells will be required for devising disease stage-specific and tissue-specific interventions for CNS inflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders."

Pedigree data were provided to trace back up to five generations to construct theAmatrix with changing the pedigree depth from 1 to 5 (five MCA methods). Genotype information on 36,426 single-nucleotide polymorphisms was used to calculate theGmatrix based on VanRaden's methods 1 and 2 (two MCG methods). The MCG always selected one cow per iteration, while MCA sometimes selected multiple cows. The number of commonly selected cows between the MCA and MCG methods was generally lower than that between different MCA methods or between different MCG methods. For the studied population, MCG appeared to be more reasonable than MCA in selecting cows as a reference population for higher-density genotype imputation to perform genomic prediction and a genome-wide association study."

By considering GRS and PRS as predictors that are measured with error, insights into their strengths and weaknesses may be obtained, and SNP selection approaches play an important role in defining such errors.Copyright © 2022 St.-Pierre, Zhang, Lu, Jiang, Loffree, Wang, Bhatnagar and Greenwood."
"36809357","The identification of mediating effects using genome-based restricted maximum likelihood estimation.","PLoS Genet","Mediation analysis is commonly used to identify mechanisms and intermediate factors between causes and outcomes. Studies drawing on polygenic scores (PGSs) can readily employ traditional regression-based procedures to assess whether trait M mediates the relationship between the genetic component of outcome Y and outcome Y itself. However, this approach suffers from attenuation bias, as PGSs capture only a (small) part of the genetic variance of a given trait. To overcome this limitation, we developed MA-GREML: a method for Mediation Analysis using Genome-based Restricted Maximum Likelihood (GREML) estimation. Using MA-GREML to assess mediation between genetic factors and traits comes with two main advantages. First, we circumvent the limited predictive accuracy of PGSs that regression-based mediation approaches suffer from. Second, compared to methods employing summary statistics from genome-wide association studies, the individual-level data approach of GREML allows to directly control for confounders of the association between M and Y. In addition to typical GREML parameters (e.g., the genetic correlation), MA-GREML estimates (i) the effect of M on Y, (ii) the direct effect (i.e., the genetic variance of Y that is not mediated by M), and (iii) the indirect effect (i.e., the genetic variance of Y that is mediated by M). MA-GREML also provides standard errors of these estimates and assesses the significance of the indirect effect. We use analytical derivations and simulations to show the validity of our approach under two main assumptions, viz., that M precedes Y and that environmental confounders of the association between M and Y are controlled for. We conclude that MA-GREML is an appropriate tool to assess the mediating role of trait M in the relationship between the genetic component of Y and outcome Y. Using data from the US Health and Retirement Study, we provide evidence that genetic effects on Body Mass Index (BMI), cognitive functioning and self-reported health in later life run partially through educational attainment. For mental health, we do not find significant evidence for an indirect effect through educational attainment. Further analyses show that the additive genetic factors of these four outcomes do partially (cognition and mental health) and fully (BMI and self-reported health) run through an earlier realization of these traits.Copyright: © 2023 Rietveld et al.

"36759513","A method for an unbiased estimate of cross-ancestry genetic correlation using individual-level data.","Nat Commun","Cross-ancestry genetic correlation is an important parameter to understand the genetic relationship between two ancestry groups. However, existing methods cannot properly account for ancestry-specific genetic architecture, which is diverse across ancestries, producing biased estimates of cross-ancestry genetic correlation. Here, we present a method to construct a genomic relationship matrix (GRM) that can correctly account for the relationship between ancestry-specific allele frequencies and ancestry-specific allelic effects. Through comprehensive simulations, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods in the estimations of SNP-based heritability and cross-ancestry genetic correlation. The proposed method is further applied to anthropometric and other complex traits from the UK Biobank data across ancestry groups. For obesity, the estimated genetic correlation between African and European ancestry cohorts is significantly different from unity, suggesting that obesity is genetically heterogenous between these two ancestries.© 2023.

"36755099","Polygenic architecture of rare coding variation across 394,783 exomes.","Nature","Both common and rare genetic variants influence complex traits and common diseases. Genome-wide association studies have identified thousands of common-variant associations, and more recently, large-scale exome sequencing studies have identified rare-variant associations in hundreds of genes1-3. However, rare-variant genetic architecture is not well characterized, and the relationship between common-variant and rare-variant architecture is unclear4. Here we quantify the heritability explained by the gene-wise burden of rare coding variants across 22 common traits and diseases in 394,783 UK Biobank exomes5. Rare coding variants (allele frequency < 1 × 10-3) explain 1.3% (s.e. = 0.03%) of phenotypic variance on average-much less than common variants-and most burden heritability is explained by ultrarare loss-of-function variants (allele frequency < 1 × 10-5). Common and rare variants implicate the same cell types, with similar enrichments, and they have pleiotropic effects on the same pairs of traits, with similar genetic correlations. They partially colocalize at individual genes and loci, but not to the same extent: burden heritability is strongly concentrated in significant genes, while common-variant heritability is more polygenic, and burden heritability is also more strongly concentrated in constrained genes. Finally, we find that burden heritability for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder6,7is approximately 2%. Our results indicate that rare coding variants will implicate a tractable number of large-effect genes, that common and rare associations are mechanistically convergent, and that rare coding variants will contribute only modestly to missing heritability and population risk stratification.© 2023.

"36712099","Genetic association studies using disease liabilities from deep neural networks.","medRxiv","The case-control study is a widely used method for investigating the genetic landscape of binary traits. However, the health-related outcome or disease status of participants in long-term, prospective cohort studies such as the UK Biobank are subject to change. Here, we develop an approach for the genetic association study leveraging disease liabilities computed from a deep patient phenotyping framework (AI-based liability). Analyzing 44 common traits in 261,807 participants from the UK Biobank, we identified novel loci compared to the conventional case-control (CC) association studies. Our results showed that combining liability scores with CC status was more powerful than the CC-GWAS in detecting independent genetic loci across different diseases. This boost in statistical power was further reflected in increased SNP-based heritability estimates. Moreover, polygenic risk scores calculated from AI-based liabilities better identified newly diagnosed cases in the 2022 release of the UK Biobank that served as controls in the 2019 version (6.2% percentile rank increase on average). These findings demonstrate the utility of deep neural networks that are able to model disease liabilities from high-dimensional phenotypic data in large-scale population cohorts. Our pipeline of genome-wide association studies with disease liabilities can be applied to other biobanks with rich phenotype and genotype data."
"36835113","Progress in Discovering Transcriptional Noise in Aging.","Int J Mol Sci","Increasing stochasticity is a key feature in the aging process. At the molecular level, in addition to genome instability, a well-recognized hallmark of aging, cell-to-cell variation in gene expression was first identified in mouse hearts. With the technological breakthrough in single-cell RNA sequencing, most studies performed in recent years have demonstrated a positive correlation between cell-to-cell variation and age in human pancreatic cells, as well as mouse lymphocytes, lung cells, and muscle stem cells during senescence in vitro. This phenomenon is known as the ""transcriptional noise"" of aging. In addition to the increasing evidence in experimental observations, progress also has been made to better define transcriptional noise. Traditionally, transcriptional noise is measured using simple statistical measurements, such as the coefficient of variation, Fano factor, and correlation coefficient. Recently, multiple novel methods have been proposed, e.g., global coordination level analysis, to define transcriptional noise based on network analysis of gene-to-gene coordination. However, remaining challenges include a limited number of wet-lab observations, technical noise in single-cell RNA sequencing, and the lack of a standard and/or optimal data analytical measurement of transcriptional noise. Here, we review the recent technological progress, current knowledge, and challenges to better understand transcriptional noise in aging."

Here, we comprehensively profiled the NK cell response in a cohort of 264 Ugandan children. Repeated malaria exposure was associated with expansion of an atypical, CD56negpopulation of NK cells that differed transcriptionally, epigenetically, and phenotypically from CD56dimNK cells, including decreased expression of PLZF and the Fc receptor γ-chain, increased histone methylation, and increased protein expression of LAG-3, KIR, and LILRB1. CD56negNK cells were highly functional and displayed greater antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity than CD56dimNK cells. Higher frequencies of CD56negNK cells were associated with protection against symptomatic malaria and high parasite densities. After marked reductions in malaria transmission, frequencies of these cells rapidly declined, suggesting that continuous exposure toPlasmodium falciparumis required to maintain this modified, adaptive-like NK cell subset."

"36635516","Multiparameter single-cell proteomic technologies give new insights into the biology of ovarian tumors.","Semin Immunopathol","High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is the most lethal gynecological malignancy. Its diagnosis at advanced stage compounded with its excessive genomic and cellular heterogeneity make curative treatment challenging. Two critical therapeutic challenges to overcome are carboplatin resistance and lack of response to immunotherapy. Carboplatin resistance results from diverse cell autonomous mechanisms which operate in different combinations within and across tumors. The lack of response to immunotherapy is highly likely to be related to an immunosuppressive HGSOC tumor microenvironment which overrides any clinical benefit. Results from a number of studies, mainly using transcriptomics, indicate that the immune tumor microenvironment (iTME) plays a role in carboplatin response. However, in patients receiving treatment, the exact mechanistic details are unclear. During the past decade, multiplex single-cell proteomic technologies have come to the forefront of biomedical research. Mass cytometry or cytometry by time-of-flight, measures up to 60 parameters in single cells that are in suspension. Multiplex cellular imaging technologies allow simultaneous measurement of up to 60 proteins in single cells with spatial resolution and interrogation of cell-cell interactions. This review suggests that functional interplay between cell autonomous responses to carboplatin and the HGSOC immune tumor microenvironment could be clarified through the application of multiplex single-cell proteomic technologies. We conclude that for better clinical care, multiplex single-cell proteomic technologies could be an integral component of multimodal biomarker development that also includes genomics and radiomics. Collection of matched samples from patients before and on treatment will be critical to the success of these efforts.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Liver biopsy is required in the diagnosis of Antimitochondrial antibody-negative patients. Therefore, novel biomarkers are needed for the non-invasive diagnosis of PBC. To identify novel biomarkers for PBC, we conducted large-scale plasma proteome Mendelian randomization (MR).A total of 21,593 protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) for 2297 circulating proteins were used and classified into four different groups. MR analyses were conducted in the four groups separately. Furthermore, the results were discovered and replicated in two different cohorts of PBC. Colocalization analysis and enrichment analysis were also conducted.Three plasma proteins (ficolin-1, CD40 and protein FAM177A1) were identified and replicated as being associated with PBC. All of them showed significant protective effects against PBC. An increase in ficolin-1 (OR=0.890 [0.843-0.941], p=3.50×10-5), CD40 (OR=0.814 [0.741-0.895], p=1.96×10-5) and protein FAM177A1 (OR=0.822 [0.754-0.897], p=9.75×10-6) reduced the incidence of PBC. Ficolin-1 (PP4 = 0.994) and protein FAM177A1 (PP4 = 0.995) colocalized with the expression of the genes FCN1 and FAM177A1 in whole blood, respectively. Furthermore, CD40 (PP4 = 0.977) and protein FAM177A1 (PP4 = 0.897) strongly colocalized with PBC.We expand the current biomarkers for PBC. In total, three (ficolin-1, CD40, and protein FAM177A1) plasma proteins were identified and replicated as being associated with PBC in MR analysis.

As obesity influences the plasma proteome, we sought to identify circulating proteins mediating the effects of obesity on COVID-19 severity in humans. Here, we screened 4,907 plasma proteins to identify proteins influenced by body mass index using Mendelian randomization. This yielded 1,216 proteins, whose effect on COVID-19 severity was assessed, again using Mendelian randomization. We found that an s.d. increase in nephronectin (NPNT) was associated with increased odds of critically ill COVID-19 (OR = 1.71, P = 1.63 × 10-10). The effect was driven by an NPNT splice isoform. Mediation analyses supported NPNT as a mediator. In single-cell RNA-sequencing, NPNT was expressed in alveolar cells and fibroblasts of the lung in individuals who died of COVID-19. Finally, decreasing body fat mass and increasing fat-free mass were found to lower NPNT levels. These findings provide actionable insights into how obesity influences COVID-19 severity.© 2023.

Individual methodologies complementarily prioritized drugs and drug targets, which were systematically validated by referring previously known drug-disease relationships. Integration of the three methodologies provided a comprehensive catalog of candidate drugs for repositioning, nominating promising drug candidates targeting the genes involved in the coagulation process for venous thromboembolism and the interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 signaling pathway for gout.

"36768586","Understanding How Cells Probe the World: A Preliminary Step towards Modeling Cell Behavior?","Int J Mol Sci","Cell biologists have long aimed at quantitatively modeling cell function. Recently, the outstanding progress of high-throughput measurement methods and data processing tools has made this a realistic goal. The aim of this paper is twofold: First, to suggest that, while much progress has been done in modeling cell states and transitions, current accounts of environmental cues driving these transitions remain insufficient. There is a need to provide an integrated view of the biochemical, topographical and mechanical information processed by cells to take decisions. It might be rewarding in the near future to try to connect cell environmental cues to physiologically relevant outcomes rather than modeling relationships between these cues and internal signaling networks. The second aim of this paper is to review exogenous signals that are sensed by living cells and significantly influence fate decisions. Indeed, in addition to the composition of the surrounding medium, cells are highly sensitive to the properties of neighboring surfaces, including the spatial organization of anchored molecules and substrate mechanical and topographical properties. These properties should thus be included in models of cell behavior. It is also suggested that attempts at cell modeling could strongly benefit from two research lines: (i) trying to decipher the way cells encode the information they retrieve from environment analysis, and (ii) developing more standardized means of assessing the quality of proposed models, as was done in other research domains such as protein structure prediction."

(E-MTAB-6667). Data from gene expression profiling of immunomagnetically sorted CD4+, CD8+, CD14+, CD15+, and CD19+cells were processed. Differential expression analyses were conducted in each immune cell type, followed by gene ontology analysis and supplementary investigations.Ninety-four differentially expressed genes were found (CD8+n = 58, CD14+n = 20, CD4+n = 14, CD19+n = 2). Two key smoking-related genes were overexpressed in specific cell types: LRRN3 (CD4+, CD8+) and MMP25 (CD8+, CD14+). In CD4+cells smoking was associated with reduced expression of the NK cell receptor KLRB1, suggesting CD4+subpopulation shifts and differences in interferon signaling (reduced IRF1 and IL18RAP in smokers). Key results and their integration with an immune protein-protein interaction network revealed that smoking influences integrins in CD8+cells (ITGB7, ITGAL, ITGAM, ITGB2). C-type lectin CLEC4A was reduced in CD8+cells and CLEC10A was increased in CD14+cells from smokers; moreover, CLEC5A (CD8+), CLEC7A (CD8+) and CLEC9A (CD19+) were related to smoking in supplementary analyses.

"36774368","STR-based feature extraction and selection for genetic feature discovery in neurological disease genes.","Sci Rep","Gene expression, often determined by single nucleotide polymorphisms, short repeated sequences known as short tandem repeats (STRs), structural variants, and environmental factors, provides means for an organism to produce gene products necessary to live. Variation in expression levels, sometimes known as enrichment patterns, has been associated with disease progression. Thus, the STR enrichment patterns have recently gained interest as potential genetic markers for disease progression. However, to the best of our knowledge, we are unaware of any study that evaluates and explores STRs, particularly trinucleotide sequences, as machine learning features for classifying neurological disease genes for the purpose of discovering genetic features. Thus, in this paper, we proposed a new metric and a novel feature extraction and selection algorithm based on statistically significant STR-based features and their respective enrichment patterns to create a statistically significant feature set. The proposed new metric has shown that the neurological disease family genes have a non-random AA, AT, TA, TG, and TT enrichment pattern. This is an important result, as it supports prior research that has established that certain trinucleotides, such as AAT, ATA, ATT, TAT, and TTA, are favored during protein misfolding. In contrast, trinucleotides, such as TAA, TAG, and TGA, are favored during premature termination codon mutations as they are stop codons. This suggests that the metric has the potential to identify patterns that may be genetic features in a sample of neurological genes. Moreover, the practical performance and high prediction results of the statistically significant STR-based feature set indicate that variations in STR enrichment patterns can distinguish neurological disease genes. In conclusion, the proposed approach may have the potential to discover differential genetic features for other diseases.© 2023. The Author(s)."

"36698218","Dynamic changes in whole genome DNA methylation, chromatin and gene expression during mouse lens differentiation.","Epigenetics Chromatin","Cellular differentiation is marked by temporally and spatially coordinated gene expression regulated at multiple levels. DNA methylation represents a universal mechanism to control chromatin organization and its accessibility. Cytosine methylation of CpG dinucleotides regulates binding of methylation-sensitive DNA-binding transcription factors within regulatory regions of transcription, including promoters and distal enhancers. Ocular lens differentiation represents an advantageous model system to examine these processes as lens comprises only two cell types, the proliferating lens epithelium and postmitotic lens fiber cells all originating from the epithelium.Using whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and microdissected lenses, we investigated dynamics of DNA methylation and chromatin changes during mouse lens fiber and epithelium differentiation between embryos (E14.5) and newborns (P0.5). Histone H3.3 variant chromatin landscapes were also generated for both P0.5 lens epithelium and fibers by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next generation sequencing (ChIP-seq). Tissue-specific features of DNA methylation patterns are demonstrated via comparative studies with embryonic stem (ES) cells and neural progenitor cells (NPCs) at Nanog, Pou5f1, Sox2, Pax6 and Six3 loci. Comparisons with ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data demonstrate that reduced methylation is associated with increased expression of fiber cell abundant genes, including crystallins, intermediate filament (Bfsp1 and Bfsp2) and gap junction proteins (Gja3 and Gja8), marked by high levels of histone H3.3 within their transcribed regions. Interestingly, Pax6-binding sites exhibited predominantly DNA hypomethylation in lens chromatin. In vitro binding of Pax6 proteins showed Pax6's ability to interact with sites containing one or two methylated CpG dinucleotides.Our study has generated the first data on methylation changes between two different stages of mammalian lens development and linked these data with chromatin accessibility maps, presence of histone H3.3 and gene expression. Reduced DNA methylation correlates with expression of important genes involved in lens morphogenesis and lens fiber cell differentiation.© 2023. The Author(s)."

We aimed to perform a systematic comparison of the behaviour of these methods, using cord blood DNAm from the LIMIT RCT, in relation to detecting hypothesised effects of interest (intervention and pre-pregnancy maternal BMI) as well as effects known to be spurious, and known to be present.DNAm data, from 645 cord blood samples analysed using Illumina 450K BeadChip arrays, were normalised using three different methods (with probe filtering undertaken pre- or post- normalisation). Batch effects were handled with a supervised algorithm, an unsupervised algorithm, or adjustment in the analysis model. Analysis was undertaken with and without adjustment for estimated cell type proportions. The effects estimated included intervention and BMI (effects of interest in the original study), infant sex and randomly assigned groups. Data processing and analysis methods were compared in relation to number and identity of differentially methylated probes, rankings of probes by p value and log-fold-change, and distributions ofpvalues and log-fold-change estimates.There were differences corresponding to each of the processing and analysis choices. Importantly, some combinations of data processing choices resulted in a substantial number of spurious 'significant' findings.

"36634865","Does maternal low-dose cadmium exposure increase the risk of offspring to develop metabolic syndrome and/or type 2 diabetes?","Life Sci","Cadmium is a hazardous metal with multiple organ toxicity that causes great harm to human health. Cadmium enters the human body through occupational exposure, diet, drinking water, breathing, and smoking. Cadmium accumulation in the human body is associated with increased risk of developing obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome (MetS). Cadmium uptake is enhanced during pregnancy and can cross the placenta affecting placental development and function. Subsequently, cadmium can pass to fetus, gathering in multiple organs such as the liver and pancreas. Early-life cadmium exposure can induce hepatic oxidative stress and pancreatic β-cell dysfunction, resulting in insulin resistance and glucose metabolic dyshomeostasis in the offspring. Prenatal exposure to cadmium is also associated with increasing epigenetic effects on the offspring's multi-organ functions. However, whether and how maternal exposure to low-dose cadmium impacts the risks of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D) in the young and/or adult offspring remains unclear. This review collected available data to address the current evidence for the potential role of cadmium exposure, leading to insulin resistance and the development of T2D in offspring. However, this review reveals that underlying mechanisms linking prenatal cadmium exposure during pregnancy with T2D in offspring remain to be adequately investigated.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

"36803965","Hypoxia induces alterations in tRNA modifications involved in translational control.","BMC Biol","Adaptation to high-altitude hypobaric hypoxia has been shown to require a set of physiological traits enabled by an associated set of genetic modifications, as well as transcriptome regulation. These lead to both lifetime adaptation of individuals to hypoxia at high altitudes and generational evolution of populations as seen for instance in those of Tibet. Additionally, RNA modifications, which are sensitive to environmental exposure, have been shown to play pivotal biological roles in maintaining the physiological functions of organs. However, the dynamic RNA modification landscape and related molecular mechanisms in mouse tissues under hypobaric hypoxia exposure remain to be fully understood. Here, we explore the tissue-specific distribution pattern of multiple RNA modifications across mouse tissues.By applying an LC-MS/MS-dependent RNA modification detection platform, we identified the distribution of multiple RNA modifications in total RNA, tRNA-enriched fragments, and 17-50-nt sncRNAs across mouse tissues; these patterns were associated with the expression levels of RNA modification modifiers in different tissues. Moreover, the tissue-specific abundance of RNA modifications was sensitively altered across different RNA groups in a simulated high-altitude (over 5500 m) hypobaric hypoxia mouse model with the activation of the hypoxia response in mouse peripheral blood and multiple tissues. RNase digestion experiments revealed that the alteration of RNA modification abundance under hypoxia exposure impacted the molecular stability of tissue total tRNA-enriched fragments and isolated individual tRNAs, such as tRNAAla, tRNAval, tRNAGlu, and tRNALeu. In vitro transfection experiments showed that the transfection of testis total tRNA-enriched fragments from the hypoxia group into GC-2spd cells attenuated the cell proliferation rate and led to a reduction in overall nascent protein synthesis in cells.Our results reveal that the abundance of RNA modifications for different classes of RNAs under physiological conditions is tissue-specific and responds to hypobaric hypoxia exposure in a tissue-specific manner. Mechanistically, the dysregulation of tRNA modifications under hypobaric hypoxia attenuated the cell proliferation rate, facilitated the sensitivity of tRNA to RNases, and led to a reduction in overall nascent protein synthesis, suggesting an active role of tRNA epitranscriptome alteration in the adaptive response to environmental hypoxia exposure.© 2023.

We harmonized 8,613 RNA-sequencing samples from 14 brain datasets to create the MetaBrain resource and performed cis- and trans-expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) meta-analyses in multiple brain region- and ancestry-specific datasets (n ≤ 2,759). Many of the 16,169 cortex cis-eQTLs were tissue-dependent when compared with blood cis-eQTLs. We inferred brain cell types for 3,549 cis-eQTLs by interaction analysis. We prioritized 186 cis-eQTLs for 31 brain-related traits using Mendelian randomization and co-localization including 40 cis-eQTLs with an inferred cell type, such as a neuron-specific cis-eQTL (CYP24A1) for multiple sclerosis. We further describe 737 trans-eQTLs for 526 unique variants and 108 unique genes. We used brain-specific gene-co-regulation networks to link GWAS loci and prioritize additional genes for five central nervous system diseases. This study represents a valuable resource for post-GWAS research on central nervous system diseases.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36819664","The shared genetic landscape of blood cell traits and risk of neurological and psychiatric disorders.","Cell Genom","Phenotypic associations have been reported between blood cell traits (BCTs) and a range of neurological and psychiatric disorders (NPDs), but in most cases, it remains unclear whether these associations have a genetic basis and, if so, to what extent genetic correlations reflect causality. Here, we report genetic correlations and Mendelian randomization analyses between 11 NPDs and 29 BCTs, using genome-wide association study summary statistics. We found significant genetic correlations for four BCT-NPD pairs, all of which have prior evidence for a phenotypic correlation. We identified a previously unreported causal effect of increased platelet distribution width on susceptibility to Parkinson's disease. We identified multiple functional genes and regulatory elements for specific BCT-NPD pairs, some of which are targets of known drugs. These results enrich our understanding of the shared genetic landscape underlying BCTs and NPDs and provide a robust foundation for future work to improve prognosis and treatment of common NPDs.© 2023 The Authors."
"36778285","Population analyses of mosaic X chromosome loss identify genetic drivers and widespread signatures of cellular selection.","medRxiv","Mosaic loss of the X chromosome (mLOX) is the most commonly occurring clonal somatic alteration detected in the leukocytes of women, yet little is known about its genetic determinants or phenotypic consequences. To address this, we estimated mLOX in >900,000 women across eight biobanks, identifying 10% of women with detectable X loss in approximately 2% of their leukocytes. Out of 1,253 diseases examined, women with mLOX had an elevated risk of myeloid and lymphoid leukemias and pneumonia. Genetic analyses identified 49 common variants influencing mLOX, implicating genes with established roles in chromosomal missegregation, cancer predisposition, and autoimmune diseases. Complementary exome-sequence analyses identified rare missense variants inFBXO10which confer a two-fold increased risk of mLOX. A small fraction of these associations were shared with mosaic Y chromosome loss in men, suggesting different biological processes drive the formation and clonal expansion of sex chromosome missegregation events. Allelic shift analyses identified alleles on the X chromosome which are preferentially retained, demonstrating that variation at many loci across the X chromosome is under cellular selection. A novel polygenic score including 44 independent X chromosome allelic shift loci correctly inferred the retained X chromosomes in 80.7% of mLOX cases in the top decile. Collectively our results support a model where germline variants predispose women to acquiring mLOX, with the allelic content of the X chromosome possibly shaping the magnitude of subsequent clonal expansion."
"36778051","Multi-ancestry meta-analysis of asthma identifies novel associations and highlights the value of increased power and diversity.","Cell Genom","Asthma is a complex disease that varies widely in prevalence across populations. The extent to which genetic variation contributes to these disparities is unclear, as the genetics underlying asthma have been investigated primarily in populations of European descent. As part of the Global Biobank Meta-analysis Initiative, we conducted a large-scale genome-wide association study of asthma (153,763 cases and 1,647,022 controls) via meta-analysis across 22 biobanks spanning multiple ancestries. We discovered 179 asthma-associated loci, 49 of which were not previously reported. Despite the wide range in asthma prevalence among biobanks, we found largely consistent genetic effects across biobanks and ancestries. The meta-analysis also improved polygenic risk prediction in non-European populations compared with previous studies. Additionally, we found considerable genetic overlap between age-of-onset subtypes and between asthma and comorbid diseases. Our work underscores the multi-factorial nature of asthma development and offers insight into its shared genetic architecture.© 2022 The Author(s)."
"36759515","Genome-wide association study using whole-genome sequencing identifies risk loci for Parkinson's disease in Chinese population.","NPJ Parkinsons Dis","Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified numerous susceptibility loci for Parkinson's disease (PD), but its genetic architecture remains underexplored in populations of non-European ancestry. To identify genetic variants associated with PD in the Chinese population, we performed a GWAS using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) in 1,972 cases and 2,478 controls, and a replication study in a total of 8209 cases and 9454 controls. We identified one new risk variant rs61204179 (Pcombined = 1.47 × 10-9) with low allele frequency, four previously reported risk variants (NUCKS1/RAB29-rs11557080, SNCA-rs356182, FYN-rs997368, and VPS13C-rs2251086), as well as three risk variants in LRRK2 coding region (A419V, R1628P, and G2385R) with genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10-8) for PD in Chinese population. Moreover, of the reported genome-wide significant risk variants found mostly in European ancestry populations, the correlation coefficient (rb) of effect size accounting for sampling errors was 0.91 between datasets and 63.6% attained P < 0.05 in Chinese population. Accordingly, we estimated a heritability of 0.14-0.18 for PD, and a moderate genetic correlation between European ancestry and Chinese populations (rg = 0.47, se = 0.21). Polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis revealed that individuals with PRS values in the highest quartile had a 3.9-fold higher risk of developing PD than the lowest quartile. In conclusion, the present GWAS identified PD-associated variants in Chinese population, as well as genetic factors shared among distant populations. Our findings shed light on the genetic homogeneity and heterogeneity of PD in different ethnic groups and suggested WGS might continue to improve our understanding of the genetic architecture of PD.© 2023.

"36757925","GWAS on retinal vasculometry phenotypes.","PLoS Genet","The eye is the window through which light is transmitted and visual sensory signalling originates. It is also a window through which elements of the cardiovascular and nervous systems can be directly inspected, using ophthalmoscopy or retinal imaging. Measurements of ocular parameters may therefore offer important information on the physiology and homeostasis of these two important systems. Here we report the results of a genetic characterisation of retinal vasculature. Four genome-wide association studies performed on different aspects of retinal vasculometry phenotypes, such as arteriolar and venular tortuosity and width, found significant similarities between retinal vascular characteristics and cardiometabolic health. Our analyses identified 119 different regions of association with traits of retinal vasculature, including 89 loci associated arteriolar tortuosity, the strongest of which was rs35131825 (p = 2.00×10-108), 2 loci with arteriolar width (rs12969347, p = 3.30×10-09 and rs5442, p = 1.9E-15), 17 other loci associated with venular tortuosity and 11 novel associations with venular width. Our causal inference analyses also found that factors linked to arteriolar tortuosity cause elevated diastolic blood pressure and not vice versa.Copyright: © 2023 Jiang et al.

"36864135","Genome-wide analysis identifies genetic effects on reproductive success and ongoing natural selection at the FADS locus.","Nat Hum Behav","Identifying genetic determinants of reproductive success may highlight mechanisms underlying fertility and identify alleles under present-day selection. Using data in 785,604 individuals of European ancestry, we identified 43 genomic loci associated with either number of children ever born (NEB) or childlessness. These loci span diverse aspects of reproductive biology, including puberty timing, age at first birth, sex hormone regulation, endometriosis and age at menopause. Missense variants in ARHGAP27 were associated with higher NEB but shorter reproductive lifespan, suggesting a trade-off at this locus between reproductive ageing and intensity. Other genes implicated by coding variants include PIK3IP1, ZFP82 and LRP4, and our results suggest a new role for the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) in reproductive biology. As NEB is one component of evolutionary fitness, our identified associations indicate loci under present-day natural selection. Integration with data from historical selection scans highlighted an allele in the FADS1/2 gene locus that has been under selection for thousands of years and remains so today. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that a broad range of biological mechanisms contribute to reproductive success.© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited."

Genetic variation atSORCS3is associated with multiple neuropsychiatric disorders and behavioural phenotypes. Here, we undertake a systematic search of published genome-wide association studies to identify and catalogue associations betweenSORCS3and brain-related disorders and traits. We also generate aSORCS3gene-set based on protein-protein interactions and investigate the contribution of this gene-set to the heritability of these phenotypes and its overlap with synaptic biology. Analysis of association signals atSORSC3showed individual SNPs to be associated with multiple neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental brain-related disorders and traits that have an impact on the experience of feeling, emotion or mood or cognitive function, while multiple LD-independent SNPs were associated with the same phenotypes. Across these SNPs, alleles associated with the more favourable outcomes for each phenotype (e.g., decreased risk of neuropsychiatric illness) were associated with increased expression of theSORCS3gene. TheSORCS3gene-set was enriched for heritability contributing to schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BPD), intelligence (IQ) and education attainment (EA). Eleven genes from theSORCS3gene-set were associated with more than one of these phenotypes at the genome-wide level, withRBFOX1associated with SCZ, IQ and EA. Functional annotation revealed that theSORCS3gene-set is enriched for multiple ontologies related to the structure and function of synapses. Overall, we find many independent association signals atSORCS3with brain-related disorders and traits, with the effect possibly mediated by reduced gene expression, resulting in a negative impact on synaptic function."
"36800925","Genetics of migraine: where are we now?","J Headache Pain","Migraine is a complex brain disorder explained by the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. In monogenic migraines, including familial hemiplegic migraine and migraine with aura associated with hereditary small-vessel disorders, the identified genes code for proteins expressed in neurons, glial cells, or vessels, all of which increase susceptibility to cortical spreading depression. The study of monogenic migraines has shown that the neurovascular unit plays a prominent role in migraine. Genome-wide association studies have identified numerous susceptibility variants that each result in only a small increase in overall migraine risk. The more than 180 known variants belong to several complex networks of ""pro-migraine"" molecular abnormalities, which are mainly neuronal or vascular. Genetics has also highlighted the importance of shared genetic factors between migraine and its major co-morbidities, including depression and high blood pressure. Further studies are still needed to map all of the susceptibility loci for migraine and then to understand how these genomic variants lead to migraine cell phenotypes.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36797366","Genetics of sexually dimorphic adipose distribution in humans.","Nat Genet","Obesity-associated morbidity is exacerbated by abdominal obesity, which can be measured as the waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for the body mass index (WHRadjBMI). Here we identify genes associated with obesity and WHRadjBMI and characterize allele-sensitive enhancers that are predicted to regulate WHRadjBMI genes in women. We found that several waist-to-hip ratio-associated variants map within primate-specific Alu retrotransposons harboring a DNA motif associated with adipocyte differentiation. This suggests that a genetic component of adipose distribution in humans may involve co-option of retrotransposons as adipose enhancers. We evaluated the role of the strongest female WHRadjBMI-associated gene, SNX10, in adipose biology. We determined that it is required for human adipocyte differentiation and function and participates in diet-induced adipose expansion in female mice, but not males. Our data identify genes and regulatory mechanisms that underlie female-specific adipose distribution and mediate metabolic dysfunction in women.© 2023.

"36711677","Nuclear genetic control of mtDNA copy number and heteroplasmy in humans.","medRxiv","Human mitochondria contain a high copy number, maternally transmitted genome (mtDNA) that encodes 13 proteins required for oxidative phosphorylation. Heteroplasmy arises when multiple mtDNA variants co-exist in an individual and can exhibit complex dynamics in disease and in aging. As all proteins involved in mtDNA replication and maintenance are nuclear-encoded, heteroplasmy levels can, in principle, be under nuclear genetic control, however this has never been shown in humans. Here, we develop algorithms to quantify mtDNA copy number (mtCN) and heteroplasmy levels using blood-derived whole genome sequences from 274,832 individuals of diverse ancestry and perform GWAS to identify nuclear loci controlling these traits. After careful correction for blood cell composition, we observe that mtCN declines linearly with age and is associated with 92 independent nuclear genetic loci. We find that nearly every individual carries heteroplasmic variants that obey two key patterns: (1) heteroplasmic single nucleotide variants are somatic mutations that accumulate sharply after age 70, while (2) heteroplasmic indels are maternally transmitted as mtDNA mixtures with resulting levels influenced by 42 independent nuclear loci involved in mtDNA replication, maintenance, and novel pathways. These nuclear loci do not appear to act by mtDNA mutagenesis, but rather, likely act by conferring a replicative advantage to specific mtDNA molecules. As an illustrative example, the most common heteroplasmy we identify is a length variant carried by >50% of humans at position m.302 within a G-quadruplex known to serve as a replication switch. We find that this heteroplasmic variant exertscis-acting genetic control over mtDNA abundance and is itself undertrans-acting genetic control of nuclear loci encoding protein components of this regulatory switch. Our study showcases how nuclear haplotype can privilege the replication of specific mtDNA molecules to shape mtCN and heteroplasmy dynamics in the human population."

Here, we present a genome-wide association study meta-analysis of ADHD comprising 38,691 individuals with ADHD and 186,843 controls. We identified 27 genome-wide significant loci, highlighting 76 potential risk genes enriched among genes expressed particularly in early brain development. Overall, ADHD genetic risk was associated with several brain-specific neuronal subtypes and midbrain dopaminergic neurons. In exome-sequencing data from 17,896 individuals, we identified an increased load of rare protein-truncating variants in ADHD for a set of risk genes enriched with probable causal common variants, potentially implicating SORCS3 in ADHD by both common and rare variants. Bivariate Gaussian mixture modeling estimated that 84-98% of ADHD-influencing variants are shared with other psychiatric disorders. In addition, common-variant ADHD risk was associated with impaired complex cognition such as verbal reasoning and a range of executive functions, including attention.© 2023.

"36699451","Genome-wide imputed differential expression enrichment analysis identifies trait-relevant tissues.","Front Genet","The identification of pathogenically-relevant genes and tissues for complex traits can be a difficult task. We developed an approach named genome-wide imputed differential expression enrichment (GIDEE), to prioritise trait-relevant tissues by combining genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistic data with tissue-specific expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data from 49 GTEx tissues. Our GIDEE approach analyses robustly imputed gene expression and tests for enrichment of differentially expressed genes in each tissue. Two tests (mean squared z-score and empirical Brown's method) utilise the full distribution of differential expressionp-values across all genes, while two binomial tests assess the proportion of genes with tissue-wide significant differential expression. GIDEE was applied to nine training datasets with known trait-relevant tissues and ranked 49 GTEx tissues using the individual and combined enrichment tests. The best-performing enrichment test produced an average rank of 1.55 out of 49 for the known trait-relevant tissue across the nine training datasets-ranking the correct tissue first five times, second three times, and third once. Subsequent application of the GIDEE approach to 20 test datasets-whose pathogenic tissues or cell types are uncertain or unknown-provided important prioritisation of tissues relevant to the trait's regulatory architecture. GIDEE prioritisation may thus help identify both pathogenic tissues and suitable proxy tissue/cell models (e.g., using enriched tissues/cells that are more easily accessible). The application of our GIDEE approach to GWAS datasets will facilitate follow-upin silicoandin vitroresearch to determine the functional consequence(s) of their risk loci.Copyright © 2023 Ghaffar and Nyholt."
"36683855","Cell type-specific histone acetylation profiling of Alzheimer's disease subjects and integration with genetics.","Front Mol Neurosci","We profile genome-wide histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) of 3 major brain cell types from hippocampus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) of subjects with and without Alzheimer's Disease (AD). We confirm that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with late onset AD (LOAD) show a strong tendency to reside in microglia-specific gene regulatory elements. Despite this significant colocalization, we find that microglia harbor more acetylation changes associated with age than with amyloid-β (Aβ) load. In contrast, we detect that an oligodendrocyte-enriched glial (OEG) population contains the majority of differentially acetylated peaks associated with Aβ load. These differential peaks reside near both early onset risk genes (APP, PSEN1, PSEN2) and late onset AD risk loci (includingBIN1, PICALM, CLU, ADAM10, ADAMTS4, SORL1, FERMT2), Aβ processing genes (BACE1), as well as genes involved in myelinating and oligodendrocyte development processes. Interestingly, a number of LOAD risk loci associated with differentially acetylated risk genes contain H3K27ac peaks that are specifically enriched in OEG. These findings implicate oligodendrocyte gene regulation as a potential mechanism by which early onset and late onset risk genes mediate their effects, and highlight the deregulation of myelinating processes in AD. More broadly, our dataset serves as a resource for the study of functional effects of genetic variants and cell type specific gene regulation in AD.Copyright © 2023 Ramamurthy, Welch, Cheng, Yuan, Gunsalus, Bennett, Tsai and Pfenning."
"36829244","The genetic and evolutionary basis of gene expression variation in East Africans.","Genome Biol","Mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with molecular phenotypes is a powerful approach for identifying the genes and molecular mechanisms underlying human traits and diseases, though most studies have focused on individuals of European descent. While important progress has been made to study a greater diversity of human populations, many groups remain unstudied, particularly among indigenous populations within Africa. To better understand the genetics of gene regulation in East Africans, we perform expression and splicing QTL mapping in whole blood from a cohort of 162 diverse Africans from Ethiopia and Tanzania. We assess replication of these QTLs in cohorts of predominantly European ancestry and identify candidate genes under selection in human populations.We find the gene regulatory architecture of African and non-African populations is broadly shared, though there is a considerable amount of variation at individual loci across populations. Comparing our analyses to an equivalently sized cohort of European Americans, we find that QTL mapping in Africans improves the detection of expression QTLs and fine-mapping of causal variation. Integrating our QTL scans with signatures of natural selection, we find several genes related to immunity and metabolism that are highly differentiated between Africans and non-Africans, as well as a gene associated with pigmentation.Extending QTL mapping studies beyond European ancestry, particularly to diverse indigenous populations, is vital for a complete understanding of the genetic architecture of human traits and can reveal novel functional variation underlying human traits and disease.© 2023.

GBMI meta-analyzes summary statistics from GWASs generated using harmonized genotypes and phenotypes from member biobanks for 14 exemplar diseases and endpoints. This strategy validates that GWASs conducted in diverse biobanks can be integrated despite heterogeneity in case definitions, recruitment strategies, and baseline characteristics.

"36747759","Impact of cross-ancestry genetic architecture on GWAS in admixed populations.","bioRxiv","Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of variants for disease risk. These studies have predominantly been conducted in individuals of European ancestries, which raises questions about their transferability to individuals of other ancestries. Of particular interest are admixed populations, usually defined as populations with recent ancestry from two or more continental sources. Admixed genomes contain segments of distinct ancestries that vary in composition across individuals in the population, allowing for the same allele to induce risk for disease on different ancestral backgrounds. This mosaicism raises unique challenges for GWAS in admixed populations, such as the need to correctly adjust for population stratification to balance type I error with statistical power. In this work we quantify the impact of differences in estimated allelic effect sizes for risk variants between ancestry backgrounds on association statistics. Specifically, while the possibility of estimated allelic effect-size heterogeneity by ancestry (HetLanc) can be modeled when performing GWAS in admixed populations, the extent of HetLanc needed to overcome the penalty from an additional degree of freedom in the association statistic has not been thoroughly quantified. Using extensive simulations of admixed genotypes and phenotypes we find that modeling HetLanc in its absence reduces statistical power by up to 72%. This finding is especially pronounced in the presence of allele frequency differentiation. We replicate simulation results using 4,327 African-European admixed genomes from the UK Biobank for 12 traits to find that for most significant SNPs HetLanc is not large enough for GWAS to benefit from modeling heterogeneity."

Cross-ancestry fine-mapping improved the identification of likely causal variants. Prioritizing genes through gene expression and/or chromatin interaction in brain tissues identified multiple genes associated with PAU. We identified existing medications for potential pharmacological studies by drug repurposing analysis. Cross-ancestry polygenic risk scores (PRS) showed better performance in independent sample than single-ancestry PRS. Genetic correlations between PAU and other traits were observed in multiple ancestries, with other substance use traits having the highest correlations. The analysis of diverse ancestries contributed significantly to the findings, and fills an important gap in the literature."
"36689559","Decomposing heritability and genetic covariance by direct and indirect effect paths.","PLoS Genet","Estimation of heritability and genetic covariance is crucial for quantifying and understanding complex trait genetic architecture and is employed in almost all recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, many existing approaches for heritability estimation and almost all methods for estimating genetic correlation ignore the presence of indirect genetic effects, i.e., genotype-phenotype associations confounded by the parental genome and family environment, and may thus lead to incorrect interpretation especially for human sociobehavioral phenotypes. In this work, we introduce a statistical framework to decompose heritability and genetic covariance into multiple components representing direct and indirect effect paths. Applied to five traits in UK Biobank, we found substantial involvement of indirect genetic components in shared genetic architecture across traits. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and highlight the importance of accounting for indirect effects in variance component analysis of complex traits.Copyright: © 2023 Song et al.

However, commonly used mean-based total mediation effect measures may suffer from cancellation of component-wise mediation effects of opposite directions in the presence of high-dimensional omics mediators. To overcome this limitation, a variance-based R-squared total mediation effect measure has been recently proposed, which, nevertheless, relies on the computationally intensive nonparametric bootstrap for confidence interval estimation. In this work, we formulate a more efficient two-stage cross-fitted estimation procedure for the R-squared measure. To avoid potential bias, we perform iterative Sure Independence Screening (iSIS) in two subsamples to exclude the non-mediators, followed by ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions for the variance estimation. We then construct confidence intervals based on the newly-derived closed-form asymptotic distribution of the R-squared measure. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed procedure is hundreds of times more computationally efficient than the resampling-based method with comparable coverage probability. Furthermore, when applied to the Framingham Heart Study, the proposed method replicated the established finding of gene expression mediating age-related variation in systolic blood pressure and discovered the role of gene expression profiles in the relationship between sex and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The proposed cross-fitted interval estimation procedure is implemented in R package RsqMed ."

The sexual dimorphism of the prefrontal cortex was noted, and we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to identify specific genes or pathways responsible for sexually dimorphic responses to stress. We then performed quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to verify the results of RNA-Seq.Female rats exposed to either UMS or RS showed no negative effects on anxiety-like behaviours, whereas the emotional functions of the PFC were impaired markedly in stressed male rats. Leveraging differentially expressed genes (DEG) analyses, we identified sex-specific transcriptional profiles associated with stress. There were many overlapping DEGs between UMS and RS transcriptional data sets, where 1406 DEGs were associated with both biological sex and stress, while only 117 DEGs were related to stress. Notably,Uba52andRpl34-ps1were the first-ranked hub gene in 1406 and 117 DEGs respectively, andUba52was higher thanRp134-ps1, suggesting that stress may have led to a more pronounced effect on the set of 1406 DEGs. Pathway analysis revealed that 1406 DEGs were primarily enriched in ribosomal pathway. These results were confirmed by qRT-PCR.Sex-specific transcriptional profiles associated with stress were identified in this study, but more in-depth experiments, such as single-cell sequencing and manipulation of male and female gene networks in vivo, are needed to verify our findings.Our findings show sex-specific behavioural responses to stress and highlight sexual dimorphism at the transcriptional level, shedding light on developing sex-specific therapeutic strategies for stress-related psychiatric disorders.© 2023 CMA Impact Inc. or its licensors."

Among male MDD patients with abnormal glucose metabolism, TC was positively correlated with HAMD score, TSH and TgAb levels, but negatively correlated with PANSS positive subscale scores. LDL-C was positively correlated with TSH and BMI, but negatively correlated with PANSS positive subscale scores. HDL-C was negatively correlated with TSH levels. Among females, TC was positively correlated with HAMD score, TSH, and BMI, but negatively correlated with PANSS positive subscale score.

"36781900","Identification of novel targets and pathways to distinguish suicide dependent or independent on depression diagnosis.","Sci Rep","In recent years, postmortem brain studies have revealed that some molecular, cellular, and circuit changes associated with suicide, have an independent or additive effect on depression. The aim of the present study is to identify potential phenotypic, tissue, and sex-specific novel targets and pathways to distinguish depression or suicide from major depressive disorder (MDD) comorbid with suicide. The mRNA expression profiling datasets from two previous independent postmortem brain studies of suicide and depression (GSE102556 and GSE101521) were retrieved from the GEO database. Machine learning analysis was used to differentiate three regrouped gene expression profiles, i.e., MDD with suicide, MDD without suicide, and suicide without depression. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) was further conducted to identify the key modules and hub genes significantly associated with each of these three sub-phenotypes. TissueEnrich approaches were used to find the essential brain tissues and the difference of tissue enriched genes between depression with or without suicide. Dysregulated gene expression cross two variables, including phenotypes and tissues, were determined by global analysis with Vegan. RRHO analysis was applied to examine the difference in global expression pattern between male and female groups. Using the optimized machine learning model, several ncRNAs and mRNAs with higher AUC and MeanDecreaseGini, including GCNT1P1 and AC092745.1, etc., were identified as potential molecular targets to distinguish suicide with, or without MDD and depression without suicide. WGCNA analysis identified some key modules significantly associated with these three phenotypes, and the gene biological functions of the key modules mainly relate to ncRNA and miRNA processing, as well as oxidoreductase and dehydrogenase activity. Hub genes such as RP11-349A22.5, C20orf196, MAPK8IP3 and RP11-697N18.2 were found in these key modules. TissueEnrich analysis showed that nucleus accumbens and subiculum were significantly changed among the 6 brain regions studied. Global analysis with Vegan and RRHO identified PRS26, ARNT and SYN3 as the most significantly differentially expressed genes across phenotype and tissues, and there was little overlap between the male and female groups. In this study, we have identified novel gene targets, as well as annotated functions of co-expression patterns and hub genes that are significantly distinctive between depression with suicide, depression without suicide, and suicide without depression. Moreover, global analysis across three phenotypes and tissues confirmed the evidence of sex difference in mood disorders.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36780219","NPAS4 in the medial prefrontal cortex mediates chronic social defeat stress-induced anhedonia-like behavior and reductions in excitatory synapses.","Elife","Chronic stress can produce reward system deficits (i.e., anhedonia) and other common symptoms associated with depressive disorders, as well as neural circuit hypofunction in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). However, the molecular mechanisms by which chronic stress promotes depressive-like behavior and hypofrontality remain unclear. We show here that the neuronal activity-regulated transcription factor, NPAS4, in the mPFC is regulated by chronic social defeat stress (CSDS), and it is required in this brain region for CSDS-induced changes in sucrose preference and natural reward motivation in the mice. Interestingly, NPAS4 is not required for CSDS-induced social avoidance or anxiety-like behavior. We also find that mPFC NPAS4 is required for CSDS-induced reductions in pyramidal neuron dendritic spine density, excitatory synaptic transmission, and presynaptic function, revealing a relationship between perturbation in excitatory synaptic transmission and the expression of anhedonia-like behavior in the mice. Finally, analysis of the mice mPFC tissues revealed that NPAS4 regulates the expression of numerous genes linked to glutamatergic synapses and ribosomal function, the expression of upregulated genes in CSDS-susceptible animals, and differentially expressed genes in postmortem human brains of patients with common neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression. Together, our findings position NPAS4 as a key mediator of chronic stress-induced hypofrontal states and anhedonia-like behavior.© 2023, Hughes et al."
"36778505","Peripheral immune-derived matrix metalloproteinase promotes stress susceptibility.","Res Sq","Psychosocial stress has profound effects on the body, including the peripheral immune system and the brain1,2. Although a large number of pre-clinical and clinical studies have linked peripheral immune system alterations to stress-related disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD)3,4,5, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here we show that a peripheral myeloid cell-specific proteinase, matrix metalloproteinase 8 (MMP8), is elevated in serum of subjects with MDD as well as in stress-susceptible (SUS) mice following chronic social defeat stress (CSDS). In mice, we show that this increase leads to alterations in extracellular space and neurophysiological changes in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), thereby altering social behaviour. Using a combination of mass cytometry and single-cell RNA-sequencing, we performed high-dimensional phenotyping of immune cells in circulation and brain and demonstrate that peripheral monocytes are strongly affected by stress. Both peripheral and brain-infiltrating monocytes of SUS mice showed increased Mmp8 expression following CSDS. We further demonstrate that peripheral MMP8 directly infiltrates the NAc parenchyma to control the ultrastructure of the extracellular space. Depleting MMP8 prevented stress-induced social avoidance behaviour and alterations in NAc neurophysiology and extracellular space. Collectively, these data establish a novel mechanism by which peripheral immune factors can affect central nervous system function and behaviour in the context of stress. Targeting specific peripheral immune cell-derived matrix metalloproteinases could constitute novel therapeutic targets for stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders."

Because treatment responses in clinical depression are heterogeneous, it is crucial to examine treatment responders and nonresponders in preclinical studies.We used the large variance in behavioral responses to long-term treatment with multiple classes of antidepressant drugs in different inbred mouse strains and classified the mice into responders and nonresponders based on their response in the forced swim test. Medial prefrontal cortex tissues were subjected to RNA sequencing to identify molecules that are consistently associated across antidepressant responders. We developed and used virus-mediated gene transfer to induce the gene of interest in specific cell types and performed forced swim, sucrose preference, social interaction, and open field tests to investigate antidepressant-like and anxiety-like behaviors.Cartptexpression was consistently upregulated in responders to four types of antidepressants but not in nonresponders in different mice strains. Responder mice given a single dose of ketamine, a fast-acting non-monoamine-based antidepressant, exhibited high CART peptide expression. CART peptide overexpression in the GABAergic (gamma-aminobutyric acidergic) neurons of the anterior cingulate cortex led to antidepressant-like behavior and drove chronic stress resiliency independently of mouse genetic background.These data demonstrate that activation of CART peptide signaling in GABAergic neurons of the anterior cingulate cortex is a common molecular mechanism across antidepressant responders and that this pathway also drives stress resilience.© 2022 The Authors."
"36639069","An insight into the sprawling microverse of microRNAs in depression pathophysiology and treatment response.","Neurosci Biobehav Rev","Stress-related neuropathologies are pivotal in developing major depressive disorder (MDD) and are often governed by gene-regulatory changes. Being a stress-responsive gene-regulatory factor, microRNAs (miRNAs) have tremendous biomolecular potential to define an altered gene-regulatory landscape in the MDD brain. MiRNAs' regulatory roles in the MDD brain are closely aligned with changes in plasticity, neurogenesis, and stress-axis functions. MiRNAs act at the epigenetic interface between stress-induced environmental stimuli and cellular pathologies by triggering large-scale gene expression changes in a highly coordinated fashion. The parallel changes in peripheral circulation may provide an excellent opportunity for miRNA to devise more effective treatment strategies and help explore their potential as biomarkers in treatment response. This review discusses the role of miRNAs as epigenetic modifiers in the etiopathogenesis of MDD. Concurrently, key research is highlighted to show the progress in using miRNAs as predictive biomarkers for treatment response.Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

"36711575","Phenotypic subtyping via contrastive learning.","bioRxiv","Defining and accounting for subphenotypic structure has the potential to increase statistical power and provide a deeper understanding of the heterogeneity in the molecular basis of complex disease. Existing phenotype subtyping methods primarily rely on clinically observed heterogeneity or metadata clustering. However, they generally tend to capture the dominant sources of variation in the data, which often originate from variation that is not descriptive of the mechanistic heterogeneity of the phenotype of interest; in fact, such dominant sources of variation, such as population structure or technical variation, are, in general, expected to be independent of subphenotypic structure. We instead aim to find a subspace with signal that is unique to a group of samples for which we believe that subphenotypic variation exists (e.g., cases of a disease). To that end, we introduce Phenotype Aware Components Analysis (PACA), a contrastive learning approach leveraging canonical correlation analysis to robustly capture weak sources of subphenotypic variation. In the context of disease, PACA learns a gradient of variation unique to cases in a given dataset, while leveraging control samples for accounting for variation and imbalances of biological and technical confounders between cases and controls. We evaluated PACA using an extensive simulation study, as well as on various subtyping tasks using genotypes, transcriptomics, and DNA methylation data. Our results provide multiple strong evidence that PACA allows us to robustly capture weak unknown variation of interest while being calibrated and well-powered, far superseding the performance of alternative methods. This renders PACA as a state-of-the-art tool for definingde novosubtypes that are more likely to reflect molecular heterogeneity, especially in challenging cases where the phenotypic heterogeneity may be masked by a myriad of strong unrelated effects in the data.PACA is available as an open source R package on GitHub: https://github.com/Adigorla/PACA."
"36767023","A Deep Learning Approach to Predict Chronological Age.","Healthcare (Basel)","Recently, researchers have turned their focus to predicting the age of people since numerous applications depend on facial recognition approaches. In the medical field, Alzheimer's disease mainly depends on patients' ages. Multiple methods have been implemented and developed to predict age. However, these approaches lack accuracy because every image has unique features, such as shape, pose, and scale. In Saudi Arabia, Vision 2030, concerning the quality of life, is one of the twelve initiatives that were launched recently. The health sector has gained increasing attention as the government has introduced age-based policies to improve the health of its elderly residents. These residents are urgently advised to vaccinate against COVID-19 based on their age. In this paper, proposing a practical, consistent, and trustworthy method to predict age is presented. This method uses the color intensity of eyes and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict age in real time based on the ensemble of CNN. A segmentation algorithm is engaged since the approach takes its input from a video stream or an image. This algorithm extracts data from one of the essential parts of the face: the eyes. This part is also informative. Several experiments have been conducted on MATLAB to verify and validate results and relative errors. A Kaggle website dataset is utilized for ages 4 to 59. This dataset includes over 270,000 images, and its size is roughly 2 GB. Consequently, the proposed approach produces ±8.69 years of Mean Square Error (MSE) for the predicted ages. Lastly, a comparative evaluation of relevant studies and the presented algorithm in terms of accuracy, MSE, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is also provided. This evaluation shows that the approach developed in the current study outperforms all considered performance metrics since its accuracy is 97.29%. This study found that the color intensity of eyes is highly effective in predicting age, given the high accuracy and acceptable MSE and MAE results. This indicates that it is helpful to utilize this methodology in real-life applications."

Here, we performed a 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) APA TWAS (3'aTWAS) for 11 brain disorders by combining their genome-wide association studies data with 17,300 RNA-seq samples across 2,937 individuals. We identified 354 3'aTWAS-significant genes, including known APA-linked risk genes, such as SNCA in Parkinson's disease. Among these 354 genes, ~57% are not significant in traditional expression- and splicing-TWAS studies, since APA may regulate the translation, localization and protein-protein interaction of the target genes independent of mRNA level expression or splicing. Furthermore, we discovered ATXN3 as a 3'aTWAS-significant gene for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and its modulation substantially impacted pathological hallmarks of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in vitro. Together, 3'aTWAS is a powerful strategy to nominate important APA-linked brain disorder susceptibility genes, most of which are largely overlooked by conventional expression and splicing analyses.© 2023.

Through systematic investigation of autoimmune disease pleiotropic loci, we found most of these shared genetic effects are transmitted from regulatory code. We used an evidence-based strategy to functionally prioritize causal pleiotropic variants and identify their target genes. A top-ranked pleiotropic variant, rs4728142, yielded many lines of evidence as being causal. Mechanistically, the rs4728142-containing region interacts with the IRF5 alternative promoter in an allele-specific manner and orchestrates its upstream enhancer to regulate IRF5 alternative promoter usage through chromatin looping. A putative structural regulator, ZBTB3, mediates the allele-specific loop to promote IRF5-short transcript expression at the rs4728142 risk allele, resulting in IRF5 overactivation and M1 macrophage polarization. Together, our findings establish a causal mechanism between the regulatory variant and fine-scale molecular phenotype underlying the dysfunction of pleiotropic genes in human autoimmunity.© 2023.

Marine midges of the genusClunio(Diptera) have recolonized Northern European shore areas after the last glaciation. In response to local tide conditions they have formed different ecotypes with respect to timing of adult emergence, oviposition behavior and larval habitat. Genomic analysis confirms the recent establishment of these ecotypes, reflected in massive haplotype sharing between ecotypes, irrespective of whether there is ongoing gene flow or geographic isolation. QTL mapping and genome screens reveal patterns of polygenic adaptation from standing genetic variation. Ecotype-associated loci prominently include circadian clock genes, as well as genes affecting sensory perception and nervous system development, hinting to a central role of these processes in ecotype formation. Our data show that adaptive ecotype formation can occur rapidly, with ongoing gene flow and largely based on a re-assortment of existing alleles.© 2023, Kaiser et al."

Consequently, it is imperative to determine how accurately and effectively any proposed biological surrogate may reflect the biological processes it is assumed to model. One such cellular surrogate of human disease is the established mouse neural precursor cell line, SN4741, which has been used to elucidate mechanisms of neurotoxicity in Parkinson disease for over 25 years. Here, we are using a combination of classic and contemporary genomic techniques - karyotyping, RT-qPCR, single cell RNA-seq, bulk RNA-seq, and ATAC-seq - to characterize the transcriptional landscape, chromatin landscape, and genomic architecture of this cell line, and evaluate its suitability as a proxy for midbrain dopaminergic neurons in the study of Parkinson disease. We find that SN4741 cells possess an unstable triploidy and consistently exhibits low expression of dopaminergic neuron markers across assays, even when the cell line is shifted to the non-permissive temperature that drives differentiation. The transcriptional signatures of SN4741 cells suggest that they are maintained in an undifferentiated state at the permissive temperature and differentiate into immature neurons at the non-permissive temperature; however, they may not be dopaminergic neuron precursors, as previously suggested. Additionally, the chromatin landscapes of SN4741 cells, in both the differentiated and undifferentiated states, are not concordant with the open chromatin profiles ofex vivo, mouse E15.5 forebrain- or midbrain-derived dopaminergic neurons. Overall, our data suggest that SN4741 cells may reflect early aspects of neuronal differentiation but are likely not a suitable a proxy for dopaminergic neurons as previously thought.

Here, we performed network-based expansion of trait-associated genes for 1,002 human traits showing that this recovers known disease genes or drug targets. The similarity of network expansion scores identifies groups of traits likely to share an underlying genetic and biological process. We identified 73 pleiotropic gene modules linked to multiple traits, enriched in genes involved in processes such as protein ubiquitination and RNA processing. In contrast to gene deletion studies, pleiotropy as defined here captures specifically multicellular-related processes. We show examples of modules linked to human diseases enriched in genes with known pathogenic variants that can be used to map targets of approved drugs for repurposing.

Network science approaches associate genetic variables' disease susceptibility to their topological importance in the network. However, this network only represents genetic interactions and does not describe how these interactions attribute to disease association at the subject-scale. We propose the Network-based Subject Portrait Approach (NSPA) and an accompanying feature transformation method to determine the collective risk impact of multiple genetic interactions for each subject.The feature transformation method converts genetic variants of subjects into new values that capture how genetic variables interact with others to attribute to a subject's disease association. We apply this approach to synthetic and genetic datasets and learn that (1) the disease association can be captured using multiple disjoint sets of genetic interactions and (2) the feature transformation method based on NSPA improves predictive performance comparing with using the original genetic variables. Our findings confirm the role of genetic interaction in complex disease and provide a novel approach for gene-disease association studies to identify genetic architecture in the context of epistasis.The codes of NSPA are now available in: https://github.com/MIB-Lab/Network-based-Subject-Portrait-Approach.ting.hu@queensu.ca.Supplementary data are available atBioinformatics Advancesonline.© The Author(s) 2023.

The GO and KEGG analysis results suggested that the mechanism is mainly involved in Fluid shear stress and atherosclerosis and Lipid and atherosclerosis. The molecular docking results indicate a generally strong affinity. The animal experiment showed that THD reduced plaque area, increased plaque stability, and decreased the levels of inflammatory cytokines (NF-κB, IL-1α, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-18, IL-1β) in high-fat diet -induced ApoE-/-mice.

In the framework of diffusion theory, we study the steady state and the adaptation dynamics of a large but finite population evolving under stabilizing selection and symmetric mutations when selection and mutation are moderately large. We find that in the stationary state, the allele frequency distribution at a locus is unimodal if its effect size is below a threshold effect and bimodal otherwise; these results are the stochastic analog of the deterministic ones where the stable allele frequency becomes bistable when the effect size exceeds a threshold. It is known that following a sudden shift in the phenotypic optimum, in an infinitely large population, selective sweeps at a large-effect locus are prevented and adaptation proceeds exclusively via subtle changes in the allele frequency; in contrast, we find that the chance of sweep is substantially enhanced in large, finite populations and the allele frequency at a large-effect locus can reach a high frequency at short times even for small shifts in the phenotypic optimum."

CDA is a complex disease whose polygenic component is mainly unidentified. We propose that levels of intermediate molecular phenotypes in the myocardium associated with histopathological damage could explain CDA susceptibility; so that variants of genes encoding these intermediate molecular phenotypes could identify patients susceptible to this complication. A genetically heterogeneous cohort of mice generated by backcrossing (N = 165) was treated with doxorubicin and docetaxel. Cardiac histopathological damage was measured by fibrosis and cardiomyocyte size by an Ariol slide scanner. We determine intramyocardial levels of intermediate molecular phenotypes of CDA associated with histopathological damage and quantitative trait loci (ipQTLs) linked to them. These ipQTLs seem to contribute to the missing heritability of CDA because they improve the heritability explained by QTL directly linked to CDA (cda-QTLs) through genetic models. Genes encoding these molecular subphenotypes were evaluated as genetic markers of CDA in three cancer patient cohorts (N = 517) whose cardiac damage was quantified by echocardiography or Cardiac Magnetic Resonance. Many SNPs associated with CDA were found using genetic models. LASSO multivariate regression identified two risk score models, one for pediatric cancer patients and the other for women with breast cancer. Molecular intermediate phenotypes associated with heart damage can identify genetic markers of CDA risk, thereby allowing a more personalized patient management. A similar strategy could be applied to identify genetic markers of other complex trait diseases."

However, evolutionary predictions are increasingly being developed and used in medicine, agriculture, biotechnology and conservation biology. Evolutionary predictions may be used for different purposes, such as to prepare for the future, to try and change the course of evolution or to determine how well we understand evolutionary processes. Similarly, the exact aspect of the evolved population that we want to predict may also differ. For example, we could try to predict which genotype will dominate, the fitness of the population or the extinction probability of a population. In addition, there are many uses of evolutionary predictions that may not always be recognized as such. The main goal of this review is to increase awareness of methods and data in different research fields by showing the breadth of situations in which evolutionary predictions are made. We describe how diverse evolutionary predictions share a common structure described by the predictive scope, time scale and precision. Then, by using examples ranging from SARS-CoV2 and influenza to CRISPR-based gene drives and sustainable product formation in biotechnology, we discuss the methods for predicting evolution, the factors that affect predictability and how predictions can be used to prevent evolution in undesirable directions or to promote beneficial evolution (i.e. evolutionary control).

A key aspect is cellular competency, since cells are not passive materials but descendants of unicellular organisms with complex context-sensitive behavioral capabilities. To probe the effects of different degrees of cellular competency on evolutionary dynamics, we used an evolutionary simulation in the context of minimal artificial embryogeny. Virtual embryos consisted of a single axis of positional information values provided by cells' 'structural genes', operated upon by an evolutionary cycle in which embryos' fitness was proportional to monotonicity of the axial gradient. Evolutionary dynamics were evaluated in two modes: hardwired development (genotype directly encodes phenotype), and a more realistic mode in which cells interact prior to evaluation by the fitness function (""regulative"" development). We find that even minimal ability of cells with to improve their position in the embryo results in better performance of the evolutionary search. Crucially, we observed that increasing the behavioral competency masks the raw fitness encoded by structural genes, with selection favoring improvements to its developmental problem-solving capacities over improvements to its structural genome. This suggests the existence of a powerful ratchet mechanism: evolution progressively becomes locked in to improvements in the intelligence of its agential substrate, with reduced pressure on the structural genome. This kind of feedback loop in which evolution increasingly puts more effort into the developmental software than perfecting the hardware explains the very puzzling divergence of genome from anatomy in species like planaria. In addition, it identifies a possible driver for scaling intelligence over evolutionary time, and suggests strategies for engineering novel systems in silico and in bioengineering."

From a rocky start with candidate gene association research, by 2005 the technological advance of DNA microarrays enabled genome-wide association studies, which have successfully identified some of the DNA variants that contribute to the ubiquitous heritability of behavioral traits. The ability to aggregate the effects of thousands of DNA variants in polygenic scores has created a DNA revolution in the behavioral sciences by making it possible to use DNA to predict individual differences in behavior from early in life.© 2023.

"36648331","A unified mediation analysis framework for integrative cancer proteogenomics with clinical outcomes.","Bioinformatics","Multilevel molecular profiling of tumors and the integrative analysis with clinical outcomes have enabled a deeper characterization of cancer treatment. Mediation analysis has emerged as a promising statistical tool to identify and quantify the intermediate mechanisms by which a gene affects an outcome. However, existing methods lack a unified approach to handle various types of outcome variables, making them unsuitable for high-throughput molecular profiling data with highly interconnected variables.We develop a general mediation analysis framework for proteogenomic data that include multiple exposures, multivariate mediators on various scales of effects as appropriate for continuous, binary and survival outcomes. Our estimation method avoids imposing constraints on model parameters such as the rare disease assumption, while accommodating multiple exposures and high-dimensional mediators. We compare our approach to other methods in extensive simulation studies at a range of sample sizes, disease prevalence and number of false mediators. Using kidney renal clear cell carcinoma proteogenomic data, we identify genes that are mediated by proteins and the underlying mechanisms on various survival outcomes that capture short- and long-term disease-specific clinical characteristics.Software is made available in an R package (https://github.com/longjp/mediateR).Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.© The Author(s) 2023.

"36608684","Probabilistic integration of transcriptome-wide association studies and colocalization analysis identifies key molecular pathways of complex traits.","Am J Hum Genet","Integrative genetic association methods have shown great promise in post-GWAS (genome-wide association study) analyses, in which one of the most challenging tasks is identifying putative causal genes and uncovering molecular mechanisms of complex traits. Recent studies suggest that prevailing computational approaches, including transcriptome-wide association studies (TWASs) and colocalization analysis, are individually imperfect, but their joint usage can yield robust and powerful inference results. This paper presents INTACT, a computational framework to integrate probabilistic evidence from these distinct types of analyses and implicate putative causal genes. This procedure is flexible and can work with a wide range of existing integrative analysis approaches. It has the unique ability to quantify the uncertainty of implicated genes, enabling rigorous control of false-positive discoveries. Taking advantage of this highly desirable feature, we further propose an efficient algorithm, INTACT-GSE, for gene set enrichment analysis based on the integrated probabilistic evidence. We examine the proposed computational methods and illustrate their improved performance over the existing approaches through simulation studies. We apply the proposed methods to analyze the multi-tissue eQTL data from the GTEx project and eight large-scale complex- and molecular-trait GWAS datasets from multiple consortia and the UK Biobank. Overall, we find that the proposed methods markedly improve the existing putative gene implication methods and are particularly advantageous in evaluating and identifying key gene sets and biological pathways underlying complex traits.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

"36745672","Day-night and seasonal variation of human gene expression across tissues.","PLoS Biol","Circadian and circannual cycles trigger physiological changes whose reflection on human transcriptomes remains largely uncharted. We used the time and season of death of 932 individuals from GTEx to jointly investigate transcriptomic changes associated with those cycles across multiple tissues. Overall, most variation across tissues during day-night and among seasons was unique to each cycle. Although all tissues remodeled their transcriptomes, brain and gonadal tissues exhibited the highest seasonality, whereas those in the thoracic cavity showed stronger day-night regulation. Core clock genes displayed marked day-night differences across multiple tissues, which were largely conserved in baboon and mouse, but adapted to their nocturnal or diurnal habits. Seasonal variation of expression affected multiple pathways, and it was enriched among genes associated with the immune response, consistent with the seasonality of viral infections. Furthermore, they unveiled cytoarchitectural changes in brain regions. Altogether, our results provide the first combined atlas of how transcriptomes from human tissues adapt to major cycling environmental conditions. This atlas may have multiple applications; for example, drug targets with day-night or seasonal variation in gene expression may benefit from temporally adjusted doses.Copyright: © 2023 Wucher et al.

Due to mitochondria's indispensable role in the body, its dysfunction has been implicated in the development and progression of multiple diseases, including Type 2 Diabetes mellitus. Thus, factors that can regulate mitochondrial function, like mtDNA methylation, are of significant interest in managing T2DM. In this paper, the overview of epigenetics and the mechanism of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA methylation were briefly discussed, followed by other mitochondrial epigenetics. Subsequently, the association between mtDNA methylation with T2DM and the challenges of mtDNA methylation studies were also reviewed.

"36768245","HIV Replication Increases the Mitochondrial DNA Content of Plasma Extracellular Vesicles.","Int J Mol Sci","Extracellular vesicles (EVs) and their cargo have been studied intensively as potential sources of biomarkers in HIV infection; however, their DNA content, particularly the mitochondrial portion (mtDNA), remains largely unexplored. It is well known that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and prolonged antiretroviral therapy (ART) lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced mtDNA copy in cells and tissues. Moreover, mtDNA is a well-known damage-associated molecular pattern molecule that could potentially contribute to increased immune activation, oxidative stress, and inflammatory response. We investigated the mtDNA content of large and small plasma EVs in persons living with HIV (PLWH) and its implications for viral replication, ART use, and immune status. Venous blood was collected from 196 PLWH, ART-treated or ART-naïve (66 with ongoing viral replication, ≥20 copies/mL), and from 53 HIV-negative persons, all recruited at five HIV testing or treatment centers in Burkina Faso. Large and small plasma EVs were purified and counted, and mtDNA level was measured by RT-qPCR. Regardless of HIV status, mtDNA was more abundant in large than small EVs. It was more abundant in EVs of viremic than aviremic and control participants and tended to be more abundant in participants treated with Tenofovir compared with Zidovudine. When ART treatment was longer than six months and viremia was undetectable, no variation in EV mtDNA content versus CD4 and CD8 count or CD4/CD8 ratio was observed. However, mtDNA in large and small EVs decreased with years of HIV infection and ART. Our results highlight the impact of viral replication and ART on large and small EVs' mtDNA content. The mechanisms underlying the differential incorporation of mtDNA into EVs and their effects on the surrounding cells warrant further investigation."
"36778133","Is DNA methylation in the brain a mechanism of alcohol use disorder?","Front Behav Neurosci","Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a worldwide problem. Unfortunately, the molecular mechanisms of alcohol misuse are still poorly understood, therefore successful therapeutic approaches are limited. Accumulating data indicate that the tendency for compulsive alcohol use is inherited, suggesting a genetic background as an important factor. However, the probability to develop AUD is also affected by life experience and environmental factors. Therefore, the epigenetic modifications that are altered over lifetime likely contribute to increased risk of alcohol misuse. Here, we review the literature looking for the link between DNA methylation in the brain, a common epigenetic modification, and AUD-related behaviors in humans, mice and rats. We sum up the main findings, identify the existing gaps in our knowledge and indicate future directions of the research.Copyright © 2023 Jarczak, Miszczak and Radwanska."

Understanding the genetic, developmental and molecular bases for these changes will provide insights into how we became human. Connecting human-specific genetic changes to species differences has been challenging owing to an abundance of low-effect size genetic changes, limited descriptions of phenotypic differences across development at the level of cell types and lack of experimental models. Emerging approaches for single-cell sequencing, genetic manipulation and stem cell culture now support descriptive and functional studies in defined cell types with a human or ape genetic background.

However, it is unclear how genetic variants confer the risk of EM. Here, viaSherlockintegrative analysis, we combined large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics on EM (N = 245,494) with a blood-based eQTL dataset (N = 1490) to identify EM risk-related genes. For validation, we leveraged two independent eQTL datasets (N = 769) for integration with the GWAS data. Thus, we prioritised 14 genes, includingGIMAP4,TOP3A, andNMNAT3, which showed significant association with susceptibility to EM. We also utilised two independent methods, Multi-marker Analysis of GenoMic Annotation and S-PrediXcan, to further validate the EM risk-associated genes. Moreover, protein-protein interaction network analysis showed the 14 genes were functionally connected. Functional enrichment analyses further demonstrated that these genes were significantly enriched in metabolic and immune-related pathways. Differential gene expression analysis showed that in peripheral blood samples from patients with ovarian EM,TOP3A,MKNK1,SIPA1L2, andNUCB1were significantly upregulated, whileHOXB2,GIMAP5, andMGMTwere significantly downregulated compared with their expression levels in samples from the controls. Immunohistochemistry further confirmed the increased expression levels ofMKNK1andTOP3Ain the ectopic and eutopic endometrium compared to normal endometrium, while HOBX2 was downregulated in the endometrium of women with ovarian EM. Finally, inex vivofunctional experiments,MKNK1knockdown inhibited ectopic endometrial stromal cells (EESCs) migration and invasion.TOP3Aknockdown inhibited EESCs proliferation, migration, and invasion, while promoting their apoptosis. Convergent lines of evidence suggested thatMKNK1andTOP3Aare novel EM risk-related genes.© 2023 The Author(s)."

While the focus of the WHO Classification for Central Nervous System (CNS) tumors had historically been on histopathological attributes, the recently released fifth edition of the classification (WHO CNS5) characterizes brain tumors, including gliomas, using an integration of histological and molecular features, including their epigenetic changes such as histone methylation, DNA methylation, and histone acetylation, which are increasingly being used for the classification of low-grade gliomas. This review describes the current understanding of the role of DNA methylation, demethylation, and histone modification in pathogenesis, clinical behavior, and outcomes of brain tumors, in particular of low-grade gliomas. The review also highlights potential diagnostic and/or therapeutic targets in associated cellular biomolecules, structures, and processes. Targeting of MGMT promoter methylation, TET-hTDG-BER pathway, association of G-CIMP with key gene mutations, PARP inhibition, IDH and 2-HG-associated processes, TERT mutation and ARL9-associated pathways, DNA Methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibition, Histone Deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition, BET inhibition, CpG site DNA methylation signatures, along with others, present exciting avenues for translational research. This review also summarizes the current clinical trial landscape associated with the therapeutic utility of epigenetics in low-grade gliomas. Much of the evidence currently remains restricted to preclinical studies, warranting further investigation to demonstrate true clinical utility."

Secondly, univariate and multivariate Cox analysis was executed to filter the prognostic DEBRGs and establish the polygenic model for risk prediction in OS patients with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve weighed the model's accuracy. Thirdly, the GEO database (GSE21257) was operated for independent validation. The nomogram was initiated using multivariable Cox regression. Immune infiltration of the OS sample was calculated. Finally, the three discovered hallmark genes' mRNA and protein expressions were verified.A total of 46 DEBRGs were found in the OS and control samples, and three prognostic DEBRGs (DLX2, TERT, and EVX1) were screened under the LASSO regression analyses. Multivariate and univariate Cox regression analysis were devised to forge the OS risk model. Both the TARGET training and validation sets indicated that the prognostic biomarker-based risk score model performed well based on ROC curves. In high- and low-risk groups, immune cells, including memory B, activated mast, resting mast, plasma, and activated memory CD4 + T cells, and the immune, stromal, and ESTIMATE scores showed significant differences. The nomogram that predicts survival was established with good performance according to clinical features of OS patients and risk scores. Finally, the expression of three crucial BMP-related genes in OS cell lines was investigated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting (WB).The new BMP-related prognostic signature linked to OS can be a new tool to identify biomarkers to detect the disease early and a potential candidate to better treat OS in the future.© 2023.

We have discovered that every circadian clock-controlled output gene (CCG), but not the core clock nor its immediate-output genes, contains a single cognate intronic deoxyCpG-rich island, the demethylation-methylation of which is controlled by the CC. During the transcriptional activation period, these intronic islands are demethylated and, upon dimerization of two YY1 protein binding sites located upstream to the transcriptional enhancer and downstream from the deoxyCpG-rich island, store activating components initially assembled on a cognate active enhancer (a RORE, a D-box or an E-box), in keeping with the generation of a transcriptionally active condensate that boosts the initiation of transcription of their cognate pre-mRNAs. We report how these single intronic deoxyCpG-rich islands are instrumental in such a circadian activation/repression transcriptional process."

We mapped 38,931 cytokine-responsive candidatecis-regulatory elements (cCREs) in beta cells using ATAC-seq and snATAC-seq and linked them to target genes using co-accessibility and HiChIP. Using a genome-wide CRISPR screen in EndoC-βH1 cells, we identified 867 genes affecting cytokine-induced survival, and genes promoting survival and up-regulated in cytokines were enriched at T1D risk loci. Using SNP-SELEX, we identified 2,229 variants in cytokine-responsive cCREs altering transcription factor (TF) binding, and variants altering binding of TFs regulating stress, inflammation, and apoptosis were enriched for T1D risk. At the 16p13 locus, a fine-mapped T1D variant altering TF binding in a cytokine-induced cCRE interacted withSOCS1, which promoted survival in cytokine exposure. Our findings reveal processes and genes acting in beta cells during inflammation that modulate T1D risk.© 2022."

Furthermore, we show that glutamine metabolism is a key regulator of epigenetic modifications in CSC. Finally, we briefly discuss how cancer-associated fibroblasts, adipocytes, and senescent cells in the tumor microenvironment may indirectly influence CSC fate by modulating glutamine availability. We aim to highlight the complexity of glutamine's role in CSC, which supports our knowledge about metabolic heterogeneity within the CSC population."
"36739439","Pivotal role for S-nitrosylation of DNA methyltransferase 3B in epigenetic regulation of tumorigenesis.","Nat Commun","DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) catalyze methylation at the C5 position of cytosine with S-adenosyl-L-methionine. Methylation regulates gene expression, serving a variety of physiological and pathophysiological roles. The chemical mechanisms regulating DNMT enzymatic activity, however, are not fully elucidated. Here, we show that protein S-nitrosylation of a cysteine residue in DNMT3B attenuates DNMT3B enzymatic activity and consequent aberrant upregulation of gene expression. These genes include Cyclin D2 (Ccnd2), which is required for neoplastic cell proliferation in some tumor types. In cell-based and in vivo cancer models, only DNMT3B enzymatic activity, and not DNMT1 or DNMT3A, affects Ccnd2 expression. Using structure-based virtual screening, we discovered chemical compounds that specifically inhibit S-nitrosylation without directly affecting DNMT3B enzymatic activity. The lead compound, designated DBIC, inhibits S-nitrosylation of DNMT3B at low concentrations (IC50 ≤ 100 nM). Treatment with DBIC prevents nitric oxide (NO)-induced conversion of human colonic adenoma to adenocarcinoma in vitro. Additionally, in vivo treatment with DBIC strongly attenuates tumor development in a mouse model of carcinogenesis triggered by inflammation-induced generation of NO. Our results demonstrate that de novo DNA methylation mediated by DNMT3B is regulated by NO, and DBIC protects against tumor formation by preventing aberrant S-nitrosylation of DNMT3B.© 2023.

Determining how, where, and when TFs bind chromatin will advance our understanding of gene regulatory networks and cellular behavior. The 2017 ENCODE-DREAM in vivo Transcription-Factor Binding Site (TFBS) Prediction Challenge highlighted the value of chromatin accessibility data to TFBS prediction, establishing state-of-the-art methods for TFBS prediction from DNase-seq. However, the more recent Assay-for-Transposase-Accessible-Chromatin (ATAC)-seq has surpassed DNase-seq as the most widely-used chromatin accessibility profiling method. Furthermore, ATAC-seq is the only such technique available at single-cell resolution from standard commercial platforms. While ATAC-seq datasets grow exponentially, suboptimal motif scanning is unfortunately the most common method for TFBS prediction from ATAC-seq. To enable community access to state-of-the-art TFBS prediction from ATAC-seq, we (1) curated an extensive benchmark dataset (127 TFs) for ATAC-seq model training and (2) built ""maxATAC"", a suite of user-friendly, deep neural network models for genome-wide TFBS prediction from ATAC-seq in any cell type. With models available for 127 human TFs, maxATAC is the largest collection of high-performance TFBS prediction models for ATAC-seq. maxATAC performance extends to primary cells and single-cell ATAC-seq, enabling improved TFBS prediction in vivo. We demonstrate maxATAC's capabilities by identifying TFBS associated with allele-dependent chromatin accessibility at atopic dermatitis genetic risk loci.Copyright: © 2023 Cazares et al.

We then consider the complex and poorly understood interplay of these diverse elements within regulatory landscapes and its relationships with chromatin states and nuclear organization.

"36690623","Mechanisms and function of de novo DNA methylation in placental development reveals an essential role for DNMT3B.","Nat Commun","DNA methylation is a repressive epigenetic modification that is essential for development, exemplified by the embryonic and perinatal lethality observed in mice lacking de novo DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). Here we characterise the role for DNMT3A, 3B and 3L in gene regulation and development of the mouse placenta. We find that each DNMT establishes unique aspects of the placental methylome through targeting to distinct chromatin features. Loss of Dnmt3b results in de-repression of germline genes in trophoblast lineages and impaired formation of the maternal-foetal interface in the placental labyrinth. Using Sox2-Cre to delete Dnmt3b in the embryo, leaving expression intact in placental cells, the placental phenotype was rescued and, consequently, the embryonic lethality, as Dnmt3b null embryos could now survive to birth. We conclude that de novo DNA methylation by DNMT3B during embryogenesis is principally required to regulate placental development and function, which in turn is critical for embryo survival.© 2023.

The incidence of POF is increasing annually, and POF has become one of the main causes of infertility in women of childbearing age. The etiology and pathogenesis of POF are complex and have not yet been clearly elucidated. In addition to genetic factors, an increasing number of studies have revealed that epigenetic changes play an important role in the occurrence and development of POF. However, we found that very few papers have summarized epigenetic variations in POF, and a systematic analysis of this topic is therefore necessary. In this article, by reviewing and analyzing the most relevant literature in this research field, we expound on the relationship between DNA methylation, histone modification and non-coding RNA expression and the development of POF. We also analyzed how environmental factors affect POF through epigenetic modulation. Additionally, we discuss potential epigenetic biomarkers and epigenetic treatment targets for POF.

"36656856","Physicochemical models of protein-DNA binding with standard and modified base pairs.","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","DNA-binding proteins play important roles in various cellular processes, but the mechanisms by which proteins recognize genomic target sites remain incompletely understood. Functional groups at the edges of the base pairs (bp) exposed in the DNA grooves represent physicochemical signatures. As these signatures enable proteins to form specific contacts between protein residues and bp, their study can provide mechanistic insights into protein-DNA binding. Existing experimental methods, such as X-ray crystallography, can reveal such mechanisms based on physicochemical interactions between proteins and their DNA target sites. However, the low throughput of structural biology methods limits mechanistic insights for selection of many genomic sites. High-throughput binding assays enable prediction of potential target sites by determining relative binding affinities of a protein to massive numbers of DNA sequences. Many currently available computational methods are based on the sequence of standard Watson-Crick bp. They assume that the contribution of overall binding affinity is independent for each base pair, or alternatively include dinucleotides or shortk-mers. These methods cannot directly expand to physicochemical contacts, and they are not suitable to apply to DNA modifications or non-Watson-Crick bp. These variations include DNA methylation, and synthetic or mismatched bp. The proposed method, DeepRec, can predict relative binding affinities as function of physicochemical signatures and the effect of DNA methylation or other chemical modifications on binding. Sequence-based modeling methods are in comparison a coarse-grain description and cannot achieve such insights.

"36645923","Estradiol withdrawal following a hormone simulated pregnancy induces deficits in affective behaviors and increases âˆ†FosB in D1 and D2 neurons in the nucleus accumbens core in mice.","Horm Behav","In placental mammals, estradiol levels are chronically elevated during pregnancy, but quickly drop to prepartum levels following birth. This may produce an ""estrogen withdrawal"" state that has been linked to changes in affective states in humans and rodents during the postpartum period. The neural mechanisms underlying these affective changes, however, are understudied. We used a hormone-simulated pseudopregnancy (HSP), a model of postpartum estrogen withdrawal, in adult female C57BL/6 mice to test the impact of postpartum estradiol withdrawal on several behavioral measures of anxiety and motivation. We found that estradiol withdrawal following HSP increased anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze, but not in the open field or marble burying tests. Although hormone treatment during HSP consistently increased sucrose consumption, sucrose preference was generally not impacted by hormone treatment or subsequent estradiol withdrawal. In the social motivation test, estradiol withdrawal decreased the amount of time spent in proximity to a social stimulus animal. These behavioral changes were accompanied by changes in the expression of ∆FosB, a transcription factor correlated with stable long-term plasticity, in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Specifically, estrogen-withdrawn females had higher ∆FosB expression in the nucleus accumbens core, but ∆FosB expression did not vary across hormone conditions in the nucleus accumbens shell. Using transgenic reporter mice, we found that this increase in ∆FosB occurred in both D1- and D2-expressing cells in the NAc core. Together, these results suggest that postpartum estrogen withdrawal impacts anxiety and motivation and increases ∆FosB in the NAc core.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

This study aimed to investigate the importance of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) as a prognostic marker for long-term survival in patients with mRCC.We retrospectively analysed data from 74 patients with mRCC treated at our medical centre with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). We evaluated the predictive value of NLR for overall survival (OS) in these patients.The median OS was 5.1 months in the higher NLR group (≥3) and 13.3 months in the lower NLR group (<3) (p< 0.0001). There was no significant difference in the OS between the TKI and ICI therapies in the low NLR group (12.9 vs. 13.6 months,p= 0.411) or in the high NLR group (4.7 vs. 5.5 months,p= 0.32). Both univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that a higher NLR was an independent prognostic factor of long-term survival in patients with mRCC treated with first-line therapy.This retrospective study showed that adding NLR to other Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) and International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) variables might improve the prognostic and predictive power of these models."
"36810528","Demographic and Social Patterns of the Mean Values of Inflammatory Markers in U.S. Adults: A 2009-2016 NHANES Analysis.","Diseases","Several studies have reported on the negative implications of elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and elevated platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) levels associated with outcomes in many surgical and medical conditions, including cancer. In order to use the inflammatory markers NLR and PLR as prognostic factors in disease, a normal value in disease-free individuals must be identified first. This study aims (1) to establish mean values of various inflammatory markers using a healthy and nationally representative U.S. adult population and (2) to explore heterogeneity in the mean values by sociodemographic and behavioral risk factors to better specify cutoff points accordingly. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) of aggregated cross-sectional data collected from 2009 to 2016 was analyzed; data extracted included markers of systemic inflammation and demographic variables. We excluded participants who were under 20 years old or had a history of an inflammatory disease such as arthritis or gout. Adjusted linear regression models were used to examine the associations between demographic/behavioral characteristics and neutrophil counts, platelet counts, lymphocyte counts, as well as NLR and PLR values. The national weighted average NLR value is 2.16 and the national weighted average PLR value is 121.31. The national weighted average PLR value for non-Hispanic Whites is 123.12 (121.13-125.11), for non-Hispanic Blacks it is 119.77 (117.49-122.06), for Hispanic people it is 116.33 (114.69-117.97), and for participants of other races it is 119.84 (116.88-122.81). Non-Hispanic Blacks and Blacks have significantly lower mean NLR values (1.78, 95% CI 1.74-1.83 and 2.10, 95% CI 2.04-2.16, respectively) as compared with that of non-Hispanic Whites (2.27, 95% CI 2.22-2.30,p< 0.0001). Subjects who reported a non-smoking history had significantly lower NLR values than subjects who reported any smoking history and higher PLR values than current smokers. This study provides preliminary data for demographic and behavioral effects on markers of inflammation, i.e., NLR and PLR, that have been associated with several chronic disease outcomes, suggesting that different cutoff points should be set according to social factors."

The predictive value of some blood inflammatory composite markers in OC has been extensively reported. They can be used for early detection and differential diagnosis of OC and can be used for predicting survival, treatment response, and recurrence in the affected patients. Here, we reviewed the predictive values of composite inflammatory markers based on complete blood count, namely neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio, and systemic inflammation index and markers based on blood protein, namely C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio and prognostic nutritional index in OC, with a focus on NLR and PLR. We referred to the clinical studies on these six markers, reviewed the patient population, and summarized the marker cut-off values, significance, and limitations of these studies. All these studies were retrospective and most of them were single-center clinical studies with small sample sizes. We found that the cut-off values of these markers have not been unified, and methods used to determine these values varied among studies. The predictive value of these markers on survival was mainly reflected in the postoperative patients of multiple subtypes of ovarian cancer including epithelial OC, high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma, and ovarian clear cell carcinoma. We focused on NLR and PLR and calculated their pooled hazard ratios. NLR and PLR were reliable in predicting overall and progression-free survivals in patients with OC. Therefore, it is necessary to adjust important confounding factors and conduct a long-term follow-up prospective cohort study to further clarify the cut-off values of NLR and PLR and their clinical applications.© 2023.

The NLR and middle ear risk index were calculated for 210 chronic otitis media (COM) patients retrospectively. NLR compared between COM patients and 159 participants in control group. Pearson correlation analysis was performed for NLR and MERI. In addition, The cut-off value, sensitivity, and specificity for NLR were determined in COM according to the severity of the disease with ROC analysis. The average of NLR in all patients was 1.94 ± 0.89. NLR was calculated as 2.05 ± 1.03 in the patients with COM and 1.79 ± 0.64 in the control group (p = 0.006, 95% CI 0.07-0.44, t test). According to the ROC analysis, the cut-off point was determined as 1.95 for moderate and severe disease in MERI. For the cut of a NLR = 1.95, sensitivity was calculated as 48.5% and the specificity 57.1% for moderate and severe COM. MERI score was found significantly higher in patients with postoperative graft perforation (p < 0.001, 95% CI 0.7-1.8). NLR has not related significantly with the MERI score according to linear regression analysis (p = 0.927). NLR was found to be significantly higher in chronic otitis media patients compared to the control group. But NLR was not related to the severity of the disease classified with MERI.

Ongoing inflammatory responses play an important role in this association. Systemic inflammation is important in pathophysiology of OSA and its comorbidity. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the role of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in OSA patients and comparing with other well-known inflammatory marker, C-reactive protein (CRP) along with thyroid-stimulating hormone(TSH) and body-mass index(BMI). We conducted a retrospective analysis of 162 patients with OSA and divided them into 2 categories based on apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) (< 30 and >  = 30), and recorded their leukocyte profiles, sex, age and body mass index. 80 matched healthy controls were taken. Patients were excluded if they had underlying cancer, chronic inflammatory disease, any systemic infection, uncontrolled hypertension and diabetes mellitus, a known acute coronary syndrome, valvular heart disease, renal or hepatic dysfunction. We found that N/L Ratio in severe OSA patients was significantly higher compared with mild and moderate OSA patients and healthy controls (p < 0.001). CRP levels were not different in all OSA stages (p = 0.595). We noted a significant difference in mean BMI of the two groups. In the wake of increase in prevalence of OSA in a developing country like India coupled with inadequate proportion of sleep labs, NLR is an inexpensive, easy to obtain, widely available marker of inflammation that might in combination with other markers assist in identifying patients with severe OSA.© Association of Otolaryngologists of India 2021."
"36694091","Proposal of a new diagnostic algorithm for adult-onset Still's disease.","Clin Rheumatol","This study was performed to develop a new diagnostic algorithm for adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD).We conducted a multicenter prospective nationwide case-control study in tertiary Internal Medicine, Rheumatology, and Infectious Diseases departments, to include successively patients with suspected AOSD based on the presence of two or more major criteria of Yamaguchi and/or Fautrel classifications. Patients were classified as AOSD or controls according to a predefined procedure. A receiving operating characteristic curve was used to determine the best cutoff value of the points-based score for disease classification. A diagnostic algorithm was developed to help the physician in the diagnostic approach.A total of 160 patients were included, 80 patients with AOSD and 60 controls with different diagnoses. Twenty patients with incomplete data were excluded. In the multivariate analysis, 6 items remained independently associated with AOSD diagnosis: typical rash (OR: 24.01, 3 points), fever ≥ 39 °C (OR: 17.34, 3 points), pharyngitis (OR: 10.23, 2 points), arthritis (OR: 9.01, 2 points), NLR ≥ 4 (OR: 11.10, 2 points), and glycosylated ferritin ≤ 20% (OR: 1.59, 1 point). AOSD should be considered if the patient satisfies 7 points with a sensitivity of 92.5%, specificity of 93.3%, and accuracy of 92.8% (area under the curve (AUC): 0.97 [95% CI: 0.94-0.99]). The present points-based score was more accurate and sensitive than the Yamaguchi classification (78.8%, 92.5%, p = 0.01) and Fautrel classification (76.3%, 92.5%, p = 0.004). A typical rash associated with a points-based score ≥ 7 points leads to a very likely disease.The proposed new algorithm could be a good diagnostic tool for adult-onset Still's disease in clinical practice and research. Key Points • A diagnostic algorithm was performed to help the physician in the diagnostic approach of AOSD. • The points-based score included in this algorithm had a high sensitivity and accuracy. • This diagnostic algorithm can be useful in the clinical research.© 2023.

In this study, we used an inducible DCM-RNA polymerase subunit b fusion protein which labels active genes and enhancers with a bacterial methylation mark that does not affect gene transcription and is propagated in S-phase. This DCM-RNA polymerase fusion protein enables transcribed genes and active enhancers to be tagged and then examined at later stages of development or differentiation. We apply this DCM-time machine (DCM-TM) technology to study intestinal homeostasis, revealing rapid and coordinated activation of enhancers and nearby genes during enterocyte differentiation. We provide new insights in absorptive-secretory lineage decision-making in intestinal stem cell (ISC) differentiation and show that ISCs retain a unique chromatin landscape required to maintain ISC identity and delineate future expression of differentiation-associated genes. DCM-TM has wide applicability in tracking cell states, providing new insights in the regulatory networks underlying cell state changes.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36778482","Coevolution of the CDCA7-HELLS ICF-related nucleosome remodeling complex and DNA methyltransferases.","bioRxiv","5-Methylcytosine (5mC) and DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) are broadly conserved in eukaryotes but are also frequently lost during evolution. The mammalian SNF2 family ATPase HELLS and its plant ortholog DDM1 are critical for the maintenance of 5mC. Mutations in HELLS, its activator subunit CDCA7, and the de novo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B, cause immunodeficiency-centromeric instability-facial anomalies (ICF) syndrome, a genetic disorder associated with the loss of DNA methylation. We here examine the coevolution of CDCA7, HELLS and DNMTs. While DNMT3, the maintenance DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1), HELLS, and CDCA7 are all highly conserved in vertebrates and green plants, they are frequently lost in other evolutionary clades. The presence-absence patterns of these genes are not random; almost all CDCA7 harboring eukaryote species also have HELLS and DNMT1 (or another maintenance methyltransferase, DNMT5), whereas species that maintain DNMT1 or HELLS without CDCA7 are identified in several clades, such as Fungi and Ecdysozoa. Coevolution of presence-absence patterns (CoPAP) analysis in Ecdysozoa further indicates coevolutionary linkages among CDCA7, HELLS, DNMT1 and its activator UHRF1. Our study suggests that a unique specialized role of CDCA7 in HELLS-dependent DNA methylation maintenance is broadly inherited from the last eukaryotic common ancestor."

The method is illustrated using a crossover study of seventeen participants examining the effect of exposure to ozone versus clean air on the DNA methylome, where the multivariate outcome involved 484,531 genomic locations. Our proposed test yields a single null randomization distribution, and thus a single Fisher-exactp-value that is statistically valid whatever the structure of the data.

"36713578","DNA methylation-based patterns for early diagnostic prediction and prognostic evaluation in colorectal cancer patients with high tumor mutation burden.","Front Oncol","Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy has proven to be a promising treatment for colorectal cancer (CRC). We aim to investigate the relationship between DNA methylation and tumor mutation burden (TMB) by integrating genomic and epigenetic profiles to precisely identify clinical benefit populations and to evaluate the effect of ICI therapy.A total of 536 CRC tissues from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) with mutation data were collected and subjected to calculate TMB. 80 CRC patients with high TMB and paired normal tissues were selected as training sets and developed the diagnostic and prognostic methylation models, respectively. In the validation set, the diagnostic model was validated in our in-house 47 CRC tissues and 122 CRC tissues from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets, respectively. And a total of 38 CRC tissues with high TMB from the COLONOMICS dataset verified the prognostic model.A positive correlation between differential methylation positions and TMB level was observed in TCGA CRC cohort (r=0.45). The diagnostic score that consisted of methylation levels of four genes (ADHFE1,DOK6,GPR75, andMAP3K14-AS1) showed high diagnostic performance in the discovery (AUC=1.000) and two independent validation (AUC=0.946, AUC=0.857) datasets. Additionally, these four genes showed significant positive correlations with NK cells. The prognostic score containing three genes (POU3F3,SYN2, andTMEM178A) had significantly poorer survival in the high-risk TMB samples than those in the low-risk TMB samples (P=0.016). CRC patients with low-risk scores combined with TMB levels represent a favorable survival.By integrating analyses of methylation and mutation data, it is suggested that DNA methylation patterns combined with TMB serve as a novel potential biomarker for early screening in more high-TMB populations and for evaluating the prognostic effect of CRC patients with ICI therapy.Copyright © 2023 Huang, Cao, Long, Kuang, Li, Feng, Wu, Zhao, Chen, Sun, Peng, Zhang, Yuan, Li, Hu, Li, Yang, Zhang, Hu, Sun and Hu."

There is also a growing appreciation that male and female foetuses develop differentlyin utero, with unique epigenetic changes in placental tissue. Here, we report meta-analysed sex-specific associations between gestational age and placental DNA methylation from four cohorts in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) Programme (355 females/419 males, gestational ages 23-42 weeks). We identified 407 cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpGs) in females and 794 in males where placental methylation levels were associated with gestational age. After cell-type adjustment, 55 CpGs in females and 826 in males were significant. These were enriched for biological processes critical to the immune system in females and transmembrane transport in males. Our findings are distinct between the sexes: in females, associations with gestational age are largely explained by differences in placental cellular composition, whereas in males, gestational age is directly associated with numerous alterations in methylation levels."
"36628941","Associations of green and blue space exposure in pregnancy with epigenetic gestational age acceleration.","Epigenetics","Early life is seen as a particularly sensitive period for environmental exposures. Natural space exposure during pregnancy has been associated with offspring health. Epigenetic gestational age acceleration, a discrepancy between clinical and DNA methylation-based gestational age, may underlie these associations. In 1359 mother-newborn pairs from the population-based Generation R Study, we examined the associations of natural space exposure, defined as surrounding greenness, distance to major green and blue (water) space, and size of the blue space during pregnancy with offspring epigenetic gestational age acceleration. Natural space exposure was based on participants' geocoded addresses, and epigenetic gestational age acceleration was calculated from cord blood DNA methylation using Bohlin's and Knight's epigenetic clocks. Sensitivity analyses were conducted in a subgroup of newborns with optimal pregnancy dating, based on last menstrual period. Surrounding greenness, measured in normalized difference vegetation index values, was intermediate (median 0.4, IQR 0.2), and 84% and 56% of the participants had a major green or blue space near their home address, respectively. We did not observe associations of natural space availability during pregnancy with offspring epigenetic gestational age acceleration. This could imply that epigenetic gestational age acceleration in cord blood does not underlie the effects of residential natural space availability in pregnancy on offspring health. Future studies could investigate whether residential natural space availability during pregnancy is associated with offspring differential DNA methylation at other CpGs than those included in the epigenetic gestational clocks."
"36864020","Epigenetic regulation in metabolic diseases: mechanisms and advances in clinical study.","Signal Transduct Target Ther","Epigenetics regulates gene expression and has been confirmed to play a critical role in a variety of metabolic diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), osteoporosis, gout, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism and others. The term 'epigenetics' was firstly proposed in 1942 and with the development of technologies, the exploration of epigenetics has made great progresses. There are four main epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modification, chromatin remodelling, and noncoding RNA (ncRNA), which exert different effects on metabolic diseases. Genetic and non-genetic factors, including ageing, diet, and exercise, interact with epigenetics and jointly affect the formation of a phenotype. Understanding epigenetics could be applied to diagnosing and treating metabolic diseases in the clinic, including epigenetic biomarkers, epigenetic drugs, and epigenetic editing. In this review, we introduce the brief history of epigenetics as well as the milestone events since the proposal of the term 'epigenetics'. Moreover, we summarise the research methods of epigenetics and introduce four main general mechanisms of epigenetic modulation. Furthermore, we summarise epigenetic mechanisms in metabolic diseases and introduce the interaction between epigenetics and genetic or non-genetic factors. Finally, we introduce the clinical trials and applications of epigenetics in metabolic diseases.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36837846","Metabolic Signatures Elucidate the Effect of Body Mass Index on Type 2 Diabetes.","Metabolites","Obesity plays an important role in the development of insulin resistance and diabetes, but the molecular mechanism that links obesity and diabetes is still not completely understood. Here, we used 146 targeted metabolomic profiles from the German KORA FF4 cohort consisting of 1715 participants and associated them with obesity and type 2 diabetes. In the basic model, 83 and 51 metabolites were significantly associated with body mass index (BMI) and T2D, respectively. Those metabolites are branched-chain amino acids, acylcarnitines, lysophospholipids, or phosphatidylcholines. In the full model, 42 and 3 metabolites were significantly associated with BMI and T2D, respectively, and replicate findings in the previous studies. Sobel mediation testing suggests that the effect of BMI on T2D might be mediated via lipids such as sphingomyelin (SM) C16:1, SM C18:1 and diacylphosphatidylcholine (PC aa) C38:3. Moreover, mendelian randomization suggests a causal relationship that BMI causes the change of SM C16:1 and PC aa C38:3, and the change of SM C16:1, SM C18:1, and PC aa C38:3 contribute to T2D incident. Biological pathway analysis in combination with genetics and mice experiments indicate that downregulation of sphingolipid or upregulation of phosphatidylcholine metabolism is a causal factor in early-stage T2D pathophysiology. Our findings indicate that metabolites like SM C16:1, SM C18:1, and PC aa C38:3 mediate the effect of BMI on T2D and elucidate their role in obesity related T2D pathologies."
"36838754","The Epigenetic Effects of Coffee.","Molecules","In this review, we discuss the recent knowledge regarding the epigenetic effects of coffee extract and the three essential active ingredients in coffee (caffeine, chlorogenic acid, and caffeic acid). As a popular beverage, coffee has many active ingredients which have a variety of biological functions such as insulin sensitization, improvement of sugar metabolism, antidiabetic properties, and liver protection. However, recent researches have shown that coffee is not only beneficial for human, but also bad, which may be due to its complex components. Studies suggest that coffee extract and its components can potentially impact gene expression via alteration of DNA methylation, histone modifications, and ncRNA expression; thus, exert long lasting impacts on the epigenome. More importantly, coffee consumption during pregnancy has been linked to multiple negative effects on offspring due to epigenetic modifications; on the other hand, it has also been linked to improvements in many diseases, including cancer. Therefore, understanding more about the epigenetic effects associated with coffee components is crucial to finding ways for improving human health."

We identified four genes significantly associated with the proxy phenotype, three of which were significantly associated with proxy Alzheimer's disease/dementia in an independent replication cohort consisting of 197,506 unrelated individuals of European ancestry in the UK biobank. All three of the replicated genes have been previously associated with clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease (SORL1, TREM2, and TOMM40/APOE).

However, earlier identification of AD has great potential to advance clinical care and determine candidates for drug trials. The extent to which AD risk markers relate to cortical thinning patterns in midlife is unknown. The first objective of this study was to examine cortical thickness change associated with genetic risk for AD among middle-aged military veterans. The second objective was to determine the relationship between plasma tau and Aβ and change in brain cortical thickness among veterans stratified by genetic risk for AD.Participants consisted of post-9/11 veterans (N = 155) who were consecutively enrolled in the Translational Research Center for TBI and Stress Disorders prospective longitudinal cohort and were assessed for mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) and posttraumatic disorder (PTSD). Genome-wide polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for AD were calculated using summary results from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Disease Project. T-tau and Aβ40 and Aβ42 plasma assays were run using Simoa technology. Whole-brain MRI cortical thickness change estimates were obtained using the longitudinal stream of FreeSurfer. Follow-up moderation analyses examined the AD PRS × plasma interaction on change in cortical thickness in AD-vulnerable regions.Higher AD PRS, signifying greater genetic risk for AD, was associated with accelerated cortical thickness change in a right hemisphere inferior parietal cortex cluster that included the supramarginal gyrus, angular gyrus, and intraparietal sulcus. Higher tau, but not Aβ42/40 ratio, was associated with greater cortical thickness change among those with higher AD PRS. Mild TBI and PTSD were not associated with cortical thickness change.Plasma tau, particularly when combined with genetic stratification for AD risk, can be a useful indicator of brain change in midlife. Accelerated inferior parietal cortex changes in midlife may be an important factor to consider as a marker of AD-related brain alterations.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

To further explore the molecular mechanisms of CCA hepatotoxicity, we analyzed 10%-buffered formalin-fixed liver samples from female rats for cell proliferation, apoptosis, and protein glutathionylation and conducted microarray analysis on frozen liver samples from female rats treated with 0 or 80 mg/kg/day of CCA. Chemical analysis revealed that dimethylated arsenical was the major metabolite in liver tissues of male and female rats. CCA increase labeling indices of proliferating cell nuclear antigen and decrease terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling accompanied with increased expression of protein glutathionylation, indicating a decrease in glutathione (GSH) in hepatocytes of female rats. Microarray analysis revealed that CCA altered gene expression of antioxidants, glutathione-S-transferase (GST), heat shock proteins and ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, cell proliferation, apoptosis, DNA methylation, cytochrome P450, and glucose and lipid metabolism in female rats. Increased expression of GSTs, includingGsta2,Gsta3,Mgst1, andCdkn1b(p27), and decreased expression of the antioxidantMt1, and DNA methylationDnmt1,Dnmt3a, andCtcfwere confirmed in the liver of female rats in a dose-dependent manner.

Race and sex genetic backgrounds have become a major focus of many diseases modeling and drug response evaluation in the pharmaceutical industry. Here, we gathered data from major stem cell repositories to analyze the diversity with respect to ethnicity, sex, and disease types; and we also analyzed public datasets to unravel transcriptomics differences between samples of different ethnicities and sexes. We found a lack of diversity despite the large sample size of human induced pluripotent stem cells. In the ethnic comparison, the White group made up the majority of the banked hiPSCs. Similarly, for the organ/disease type and sex comparisons, the neural and male hiPSCs accounted for the majority of currently available hiPSCs. Bulk RNA-seq and single-cell transcriptomic analysis coupled with Machine Learning and Network Analysis revealed panels of gene features differently expressed in healthy hiPSCs and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) of different races and sexes. The data highlights the current ethnic and sex inequality in stem cell research and demonstrates the molecular biological diversity of hiPSCs and cardiomyocytes from different races and genders. We postulate that future efforts in stem cell biology, regenerative and precision medicine should be guided towards an inclusive, diverse repository reflecting the prevalence of diseases across racial and ethnic groups and the sexes, important for both common and rare disease modeling, drug screening, and cell therapeutics.Copyright © 2023 Nguyen, Lac, Abdi, Banerjee, Deng and Zhang."

Information on maternal smoking status (yes or no) during pregnancy was collected from medical records and maternal questionnaires before discharge. Adolescents underwent volumetric brain MRI at 13 years of age. Image post-processing was performed with FreeSurfer. Regional volumes, cortical thickness, surface area, and curvature were computed from 33 cortical regions of interest (ROIs). Additionally, volumes were calculated for 18 subcortical regions, as well as for white matter, gray matter, and intracranial volume. We normalized quantified absolute volumes for head size by dividing volumes with corresponding intracranial volumes. false discovery rate (FDR) correction for multiple comparisons across regions was used.A total of 9/44 (21%) adolescents had been exposed to maternal smoking during pregnancy. No statistically significant differences in absolute volumes were observed between the groups (p> 0.05). Regarding volumes proportional to intracranial volume, the adolescents in the exposed group exhibited smaller gray matter volumes in the inferotemporal (FDR correctedp= 0.022) and parahippocampal (p= 0.018) regions compared to the unexposed group. The surface area in the exposed group was also smaller in the parahippocampal (p= 0.046) and postcentral (p= 0.046) regions compared to the unexposed group. No statistically significant differences after correction for multiple comparisons were found for either curvature or cortical thickness between the groups.Maternal smoking exposure during pregnancy may have long-term effects on brain volumes up to 13 years in adolescents born very preterm. Our findings emphasize the importance of smoking-free pregnancy.Copyright © 2023 Ekblad, Ngum, Merisaari, Saunavaara, Parkkola and Setänen."
"36635387","A single-cell massively parallel reporter assay detects cell-type-specific gene regulation.","Nat Genet","Massively parallel reporter gene assays are key tools in regulatory genomics but cannot be used to identify cell-type-specific regulatory elements without performing assays serially across different cell types. To address this problem, we developed a single-cell massively parallel reporter assay (scMPRA) to measure the activity of libraries of cis-regulatory sequences (CRSs) across multiple cell types simultaneously. We assayed a library of core promoters in a mixture of HEK293 and K562 cells and showed that scMPRA is a reproducible, highly parallel, single-cell reporter gene assay that detects cell-type-specific cis-regulatory activity. We then measured a library of promoter variants across multiple cell types in live mouse retinas and showed that subtle genetic variants can produce cell-type-specific effects on cis-regulatory activity. We anticipate that scMPRA will be widely applicable for studying the role of CRSs across diverse cell types.© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc."
"36776394","The role of pyroptosis in endothelial dysfunction induced by diseases.","Front Immunol","Most organs in the body rely on blood flow, and vesicular damage is the leading cause of injury in multiple organs. The endothelium, as the barriers of vessels, play a critical role in ensuring vascular homeostasis and angiogenesis. The rapid development of risk factors in endothelial injuries has been seen in the past decade, such as smoking, infectious, and diabetes mellites. Pyroptotic endothelium is an inflammatory mode of governed endothelial cell death that depend on the metabolic disorder and severe infectious such as atherosclerosis, and sepsis-related acute lung injury, respectively. Pyroptotic endothelial cells need GSDMD cleaved into N- and C-terminal by caspase1, and the cytokines are released by a pore constructed by the N-terminal of GSDMD in the membrane of ECs, finally resulting in severe inflammation and pyroptotic cell death. This review will focus on the patho-physiological and pharmacological pathways of pyroptotic endothelial metabolism in diseases. Overall, this review indicates that pyroptosis is a significant risk factor in diseases and a potential drug target in related diseases.Copyright © 2023 Ju, Liu, Liang and Yang."
"36803548","MYC promotes fibroblast osteogenesis by regulating ALP and BMP2 to participate in ectopic ossification of ankylosing spondylitis.","Arthritis Res Ther","Ectopic ossification is an important cause of disability in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Whether fibroblasts can transdifferentiate into osteoblasts and contribute to ossification remains unknown. This study aims to investigate the role of stem cell transcription factors (POU5F1, SOX2, KLF4, MYC, etc.) of fibroblasts in ectopic ossification in patients with AS.Primary fibroblasts were isolated from the ligaments of patients with AS or osteoarthritis (OA). In an in vitro study, primary fibroblasts were cultured in osteogenic differentiation medium (ODM) to induce ossification. The level of mineralization was assessed by mineralization assay. The mRNA and protein levels of stem cell transcription factors were measured by real-time quantitative PCR (q-PCR) and western blotting. MYC was knocked down by infecting primary fibroblasts with lentivirus. The interactions between stem cell transcription factors and osteogenic genes were analysed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Recombinant human cytokines were added to the osteogenic model in vitro to evaluate their role in ossification.We found that MYC was elevated significantly in the process of inducing primary fibroblasts to differentiate into osteoblasts. In addition, the level of MYC was remarkably higher in AS ligaments than in OA ligaments. When MYC was knocked down, the expression of the osteogenic genes alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP2) was decreased, and the level of mineralization was reduced significantly. In addition, the ALP and BMP2 were confirmed to be the direct target genes of MYC. Furthermore, interferon-γ (IFN-γ), which showed high expression in AS ligaments, was found to promote the expression of MYC in fibroblasts in the process of ossification in vitro.This study demonstrates the role of MYC in ectopic ossification. MYC may act as the critical bridge that links inflammation with ossification in AS, thus providing new insights into the molecular mechanisms of ectopic ossification in AS.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Specifically, missense variants in H3-3A and H3-3B, which both encode Histone 3.3, were discovered to cause a novel neurodevelopmental disorder, Bryant-Li-Bhoj syndrome. Most of the causative variants are private and scattered throughout the protein, but all seem to have either a gain-of-function or dominant negative effect on protein function.

"36799181","Modulating epigenetic modifications for cancer therapy (Review).","Oncol Rep","Cancer is a global public health concern. Alterations in epigenetic processes are among the earliest genomic aberrations occurring during cancer development and are closely related to progression. Unlike genetic mutations, aberrations in epigenetic processes are reversible, which opens the possibility for novel pharmacological treatments. Non‑coding RNAs (ncRNAs) represent an essential epigenetic mechanism, and emerging evidence links ncRNAs to carcinogenesis. Epigenetic drugs (epidrugs) are a group of promising target therapies for cancer treatment acting as coadjuvants to reverse drug resistance in cancer. The present review describes central epigenetic aberrations during malignant transformation and explains how epidrugs target DNA methylation, histone modifications and ncRNAs. Furthermore, clinical trials focused on evaluating the effect of these epidrugs alone or in combination with other anticancer therapies and other ncRNA‑based therapies are discussed. The use of epidrugs promises to be an effective tool for reversing drug resistance in some patients with cancer."
"36821650","Through the lens of phase separation: intrinsically unstructured protein and chromatin looping.","Nucleus","The establishment, maintenance and dynamic regulation of three-dimensional (3D) chromatin structures provide an important means for partitioning of genome into functionally distinctive domains, which helps to define specialized gene expression programs associated with developmental stages and cell types. Increasing evidence supports critical roles for intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) harbored within transcription factors (TFs) and chromatin-modulatory proteins in inducing phase separation, a phenomenon of forming membrane-less condensates through partitioning of biomolecules. Such a process is also critically involved in the establishment of high-order chromatin structures and looping. IDR- and phase separation-driven 3D genome (re)organization often goes wrong in disease such as cancer. This review discusses about recent advances in understanding how phase separation of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) modulates chromatin looping and gene expression."

Herein, we report a proof-of-concept result of sex-specific protein corona compositions on the surface of silica NPs as a function of their size and porosity upon incubation with plasma proteins of female and male BALB/c mice. Our results demonstrate substantial differences between male and female protein corona profiles on the surface of silica nanoparticles. By comparing protein abundances between male and female protein coronas of mesoporous silica nanoparticles and Stöber silica nanoparticles of ∼100, 50, and 100 nm in diameter, respectively, we detected 17, 4, and 4 distinct proteins, respectively, that were found at significantly different concentrations for these constructs. These initial findings demonstrate that animal sex can influence protein corona formation on silica NPs as a function of the physicochemical properties. A more thorough consideration of the role of plasma sex would enable nanomedicine community to design and develop safer and more efficient diagnostic and therapeutic nanomedicine products for both sexes.© 2022 The Authors.

"36802379","Escape from X-inactivation in twins exhibits intra- and inter-individual variability across tissues and is heritable.","PLoS Genet","X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) silences one X in female cells to balance sex-differences in X-dosage. A subset of X-linked genes escape XCI, but the extent to which this phenomenon occurs and how it varies across tissues and in a population is as yet unclear. To characterize incidence and variability of escape across individuals and tissues, we conducted a transcriptomic study of escape in adipose, skin, lymphoblastoid cell lines and immune cells in 248 healthy individuals exhibiting skewed XCI. We quantify XCI escape from a linear model of genes' allelic fold-change and XIST-based degree of XCI skewing. We identify 62 genes, including 19 lncRNAs, with previously unknown patterns of escape. We find a range of tissue-specificity, with 11% of genes escaping XCI constitutively across tissues and 23% demonstrating tissue-restricted escape, including cell type-specific escape across immune cells of the same individual. We also detect substantial inter-individual variability in escape. Monozygotic twins share more similar escape than dizygotic twins, indicating that genetic factors may underlie inter-individual differences in escape. However, discordant escape also occurs within monozygotic co-twins, suggesting environmental factors also influence escape. Altogether, these data indicate that XCI escape is an under-appreciated source of transcriptional differences, and an intricate phenotype impacting variable trait expressivity in females.Copyright: © 2023 Zito et al.

However, it is elusive why the known dosage compensation machinery showed uneven and small influence on X genes. Here, based on >20,000 transcriptomes, we identified two X gene groups (ploidy-sensitive [PSX] and ploidy-insensitive [PIX]), showing distinct but evolutionarily conserved dosage compensations (termed XAR). We demonstrated that XAR-PIX was downregulated whereas XAR-PSX upregulated at both RNA and protein levels across cancer types, in contrast with their trends during stem cell differentiation. XAR-PIX, but not XAR-PSX, was lower and correlated with autoantibodies and inflammation in patients of lupus, suggesting that insufficient dosage of PIX genes contribute to lupus pathogenesis. We further identified and experimentally validated two XAR regulators,TP53andATRX. Collectively, we provided insights into X dosage compensation in mammals and demonstrated different regulation of PSX and PIX and their pathophysiological roles in human diseases.© 2023 The Authors."
"36745657",NA,NA,"Immunotherapy has revolutionised cancer treatment. However, not all cancer patients benefit, and current stratification strategies based primarily on PD1 status and mutation burden are far from perfect. We hypothesised that high activation of an innate response relative to the adaptive response may prevent proper tumour neoantigen identification and decrease the specific anticancer response, both in the presence and absence of immunotherapy. To investigate this, we obtained transcriptomic data from three large publicly available cancer datasets, the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the Hartwig Medical Foundation (HMF), and a recently published cohort of metastatic bladder cancer patients treated with immunotherapy. To analyse immune infiltration into bulk tumours, we developed an RNAseq-based model based on previously published definitions to estimate the overall level of infiltrating innate and adaptive immune cells from bulk tumour RNAseq data. From these, the adaptive-to-innate immune ratio (A/I ratio) was defined. A meta-analysis of 32 cancer types from TCGA overall showed improved overall survival in patients with an A/I ratio above median (Hazard ratio (HR) females 0.73, HR males 0.86, P < 0.05). Of particular interest, we found that the association was different for males and females for eight cancer types, demonstrating a gender bias in the relative balance of the infiltration of innate and adaptive immune cells. For patients with metastatic disease, we found that responders to immunotherapy had a significantly higher A/I ratio than non-responders in HMF (P = 0.036) and a significantly higher ratio in complete responders in a separate metastatic bladder cancer dataset (P = 0.022). Overall, the adaptive-to-innate immune ratio seems to define separate states of immune activation, likely linked to fundamental immunological reactions to cancer. This ratio was associated with improved prognosis and improved response to immunotherapy, demonstrating potential relevance to patient stratification. Furthermore, by demonstrating a significant difference between males and females that associates with response, we highlight an important gender bias which likely has direct clinical relevance.Copyright: © 2023 Ahrenfeldt et al.

The incidence varies among race and sex as well as mortality and survival. The current study aimed to assess retinoblastoma cumulative incidence (CMI), mortality, and survival by sex.A retrospective cohort design was used to assess the CMI, mortality, and survival in this pediatric malignancy based on the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) data 2000-2017. The binomial regression model was used to examine sex differentials in mortality, as well as other study variables, while Cox proportional hazard model was used for the survival variability by sex.The CMI during this period was higher among males relative to females (males n = 249, 56.7%; females n = 190, 43.3%, χ2 = 2.90, df = 1, p = 0.089). There were sex differences in mortality, with excess mortality observed among males compared to females, risk ratio = 3.40, 95% CI [1.0-15.72]. The survival differences by sex indicated decreased survival among males relative to females, hazard ratio (HR) = 3.39, 95% CI [1.0-15.72]. After controlling for the potential confoundings, namely tumor grade, urbanity, and median income the survival disadvantage of males persisted. Compared to females', males were more than three times as likely to die, adjusted HR = 3.42, 99% CI [0.37-31.60].In a representative sample of pediatric retinoblastoma, there was a sex differential in survival with excess risk of dying identified among males relative to females, which may be explained in part by male X-linkage.© 2023 The Authors.

"36798175","Identification and analysis of individuals who deviate from their genetically-predicted phenotype.","bioRxiv","Findings from genome-wide association studies have facilitated the generation of genetic predictors for many common human phenotypes. Stratifying individuals misaligned to a genetic predictor based on common variants may be important for follow-up studies that aim to identify alternative causal factors. Using genome-wide imputed genetic data, we aimed to classify 158,951 unrelated individuals from the UK Biobank as either concordant or deviating from two well-measured phenotypes. We first applied our methods to standing height: our primary analysis classified 244 individuals (0.15%) as misaligned to their genetically predicted height. We show that these individuals are enriched for self-reporting being shorter or taller than average at age 10, diagnosed congenital malformations, and rare loss-of-function variants in genes previously catalogued as causal for growth disorders. Secondly, we apply our methods to LDL cholesterol. We classified 156 (0.12%) individuals as misaligned to their genetically predicted LDL cholesterol and show that these individuals were enriched for both clinically actionable cardiovascular risk factors and rare genetic variants in genes previously shown to be involved in metabolic processes. Individuals whose LDL-C was higher than expected based on the genetic predictor were also at higher risk of developing coronary artery disease and type-two diabetes, even after adjustment for measured LDL-C, BMI and age, suggesting upward deviation from genetically predicted LDL-C is indicative of generally poor health. Our results remained broadly consistent when performing sensitivity analysis based on a variety of parametric and non-parametric methods to define individuals deviating from polygenic expectation. Our analyses demonstrate the potential importance of quantitatively identifying individuals for further follow-up based on deviation from genetic predictions.Human genetics is becoming increasingly useful to help predict human traits across a population owing to findings from large-scale genetic association studies and advances in the power of genetic predictors. This provides an opportunity to potentially identify individuals that deviate from genetic predictions for a common phenotype under investigation. For example, an individual may be genetically predicted to be tall, but be shorter than expected. It is potentially important to identify individuals who deviate from genetic predictions as this can facilitate further follow-up to assess likely causes. Using 158,951 unrelated individuals from the UK Biobank, with height and LDL cholesterol, as exemplar traits, we demonstrate that approximately 0.15% & 0.12% of individuals deviate from their genetically predicted phenotypes respectively. We observed these individuals to be enriched for a range of rare clinical diagnoses, as well as rare genetic factors that may be causal. Our analyses also demonstrate several methods for detecting individuals who deviate from genetic predictions that can be applied to a range of continuous human phenotypes."

We examined the additional impact of psychosocial risk factors in probands-on top of or in combination with those in siblings-on depressive/anxious psychopathology in siblings.The sample included 636 participants (Mage = 49.7; 62.4% female) from 256 families, each including a proband with lifetime depressive and/or anxiety disorders and their sibling(s) (N = 380 proband-sibling pairs). Sixteen psychosocial risk factors were tested. In siblings, depressive and anxiety disorders were determined with standardized psychiatric interviews; symptom severity was measured using self-report questionnaires. Analyses were performed with mixed-effects models accounting for familial structure.In siblings, various psychosocial risk factors (female gender, low income, childhood trauma, poor parental bonding, being single, smoking, hazardous alcohol use) were associated with higher symptomatology and likelihood of disorder. The presence of the same risk factor in probands was independently associated (low income, being single) with higher symptomatology in siblings or moderated (low education, childhood trauma, hazardous alcohol use)-by reducing its strength-the association between the risk factor and symptomatology in siblings. There was no additional impact of risk factors in probands on likelihood of disorder in siblings.Our findings demonstrate the importance of weighing psychosocial risk factors within a family context, as it may provide relevant information on the risk of affective psychopathology for individuals.© 2023.

"36765607","Pre-Clinical Evaluation of the Hypomethylating Agent Decitabine for the Treatment of T-Cell Lymphoblastic Lymphoma.","Cancers (Basel)","T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) is a rare and aggressive lymphatic cancer, often diagnosed at a young age. Patients are treated with intensive chemotherapy, potentially followed by a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Although prognosis of T-LBL has improved with intensified treatment protocols, they are associated with side effects and 10-20% of patients still die from relapsed or refractory disease. Given this, the search toward less toxic anti-lymphoma therapies is ongoing. Here, we targeted the recently described DNA hypermethylated profile in T-LBL with the DNA hypomethylating agent decitabine. We evaluated the anti-lymphoma properties and downstream effects of decitabine, using patient derived xenograft (PDX) models. Decitabine treatment resulted in prolonged lymphoma-free survival in all T-LBL PDX models, which was associated with downregulation of the oncogenic MYC pathway. However, some PDX models showed more benefit of decitabine treatment compared to others. In more sensitive models, differentially methylated CpG regions resulted in more differentially expressed genes in open chromatin regions. This resulted in stronger downregulation of cell cycle genes and upregulation of immune response activating transcripts. Finally, we suggest a gene signature for high decitabine sensitivity in T-LBL. Altogether, we here delivered pre-clinical proof of the potential use of decitabine as a new therapeutic agent in T-LBL."
"36689467","Intra-tumor heterogeneity, turnover rate and karyotype space shape susceptibility to missegregation-induced extinction.","PLoS Comput Biol","The phenotypic efficacy of somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) stems from their incidence per base pair of the genome, which is orders of magnitudes greater than that of point mutations. One mitotic event stands out in its potential to significantly change a cell's SCNA burden-a chromosome missegregation. A stochastic model of chromosome mis-segregations has been previously developed to describe the evolution of SCNAs of a single chromosome type. Building upon this work, we derive a general deterministic framework for modeling missegregations of multiple chromosome types. The framework offers flexibility to model intra-tumor heterogeneity in the SCNAs of all chromosomes, as well as in missegregation- and turnover rates. The model can be used to test how selection acts upon coexisting karyotypes over hundreds of generations. We use the model to calculate missegregation-induced population extinction (MIE) curves, that separate viable from non-viable populations as a function of their turnover- and missegregation rates. Turnover- and missegregation rates estimated from scRNA-seq data are then compared to theoretical predictions. We find convergence of theoretical and empirical results in both the location of MIE curves and the necessary conditions for MIE. When a dependency of missegregation rate on karyotype is introduced, karyotypes associated with low missegregation rates act as a stabilizing refuge, rendering MIE impossible unless turnover rates are exceedingly high. Intra-tumor heterogeneity, including heterogeneity in missegregation rates, increases as tumors progress, rendering MIE unlikely.Copyright: © 2023 Kimmel et al.

"36855187","Investigating the effects of maltreatment and acute stress on the concordance of blood and DNA methylation methods of estimating immune cell proportions.","Clin Epigenetics","Immune cell proportions can be used to detect pathophysiological states and are also critical covariates in genomic analyses. The complete blood count (CBC) is the most common method of immune cell proportion estimation, but immune cell proportions can also be estimated using whole-genome DNA methylation (DNAm). Although the concordance of CBC and DNAm estimations has been validated in various adult and clinical populations, less is known about the concordance of existing estimators among stress-exposed individuals. As early life adversity and acute psychosocial stress have both been associated with unique DNAm alterations, the concordance of CBC and DNAm immune cell proportion needs to be validated in various states of stress.We report the correlation and concordance between CBC and DNAm estimates of immune cell proportions using the Illumina EPIC DNAm array within two unique studies: Study 1, a high-risk pediatric cohort of children oversampled for exposure to maltreatment (N = 365, age 8 to 14 years), and Study 2, a sample of young adults who have participated in an acute laboratory stressor with four pre- and post-stress measurements (N = 28, number of observations = 100). Comparing CBC and DNAm proportions across both studies, estimates of neutrophils (r = 0.948, p < 0.001), lymphocytes (r = 0.916, p < 0.001), and eosinophils (r = 0.933, p < 0.001) were highly correlated, while monocyte estimates were moderately correlated (r = 0.766, p < 0.001) and basophil estimates were weakly correlated (r = 0.189, p < 0.001). In Study 1, we observed significant deviations in raw values between the two approaches for some immune cell subtypes; however, the observed differences were not significantly predicted by exposure to child maltreatment. In Study 2, while significant changes in immune cell proportions were observed in response to acute psychosocial stress for both CBC and DNAm estimates, the observed changes were similar for both approaches.Although significant differences in immune cell proportion estimates between CBC and DNAm exist, as well as stress-induced changes in immune cell proportions, neither child maltreatment nor acute psychosocial stress alters the concordance of CBC and DNAm estimation methods. These results suggest that the agreement between CBC and DNAm estimators of immune cell proportions is robust to exposure to child maltreatment and acute psychosocial stress.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Childhood asthma is one of the commonest chronic medical illnesses in the USA which places a significant burden on the health-care system. We recently demonstrated a negative association between the duration of epidural anesthesia and the development of childhood asthma; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms still remain unclear. In this study of 127 mother-child pairs comprised of 75 Non-Hispanic Black (NHB) and 52 Non-Hispanic White (NHW) from the Newborn Epigenetic Study, we tested the hypothesis that umbilical cord blood DNA methylation mediates the association between the duration of exposure to epidural anesthesia at delivery and the development of childhood asthma and whether this differed by race/ethnicity. In the mother-child pairs of NHB ancestry, the duration of exposure to epidural anesthesia was associated with a marginally lower risk of asthma (odds ratio = 0.88, 95% confidence interval = 0.76-1.01) for each 1-h increase in exposure to epidural anesthesia. Of the 20 CpGs in the NHB population showing the strongest mediation effect, 50% demonstrated an average mediation proportion of 52%, with directional consistency of direct and indirect effects. These top 20 CpGs mapped to 21 genes enriched for pathways engaged in antigen processing, antigen presentation, protein ubiquitination and regulatory networks related to the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I complex and Nuclear Factor Kappa-B (NFkB) complex. Our findings suggest that DNA methylation in immune-related pathways contributes to the effects of the duration of exposure to epidural anesthesia on childhood asthma risk in NHB offspring.© The Author(s) 2023.

"36829529","Inter-Individual Variation in DNA Methylation Patterns across Two Tissues and Leukocytes in Mature Brahman Cattle.","Biology (Basel)","Quantifying the natural inter-individual variation in DNA methylation patterns is important for identifying its contribution to phenotypic variation, but also for understanding how the environment affects variability, and for incorporation into statistical analyses. The inter-individual variation in DNA methylation patterns in female cattle and the effect that a prenatal stressor has on such variability have yet to be quantified. Thus, the objective of this study was to utilize methylation data from mature Brahman females to quantify the inter-individual variation in DNA methylation. Pregnant Brahman cows were transported for 2 h durations at days 60 ± 5; 80 ± 5; 100 ± 5; 120 ± 5; and 140 ± 5 of gestation. A non-transport group was maintained as a control. Leukocytes, amygdala, and anterior pituitary glands were harvested from eight cows born from the non-transport group (Control) and six from the transport group (PNS) at 5 years of age. The DNA harvested from the anterior pituitary contained the greatest variability in DNA methylation of cytosine-phosphate-guanine (mCpG) sites from both the PNS and Control groups, and the amygdala had the least. Numerous variable mCpG sites were associated with retrotransposable elements and highly repetitive regions of the genome. Some of the genomic features that had high variation in DNA methylation are involved in immune responses, signaling, responses to stimuli, and metabolic processes. The small overlap of highly variable CpG sites and features between tissues and leukocytes supports the role of variable DNA methylation in regulating tissue-specific gene expression. Many of the CpG sites that exhibited high variability in DNA methylation were common between the PNS and Control groups within a tissue, but there was little overlap in genomic features with high variability. The interaction between the prenatal environment and the genome could be responsible for the differences in location of the variable DNA methylation."

Adults with type 2 diabetes, HbA1c>58mmol/mol (>7.5%), received 16 weeks of either pioglitazone (30mg) or vildagliptin (50mg) daily, then switched to the other medication over for another 16 weeks of treatment. Differences in HbA1c were tested for interaction with ethnicity or OHTG, controlling for baseline HbA1c using linear mixed models. Secondary outcomes included weight, blood pressure, side-effects and diabetes treatment satisfaction.346 participants were randomised (55% Māori/Pacific) between February 2019 to March 2020. HbA1c after pioglitazone was lower than after vildagliptin (mean difference -4.9mmol/mol [0.5%]; 95% CI -6.3, -3.5; p<0.0001). Primary intention-to-treat analysis showed no significant interaction effect by Māori/Pacific vs other ethnicity (1.5mmol/mol [0.1%], 95% CI -0.8, 3.7), and per-protocol analysis (-1.2mmol/mol [0.1%], 95% CI -4.1, 1.7). An interaction effect (-4.7mmol/mol [0.5%], 95% CI -8.1, -1.4) was found by OHTG status. Both treatments generated similar treatment satisfaction scores, although there was greater weight gain and greater improvement in lipids and liver enzymes after pioglitazone than vildagliptin.Comparative glucose-lowering by pioglitazone and vildagliptin is not different between Māori/Pacific people compared with other New Zealand ethnic groups.

To this end, we performed a discovery transcriptome-wide association study to identify differentially expressed genes associated with circulating IgE levels in whole-blood derived RNA from 5,345 participants in the Framingham Heart Study across 17,873 mRNA gene-level transcripts. We identified 216 significant transcripts at a false discovery rate <0.05. We conducted replication using the meta-analysis of two independent external studies: the Childhood Asthma Management Program (n=610) and the Genetic Epidemiology of Asthma in Costa Rica Study (n=326); we then reversed the discovery and replication cohorts, which revealed 59 significant genes that replicated in both directions. Gene ontology analysis revealed that many of these genes were implicated in immune function pathways, including defense response, inflammatory response, and cytokine production. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis revealed four genes (CLC,CCDC21,S100A13, andGCNT1) as putatively causal (p<0.05) regulators of IgE levels.GCNT1(beta=1.5,p=0.01)-which is a top result in the MR analysis of expression in relation to asthma and allergic diseases-plays a role in regulating T helper type 1 cell homing, lymphocyte trafficking, and B cell differentiation. Our findings build upon prior knowledge of IgE regulation and provide a deeper understanding of underlying molecular mechanisms. The IgE-associated genes that we identified-particularly those implicated in MR analysis-can be explored as promising therapeutic targets for asthma and IgE-related diseases.Copyright © 2023 Recto, Huan, Lee, Lee, Gereige, Yao, Hwang, Joehanes, Kelly, Lasky-Su, O’Connor and Levy."
"36641761","A two-gene random forest model to diagnose osteoarthritis based on RNA-binding protein-related genes in knee cartilage tissue.","Aging (Albany NY)","Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common diseases in the orthopedic clinic, characterized by progressive cartilage degradation. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are capable of binding to RNAs at transcription and translation levels, playing an important role in the pathogenesis of OA. This study aims to investigate the diagnosis values of RBP-related genes in OA. The RBPs were collected from previous studies, and the GSE114007 dataset (control = 18, OA = 20) was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) as the training cohort. Through various bioinformatical and machine learning methods, including genomic difference detection, protein-protein interaction network analyses, Lasso regression, univariate logistic regression, Boruta algorithm, and SVM-RFE, RNMT and RBM24 were identified and then included into the random forest (RF) diagnosis model. GSE117999 dataset (control = 10, OA = 10) and clinical samples collected from local hospital (control = 10, OA = 11) were used for external validation. The RF model was a promising tool to diagnose OA in the training dataset (area under curve [AUC] = 1.000, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.000-1.000), the GSE117999 cohort (AUC = 0.900, 95% CI = 0.769-1.000), and local samples (AUC = 0.759, 95% CI = 0.568-0.951). Besides, qPCR and Western Blotting experiments showed that RNMT (P< 0.05) and RBM24 (P< 0.01) were both down-regulated in CHON-001 cells with IL-1β treatment. In all, an RF model to diagnose OA based on RNMT and RBM24 in cartilage tissue was constructed, providing a promising clinical tool and possible cut-in points in molecular mechanism clarification."

We performed whole-genome sequencing of 71 oligodendrocytes and 51 neurons from neurotypical individuals (0.4 to 104 years old) and identified >67,000 somatic single nucleotide variants (sSNVs) and small insertions and deletions (indels). While both cell types accumulate mutations with age, oligodendrocytes accumulate sSNVs 69% faster than neurons (27/year versus 16/year) whereas indels accumulate 42% slower (1.8/year versus 3.1/year). Correlation with single-cell RNA and chromatin accessibility from the same brains revealed that oligodendrocyte mutations are enriched in inactive genomic regions and are distributed similarly to mutations in brain cancers. In contrast, neuronal mutations are enriched in open, transcriptionally active chromatin. These patterns highlight differences in the mutagenic processes in glia and neurons and suggest cell type-specific, age-related contributions to neurodegeneration and oncogenesis."
"36702998","APOBEC mutagenesis is a common process in normal human small intestine.","Nat Genet","APOBEC mutational signatures SBS2 and SBS13 are common in many human cancer types. However, there is an incomplete understanding of its stimulus, when it occurs in the progression from normal to cancer cell and the APOBEC enzymes responsible. Here we whole-genome sequenced 342 microdissected normal epithelial crypts from the small intestines of 39 individuals and found that SBS2/SBS13 mutations were present in 17% of crypts, more frequent than most other normal tissues. Crypts with SBS2/SBS13 often had immediate crypt neighbors without SBS2/SBS13, suggesting that the underlying cause of SBS2/SBS13 is cell-intrinsic. APOBEC mutagenesis occurred in an episodic manner throughout the human lifespan, including in young children. APOBEC1 mRNA levels were very high in the small intestine epithelium, but low in the large intestine epithelium and other tissues. The results suggest that the high levels of SBS2/SBS13 in the small intestine are collateral damage from APOBEC1 fulfilling its physiological function of editing APOB mRNA.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Here, we analyze single base substitutions and small insertions and deletions in pediatric cancers encompassing 785 whole-genome sequenced tumors from 27 molecularly defined cancer subtypes. We identified only a small number of mutational signatures active in pediatric cancers, compared with previously analyzed adult cancers. Further, we report a significant difference in the proportion of pediatric tumors showing homologous recombination repair defect signatures compared with previous analyses. In pediatric leukemias, we identified an indel signature, not previously reported, characterized by long insertions in nonrepeat regions, affecting mainly intronic and intergenic regions, but also exons of known cancer genes. We provide a systematic overview of COSMIC v.3 mutational signatures active across pediatric cancers, which is highly relevant for understanding tumor biology and enabling future research in defining biomarkers of treatment response.© 2023.

"36685831","Unravelling the instability of mutational signatures extraction via archetypal analysis.","Front Genet","The high cosine similarity between some single-base substitution mutational signatures and their characteristic flat profiles could suggest the presence of overfitting and mathematical artefacts. The newest version (v3.3) of the signature database available in the Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations InCancer(COSMIC) provides a collection of 79 mutational signatures, which has more than doubled with respect to previous version (30 profiles available in COSMIC signatures v2), making more critical the associations between signatures and specific mutagenic processes. This study both provides a systematic assessment of thede novoextraction task through simulation scenarios based on the latest version of the COSMIC signatures and highlights, through a novel approach using archetypal analysis, which COSMIC signatures are redundant and more likely to be considered as mathematical artefacts. 29 archetypes were able to reconstruct the profile of all the COSMIC signatures with cosine similarity>0.8. Interestingly, these archetypes tend to group similar original signatures sharing either the same aetiology or similar biological processes. We believe that these findings will be useful to encourage the development of newde novoextraction methods avoiding the redundancy of information among the signatures while preserving the biological interpretation.Copyright © 2023 Pancotti, Rollo, Birolo, Benevenuta, Fariselli and Sanavia."

Exploring the impact of money on men's self-reported markers of masculinity.","Front Psychol","Bodily markers, often self-reported, are frequently used in research to predict a variety of outcomes. The present study examined whether men, at the aggregate level, would overestimate certain bodily markers linked to masculinity, and if so, to what extent. Furthermore, the study explored whether the amount of monetary rewards distributed to male participants would influence the obtained data quality. Men from two participant pools were asked to self-report a series of bodily measures. All self-report measures except weight were consistently found to be above the population mean (height and penis size) or the scale midpoint (athleticism). Additionally, the participant pool that received the lower (vs. higher) monetary reward showed a particularly powerful deviation from the population mean in penis size and were significantly more likely to report their erect and flaccid penis size to be larger than the claimed but not verified world record of 34 cm. These findings indicate that studies relying on men's self-reported measures of certain body parts should be interpreted with great caution, but that higher monetary rewards seem to improve data quality slightly for such measures.Copyright © 2023 Christensen, Otterbring and Lagerkvist."

However, very few studies have investigated their associations with CVD in European populations.A total of 403,335 participants from the UK Biobank with data for TyG index and TG/HDL-C ratio and free from CVD at baseline were included. Cox models were applied to evaluate the association between TyG index and TG/HDL-C ratio and incident CVD. Mediation analyses were performed to evaluate the contribution of prevalent diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia to observed associations.During a median follow-up of 8.1 years, 19,754 (4.9%) individuals developed CVD, including 16,404 (4.1%) cases of CHD and 3976 (1.0%) cases of stroke. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios of total CVD in higher quartiles versus the lowest quartiles were 1.05, 1.05, and 1.19, respectively, for TyG index, and 1.07, 1.13, and 1.29, respectively, for TG/HDL-C ratio. There were significant trends toward an increasing risk of CVD across the quartiles of TyG index and TG/HDL-C ratio. In mediation analyses, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension explained 45.8%, 27.0%, and 15.0% of TyG index's association with CVD, respectively, and 40.0%, 11.8%, and 13.3% of TG/HDL-C ratio's association with CVD, respectively.Elevated baseline TyG index and TG/HDL-C ratio were associated with a higher risk of CVD after adjustment for the well-established CVD risk factors. These associations were largely mediated by greater prevalence of dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36740601","Association between cannabis use and blood pressure levels according to comorbidities and socioeconomic status.","Sci Rep","The associations between blood pressure and cannabis use remain inconsistent. The purpose of our study was to examine gender stratified associations of cannabis use and blood pressure [systolic, diastolic blood pressure (BP), pulse pressure (PP)] levels among the general UK Biobank population based study. Among 91,161 volunteers of the UK Biobank population, cannabis use status was assessed by questionnaire and range as heavy, moderate, low and never users. Associations between cannabis use and BP were estimated using multiple gender linear regressions. In adjusted covariates models, lifetime heavy cannabis use was associated with decrease in both SBP, DBP and PP in both genders, but with a higher effect among women (for SBP in men, b = - 1.09 (0.27), p < 0.001; in women, b = - 1.85 (0.36), p < 0.001; for DBP in men, b = - 0.50 (0.15), p < 0.001; in women, b = - 0.87 (0.17), p < 0.001; and for PP in men, b = - 0.60 (0.20), p < 0.001; in women, b = - 0.97 (0.27), p < 0.001. Among men, lower SBP and DBP levels were observed with participants without dyslipidemia and lower PP in participants with high income levels. Among women, lower SBP, DBP and PP were observed with current smokers, moderate/low alcohol levels and participants without dyslipidemia. Current cannabis use was associated with lower SBP levels in men (b = - 0.63 (0.25), p = 0.012) and in women (b = - 1.17 (0.31), p < 0.001). Same results were observed for DBP and PP. Negative association between BP in men was found but not in women. The small association in BP differences between heavy users and never users remains too small to adopt cannabis-blood pressure public policy in clinical practice.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36733281","Sexual behaviors, cannabis, alcohol and monkeypox infection.","Front Public Health","The emergence of the monkeypox virus (MPXV) outbreak in 2022 is a worldwide health issue. The rapid increase of monkeypox cases caused the WHO to designate the escalating global monkeypox outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on July 23, 2022. The WHO has called on the group currently most affected by the virus, men who have sex with men (MSM), to limit their sexual partners. The diminution in number of sexual partners not only decreases the proportion of infected MSM but could also increases the number of days needed to reach a given infection level among the general population. Several behavioral factors could be associated with high levels of different sexual partners, such as cannabis use and alcohol consumption. Firstly, this review focuses on the association between cannabis and alcohol consumption and the number of sexual partners, and their possible impact on the current MPXV outbreak by impairing the immune responses. Secondly, this review investigated in the UK Biobank cohort the relationship between alcohol and cannabis use and the number of sexual partners. Among the 115,604 participants, 1.8% declared to be MSM, 1.9% to be WSW (women having sex with women), 43.3% men heterosexuals and 53.0% women heterosexuals. MSM and WSW showed higher lifetime sexual partners (N= 17.4 (SD:17.52) andN= 13.65 (SD: 13.21), respectively) compared to heterosexual men (N= 6.89 (SD: 9.47) and women (N= 5.19 (SD:6.56),p< 0.001. After adjustment for age, body mass index, lifetime sexual activity, educational and income levels, tobacco and cardiovascular diseases, cannabis use and alcohol consumption remained significantly associated with increase in the number of different sexual partners in all four subgroups. Thus, cannabis use and alcohol consumption may have two detrimental effects on the MPXV outbreak: by participating in the increase of the number of sexual partners which are mainly responsible for the augmentation of the number of new MPXV infected cases and by impairing the immune response to a viral infection. Health and safety policies should address the factors and practices, including chemsex, leading to an increase in risk of sexual behaviors responsible for MPXV dissemination in the worldwide population.Copyright © 2023 Vallée."
"36711635","Leveraging family data to design Mendelian Randomization that is provably robust to population stratification.","bioRxiv","Mendelian Randomization (MR) has emerged as a powerful approach to leverage genetic instruments to infer causality between pairs of traits in observational studies. However, the results of such studies are susceptible to biases due to weak instruments as well as the confounding effects of population stratification and horizontal pleiotropy. Here, we show that family data can be leveraged to design MR tests that are provably robust to confounding from population stratification, assortative mating, and dynastic effects. We demonstrate in simulations that our approach, MR-Twin, is robust to confounding from population stratification and is not affected by weak instrument bias, while standard MR methods yield inflated false positive rates. We applied MR-Twin to 121 trait pairs in the UK Biobank dataset and found that MR-Twin identifies likely causal trait pairs and does not identify trait pairs that are unlikely to be causal. Our results suggest that confounding from population stratification can lead to false positives for existing MR methods, while MR-Twin is immune to this type of confounding."

The revealed epigenetic abnormalities implicate gene transcription and post-transcriptional regulation. In the light of these discoveries, the Mini Review focuses on the genesPACS1, MCHR1, DCLK3, HAPLN4, LMAN2L, TMEM258, GNL3, LRRC57, CACNA1C, CACNA1D, andNOVA2and their potential biological role in the pathogenesis of bipolar disorder. Molecular mechanisms under control of these genes do not translate into a unified picture and substantially more research is needed to fill the gaps in knowledge and to solve current limitations in prognosis and treatment of bipolar disorder.

However, the shared genetic factors of the five cancers were often revealed either by the combination of individual genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach or by the fixed-effect model-based meta-analysis approach with practically impossible assumptions. Here, we presented a random-effect model-based cross-cancer meta-analysis framework for identifying the genetic variants jointly influencing the five solid cancers. A comprehensive genetic correlation analysis (genome-wide, partitioned, and local) approach was performed by using GWAS summary statistics of the five cancers, and we observed three cancer pairs with significant genetic correlation: breast-ovarian cancer (rg= 0.221,p= 0.0003), breast-lung cancer (rg= 0.234,p= 7.6 × 10-6), and lung-head/neck cancer (rg= 0.652,p= 0.010). Furthermore, a random-effect model-based cross-trait meta-analysis was conducted for each significant cancer pair, and we found 27 shared genetic loci between breast and ovarian cancers, 18 loci between breast and lung cancers, and three loci between lung and head/neck cancers. Functional analysis indicates that the shared genes are enriched inhuman T-cell leukemia virus 1 infection (HTLV-1)andantigen processing and presentation (APP)pathways.

We hypothesized multivariate adaptive shrinkage may improve cross-population transcriptome prediction, as it leverages effect size estimates across different conditions - in this case, different populations. To test this hypothesis, we made transcriptome prediction models for use in transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) using different methods (Elastic Net, Matrix eQTL and Multivariate Adaptive Shrinkage in R (MASHR)) and tested their out-of-sample transcriptome prediction accuracy in population-matched and cross-population scenarios. Additionally, to evaluate model applicability in TWAS, we integrated publicly available multi-ethnic genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics from the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology Study (PAGE) and Pan-UK Biobank with our developed transcriptome prediction models. In regard to transcriptome prediction accuracy, MASHR models had similar performance to other methods when the training population ancestry closely matched the test population, but outperformed other methods in cross-population predictions. Furthermore, in multi-ethnic TWAS, MASHR models yielded more discoveries that replicate in both PAGE and PanUKBB across all methods analyzed, including loci previously mapped in GWAS and new loci previously not found in GWAS. Overall, our study demonstrates the importance of using methods that benefit from different populationsâ€™ effect size estimates in order to improve TWAS for multi-ethnic or underrepresented populations."

"36768850","From Classical to Modern Computational Approaches to Identify Key Genetic Regulatory Components in Plant Biology.","Int J Mol Sci","The selection of plant genotypes with improved productivity and tolerance to environmental constraints has always been a major concern in plant breeding. Classical approaches based on the generation of variability and selection of better phenotypes from large variant collections have improved their efficacy and processivity due to the implementation of molecular biology techniques, particularly genomics, Next Generation Sequencing and other omics such as proteomics and metabolomics. In this regard, the identification of interesting variants before they develop the phenotype trait of interest with molecular markers has advanced the breeding process of new varieties. Moreover, the correlation of phenotype or biochemical traits with gene expression or protein abundance has boosted the identification of potential new regulators of the traits of interest, using a relatively low number of variants. These important breakthrough technologies, built on top of classical approaches, will be improved in the future by including the spatial variable, allowing the identification of gene(s) involved in key processes at the tissue and cell levels."

The exact nature of the disorder remains a matter of ongoing research and debate. Here, we investigated the genetic etiology of misophonia to understand contributing genetic factors and shed light on individual differences in characteristics that are related to the disorder.For misophonia, we used an unpublished genome-wide association study (GWAS) from genetic service provider 23andMe, Inc., on a self-report item probing a single common misophonic symptom: the occurrence of rage when others produce eating sounds. First, we used gene-based and functional annotation analyses to explore neurobiological determinants of the rage-related misophonia symptom. Next, we calculated genetic correlations (rG) of this rage-related misophonia symptom GWAS with a wide range of traits and disorders from audiology (tinnitus, hearing performance, and hearing trauma), psychiatry, neurology, and personality traits.The rage-related misophonia symptom was significantly correlated with tinnitus, major depression disorder (MDD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; 0.12 <rG< 0.22). Stronger genetic correlations (0.21 <rG< 0.42) were observed for two clusters of personality traits: a guilt/neuroticism and an irritability/sensitivity cluster. Our results showed no genetic correlation with attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and psychotic disorders. A negative correlation with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was found, which may be surprising given the previously reported comorbidities and the sensory sensitivity reported in ASD. Clustering algorithms showed that rage-related misophonia consistently clustered with MDD, generalized anxiety, PTSD, and related personality traits.We conclude that-based on the genetics of a common misophonia symptom-misophonia most strongly clusters with psychiatric disorders and a personality profile consistent with anxiety and PTSD.Copyright © 2023 Smit, Bakker, Abdellaoui, Hoetink, Vulink and Denys."

Here we used a genetically diverse mouse population and applied systems genetics strategies to identify interactions between host and microbe phenotypes including microbial functions, using faecal metagenomics, small intestinal transcripts and caecal lipids that influence microbe-host dynamics. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping identified murine genomic regions associated with variations in bacterial taxa; bacterial functions including motility, sporulation and lipopolysaccharide production and levels of bacterial- and host-derived lipids. We found overlapping QTL for the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila and caecal levels of ornithine lipids. Follow-up in vitro and in vivo studies revealed that A. muciniphila is a major source of these lipids in the gut, provided evidence that ornithine lipids have immunomodulatory effects and identified intestinal transcripts co-regulated with these traits including Atf3, which encodes for a transcription factor that plays vital roles in modulating metabolism and immunity. Collectively, these results suggest that ornithine lipids are potentially important for A. muciniphila-host interactions and support the role of host genetics as a determinant of responses to gut microbes.© 2023.

We conducted a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) using expression interpolation from a large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) dataset to identify genes, biological pathways, and environmental chemicals associated with JIA.We obtained published GWAS data on JIA for TWAS and used mRNA expression profiling to validate the genes identified by TWAS. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was generated, and central genes were obtained using Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE). Finally, chemical gene expression datasets were obtained from the Comparative Toxicogenomics database for chemical genome enrichment analysis.TWAS identified 1481 genes associated with JIA, and 154 differentially expressed genes were identified based on mRNA expression profiles. After comparing the results of TWAS and mRNA expression profiles, we obtained eight overlapping genes. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses of the genes identified by TWAS yielded 163 pathways, and PPI network analysis as well as MCODE resolution identified a total of eight clusters. Through chemical gene set enrichment analysis, 287 environmental chemicals associated with JIA were identified.By integrating TWAS and mRNA expression profiles, genes, biological pathways, and environmental chemicals associated with JIA were identified.

Using several approaches, gene associations were integrated with the DrugTargetor drug-gene interaction database to identify drugs that could be repurposed for the treatment of ALS. Furthermore, ALS gene associations from TWAS were combined with observed blood expression in two external ALS case-control datasets to calculate polytranscriptomic scores and evaluate their utility for prediction of ALS risk and clinical characteristics, including site of onset, age at onset, and survival.SNP-based fine-mapping, TWAS and PWAS identified 117 genes associated with ALS, with TWAS and PWAS providing novel mechanistic insights. Drug repurposing analyses identified five drugs significantly enriched for interactions with ALS associated genes, with directional analyses highlighting α-glucosidase inhibitors may exacerbate ALS pathology. Additionally, drug class enrichment analysis showed calcium channel blockers may reduce ALS risk. Across the two observed expression target samples, ALS polytranscriptomic scores significantly predicted ALS risk (R2= 4%;p-value = 2.1×10-21).Functionally-informed analyses of ALS GWAS summary statistics identified novel mechanistic insights into ALS aetiology, highlighted several therapeutic research avenues, and enabled statistically significant prediction of ALS risk."
"36713247","Evolutionary mismatch and the role of GxE interactions in human disease.","ArXiv","Globally, we are witnessing the rise of complex, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) related to changes in our daily environments. Obesity, asthma, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes are part of a long list of ""lifestyle"" diseases that were rare throughout human history but are now common. A key idea from anthropology and evolutionary biology--the evolutionary mismatch hypothesis--seeks to explain this phenomenon. It posits that humans evolved in environments that radically differ from the ones experienced by most people today, and thus traits that were advantageous in past environments may now be ""mismatched"" and disease-causing. This hypothesis is, at its core, a genetic one: it predicts that loci with a history of selection will exhibit ""genotype by environment"" (GxE) interactions and have differential health effects in ancestral versus modern environments. Here, we discuss how this concept could be leveraged to uncover the genetic architecture of NCDs in a principled way. Specifically, we advocate for partnering with small-scale, subsistence-level groups that are currently transitioning from environments that are arguably more ""matched"" with their recent evolutionary history to those that are more ""mismatched"". These populations provide diverse genetic backgrounds as well as the needed levels and types of environmental variation necessary for mapping GxE interactions in an explicit mismatch framework. Such work would make important contributions to our understanding of environmental and genetic risk factors for NCDs across diverse ancestries and sociocultural contexts."
"36712136","The genetic architecture of the human skeletal form.","bioRxiv","The human skeletal form underlies our ability to walk on two legs, but unlike standing height, the genetic basis of limb lengths and skeletal proportions is less well understood. Here we applied a deep learning model to 31,221 whole body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) images from the UK Biobank (UKB) to extract 23 different image-derived phenotypes (IDPs) that include all long bone lengths as well as hip and shoulder width, which we analyzed while controlling for height. All skeletal proportions are highly heritable (âˆ¼40-50%), and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of these traits identified 179 independent loci, of which 102 loci were not associated with height. These loci are enriched in genes regulating skeletal development as well as associated with rare human skeletal diseases and abnormal mouse skeletal phenotypes. Genetic correlation and genomic structural equation modeling indicated that limb proportions exhibited strong genetic sharing but were genetically independent of width and torso proportions. Phenotypic and polygenic risk score analyses identified specific associations between osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip and knee, the leading causes of adult disability in the United States, and skeletal proportions of the corresponding regions. We also found genomic evidence of evolutionary change in arm-to-leg and hip-width proportions in humans consistent with striking anatomical changes in these skeletal proportions in the hominin fossil record. In contrast to cardiovascular, auto-immune, metabolic, and other categories of traits, loci associated with these skeletal proportions are significantly enriched in human accelerated regions (HARs), and regulatory elements of genes differentially expressed through development between humans and the great apes. Taken together, our work validates the use of deep learning models on DXA images to identify novel and specific genetic variants affecting the human skeletal form and ties a major evolutionary facet of human anatomical change to pathogenesis."
"36702996","Multi-ancestry transcriptome-wide association analyses yield insights into tobacco use biology and drug repurposing.","Nat Genet","Most transcriptome-wide association studies (TWASs) so far focus on European ancestry and lack diversity. To overcome this limitation, we aggregated genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics, whole-genome sequences and expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) data from diverse ancestries. We developed a new approach, TESLA (multi-ancestry integrative study using an optimal linear combination of association statistics), to integrate an eQTL dataset with a multi-ancestry GWAS. By exploiting shared phenotypic effects between ancestries and accommodating potential effect heterogeneities, TESLA improves power over other TWAS methods. When applied to tobacco use phenotypes, TESLA identified 273 new genes, up to 55% more compared with alternative TWAS methods. These hits and subsequent fine mapping using TESLA point to target genes with biological relevance. In silico drug-repurposing analyses highlight several drugs with known efficacy, including dextromethorphan and galantamine, and new drugs such as muscle relaxants that may be repurposed for treating nicotine addiction.© 2023.

Conventional transcriptome-wide association study approaches predict genetically regulated gene expression at the tissue level, without considering cell-type heterogeneity, and test associations of predicted tissue-level expression with disease. Here we develop MiXcan, a cell-type-aware transcriptome-wide association study approach that predicts cell-type-level expression, identifies disease-associated genes via combination of cell-type-level association signals for multiple cell types, and provides insight into the disease-critical cell type. As a proof of concept, we conducted cell-type-aware analyses of breast cancer in 58,648 women and identified 12 transcriptome-wide significant genes using MiXcan compared with only eight genes using conventional approaches. Importantly, MiXcan identified genes with distinct associations in mammary epithelial versus stromal cells, including three new breast cancer susceptibility genes. These findings demonstrate that cell-type-aware transcriptome-wide analyses can reveal new insights into the genetic and cellular etiology of breast cancer and other diseases.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Identifying the candidate genes for the productive ability of Huaxi cattle was one crucial element for practical breeding. Based on the genotype and phenotype data of 1,478 individuals and the RNA-seq data of 120 individuals contained in 1,478 individuals, we implemented genome-wide association studies (GWAS), transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), and Fisher's combined test (FCT) to identify the candidate genes for the carcass trait, the weight of longissimus dorsi muscle (LDM). The results indicated that GWAS, TWAS, and FCT identified seven candidate genes for LDM altogether:PENKwas located by GWAS and FCT,PPATwas located by TWAS and FCT, andXKR4,MTMR3,FGFRL1,DHRS4, andLAP3were only located by one of the methods. After functional analysis of these candidate genes and referring to the reported studies, we found that they were mainly functional in the progress of the development of the body and the growth of muscle cells.

DCS imposes very large social and economic burdens. However, its genetic basis remains elusive.Predicted whole-blood and skeletal muscle gene expression and genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from a DCS database were integrated, and functional summary-based imputation (FUSION) software was used on the integrated data. A transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) was conducted using FUSION software to assess the association between predicted gene expression and DCS risk. The TWAS-identified genes were verified via comparison with differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in DCS RNA expression profiles in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (Accession Number: GSE153761). The Functional Mapping and Annotation (FUMA) tool for genome-wide association studies and Meta tools were used for gene functional enrichment and annotation analysis.The TWAS detected 420 DCS genes with p < 0.05 in skeletal muscle, such as ribosomal protein S15A (RPS15A) (PTWAS = 0.001), and 110 genes in whole blood, such as selectin L (SELL) (PTWAS = 0.001). Comparison with the DCS RNA expression profile identified 12 common genes, including Apelin Receptor (APLNR) (PTWAS = 0.001, PDEG = 0.025). In total, 148 DCS-enriched Gene Ontology (GO) terms were identified, such as mast cell degranulation (GO:0043303); 15 DCS-enriched Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways were identified, such as the sphingolipid signalling pathway (ko04071). Nine terms, such as degradation of the extracellular matrix (R-HSA-1474228), were common to the TWAS enrichment results and the RNA expression profile.Our results identify putative susceptibility genes; these findings provide new ideas for exploration of the genetic mechanism of DCS development and new targets for preclinical intervention and clinical treatment.Cite this article:Bone Joint Res 2023;12(1):80-90."
"36638126","Plasma protein levels of young healthy pigs as indicators of disease resilience.","J Anim Sci","Selection for disease resilience, which refers to the ability of an animal to maintain performance when exposed to disease, can reduce the impact of infectious diseases. However, direct selection for disease resilience is challenging because nucleus herds must maintain a high health status. A possible solution is indirect selection of indicators of disease resilience. To search for such indicators, we conducted phenotypic and genetic quantitative analyses of the abundances of 377 proteins in plasma samples from 912 young and visually healthy pigs and their relationships with performance and subsequent disease resilience after natural exposure to a polymicrobial disease challenge. Abundances of 100 proteins were significantly heritable (false discovery rate (FDR) <0.10). The abundance of some proteins was or tended to be genetically correlated (rg) with disease resilience, including complement system proteins (rg = -0.24, FDR = 0.001) and IgG heavy chain proteins (rg = -0.68, FDR = 0.22). Gene set enrichment analyses (FDR < 0.2) based on phenotypic and genetic associations of protein abundances with subsequent disease resilience revealed many pathways related to the immune system that were unfavorably associated with subsequent disease resilience, especially the innate immune system. It was not possible to determine whether the observed levels of these proteins reflected baseline levels in these young and visually healthy pigs or were the result of a response to environmental disturbances that the pigs were exposed to before sample collection. Nevertheless, results show that, under these conditions, the abundance of proteins in some immune-related pathways can be used as phenotypic and genetic predictors of disease resilience and have the potential for use in pig breeding and management.© The Author(s) 2023.

However, whether the environment can alter an organism's phenotype across several generations through epigenetic remodeling in the germline is still a highly debated topic. In this chapter, we briefly review the mechanisms of epigenetic inheritance and their connection with germline development before highlighting specific developmental windows of susceptibility to environmental cues. We further discuss the evidence of transgenerational inheritance to a range of different environmental cues, both epidemiological in humans and experimental in rodent models. Doing so, we pinpoint the current challenges in demonstrating transgenerational inheritance to environmental cues and offer insight in how recent technological advances may help deciphering the epigenetic mechanisms at play. Together, we draw a detailed picture of how our environment can influence our epigenomes, ultimately reshaping our phenotypes, in an extended theory of inheritance.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

Fucosyltransferases (FUTs) are associated with numerous cancers. We aimed to investigate the functions of FUTs in COAD.Transcriptomic and clinical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases were used to analyze the expression and clinical relevance of FUTs in COAD. Real Time Quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), Western blot, immunohistochemistry and ELISA were used to detect the relative RNA and protein expression levels. Colitis-associated cancer mice treated with Fusobacterium nucleatum were used to illustrate the effects of Fusobacterium nucleatum on FUTs and COAD. Luciferase reporting assay was used to investigate the binding of miRNA to mRNA.TCGA and GEO datasets showed abnormal expression of FUTs in COAD at transcript level. RT-qPCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry showed increased expression of FUT1, POFUT1 and POFUT2 in COAD. COAD patients with a high expression of FUT1, FUT11, FUT13 (POFUT2) had a worse prognosis, while patients with a high expression of FUT2, FUT3, FUT6 had a better prognosis. FUT1 and POFUT2 could independently predict the prognosis of COAD patients. Functional analysis by CancerSEA database showed that FUT3, FUT6, FUT8, FUT12 (POFUT1) and FUT13 are associated with differentiation, apoptosis, invasion, quiescence, and hypoxia. FUTs are associated with the tumor microenvironment of COAD. FUT1 regulated by miR-939-3p inhibit the expression of MUC2. Fusobacterium nucleatum may affect the expression of FUTs by affecting their transcription factors and miRNA levels. Moreover, Fusobacterium nucleatum promotes COAD progression through the miR-939-3p/FUT1/MUC2 axis.Fucosyltransferases play an important role and may be the mediator of Fusobacterium nucleatum promoting COAD progression.© 2023 Wang et al."

"36839169",NA,NA,"A long-term complication of obesity is the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Patients with T2D have been described as having epigenetic modifications. Epigenetics is the post-transcriptional modification of DNA or associated factors containing genetic information. These environmentally-influenced modifications, maintained during cell division, cause stable changes in gene expression. Epigenetic modifications of T2D are DNA methylation, acetylation, ubiquitylation, SUMOylation, and phosphorylation at the lysine residue at the amino terminus of histones, affecting DNA, histones, and non-coding RNA. DNA methylation has been shown in pancreatic islets, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and the liver. Furthermore, epigenetic changes have been observed in chronic complications of T2D, such as diabetic nephropathy, diabetic retinopathy, and diabetic neuropathy. Recently, a new drug has been developed which acts on bromodomains and extraterminal (BET) domain proteins, which operate like epigenetic readers and communicate with chromatin to make DNA accessible for transcription by inhibiting them. This drug (apabetalone) is being studied to prevent major adverse cardiovascular events in people with T2D, low HDL cholesterol, chronic kidney failure, and recent coronary events. This review aims to describe the relationship between obesity, long-term complications such as T2D, and epigenetic modifications and their possible treatments."

However, the mechanisms and extent through which these loci contribute to subsequent outcomes remain elusive. We hypothesized that combinations of T2D-associated variants acting on tissue-specific regulatory elements might account for greater risk for tissue-specific outcomes, leading to diversity in T2D disease progression. We searched for T2D-associated variants acting on regulatory elements and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in nine tissues. We used T2D tissue-grouped variant sets as genetic instruments to conduct 2-Sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) in ten related outcomes whose risk is increased by T2D using the FinnGen cohort. We performed PheWAS analysis to investigate whether the T2D tissue-grouped variant sets had specific predicted disease signatures. We identified an average of 176 variants acting in nine tissues implicated in T2D, and an average of 30 variants acting on regulatory elements that are unique to the nine tissues of interest. In 2-Sample MR analyses, all subsets of regulatory variants acting in different tissues were associated with increased risk of the ten secondary outcomes studied on similar levels. No tissue-grouped variant set was associated with an outcome significantly more than other tissue-grouped variant sets. We did not identify different disease progression profiles based on tissue-specific regulatory and transcriptome information. Bigger sample sizes and other layers of regulatory information in critical tissues may help identify subsets of T2D variants that are implicated in certain secondary outcomes, uncovering system-specific disease progression.© 2023.

"36829050","Harnessing the potential of machine learning and artificial intelligence for dementia research.","Brain Inform","Progress in dementia research has been limited, with substantial gaps in our knowledge of targets for prevention, mechanisms for disease progression, and disease-modifying treatments. The growing availability of multimodal data sets opens possibilities for the application of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to help answer key questions in the field. We provide an overview of the state of the science, highlighting current challenges and opportunities for utilisation of AI approaches to move the field forward in the areas of genetics, experimental medicine, drug discovery and trials optimisation, imaging, and prevention. Machine learning methods can enhance results of genetic studies, help determine biological effects and facilitate the identification of drug targets based on genetic and transcriptomic information. The use of unsupervised learning for understanding disease mechanisms for drug discovery is promising, while analysis of multimodal data sets to characterise and quantify disease severity and subtype are also beginning to contribute to optimisation of clinical trial recruitment. Data-driven experimental medicine is needed to analyse data across modalities and develop novel algorithms to translate insights from animal models to human disease biology. AI methods in neuroimaging outperform traditional approaches for diagnostic classification, and although challenges around validation and translation remain, there is optimism for their meaningful integration to clinical practice in the near future. AI-based models can also clarify our understanding of the causality and commonality of dementia risk factors, informing and improving risk prediction models along with the development of preventative interventions. The complexity and heterogeneity of dementia requires an alternative approach beyond traditional design and analytical approaches.

We sought to identify genetic correlates of the age of onset by conducting the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) treating the age of first diagnosis as a quantitative trait.We performed GWAS with a discovery cohort of 4,014 cases and a replication cohort of 493 independent cases. Genome-wide significant SNPs were mapped to a causal variant by Bayesian conditional analysis and gel shift assay. The causal protein-coding gene was identified and characterized by RNA interference treatment of primary human pan-CD4+ T cells with RNA-seq of the transcriptome. The candidate gene was evaluated functionally in primary cells by CD69 staining and proliferation assays.Our GWAS replicated the known association of the age of diagnosis with the human leukocyte antigen complex (HLA-DQB1). The second signal identified was in an intron of the NELL1 gene on chromosome 11 and fine-mapped to variant rs10833518 (P < 1.54 × 10-9). Homozygosity for the risk allele leads to average age of onset one year earlier. Knock-down of HIV TAT-interacting protein 2 (HTATIP2), but not other genes in the locus, resulted in alterations to gene expression in signal transduction pathways including MAP kinases and PI3-kinase. Higher levels of HTATIP2 expression are associated with increased viability, proliferation, and activation of T cells in the presence of signals from antigen and cytokine receptors.This study implicates HTATIP2 as a new type 1 diabetes gene acting via T cell regulation. Larger population sample sizes are expected to reveal additional loci.Copyright © 2023 Cardinale, Chang, Wei, Qu, Bradfield, Polychronakos and Hakonarson."

We validate these factors by demonstrating the generalizability of the model to a semi-independent sample and show that the factors align with biologically and functionally relevant parcellations of the cortex. We apply Stratified Genomic SEM to identify specific categories of genes (e.g., neuronal cell types) that are disproportionately associated with pleiotropy across specific subclusters of brain regions, as indexed by the genomic factors. Finally, we examine genetic associations with psychiatric and cognitive correlates, finding that broad aspects of cognitive function are associated with a general factor for SA and that psychiatric associations are null.

Here, we introduce a statistical framework named X-Wing to improve predictive performance in ancestrally diverse populations. X-Wing quantifies local genetic correlations for complex traits between populations, employs an annotation-dependent estimation procedure to amplify correlated genetic effects between populations, and combines multiple population-specific PRS into a unified score with GWAS summary statistics alone as input. Through extensive benchmarking, we demonstrate that X-Wing pinpoints portable genetic effects and substantially improves PRS performance in non-European populations, showing 14.1%-119.1% relative gain in predictive R2compared to state-of-the-art methods based on GWAS summary statistics. Overall, X-Wing addresses critical limitations in existing approaches and may have broad applications in cross-population polygenic risk prediction.© 2023. The Author(s)."

However, it remains unknown to what extent transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) are under accelerated evolution in humans and other primates. Here, we introduce two pooling-based phylogenetic methods with dramatically enhanced sensitivity to examine accelerated evolution in TFBSs. Using these new methods, we show that more than 6000 TFBSs annotated in the human genome have experienced accelerated evolution in Hominini, apes, and Old World monkeys. Although these TFBSs individually show relatively weak signals of accelerated evolution, they collectively are more abundant than HARs. Also, we show that accelerated evolution in Pol III binding sites may be driven by lineage-specific positive selection, whereas accelerated evolution in other TFBSs might be driven by nonadaptive evolutionary forces. Finally, the accelerated TFBSs are enriched around developmental genes, suggesting that accelerated evolution in TFBSs may drive the divergence of developmental processes between primates.© 2023.

Sharp increases in cocaine use drive the urgent need for better mechanistic insight into this chronic relapsing brain disorder that currently lacks effective treatment options. To investigate the transcriptomic changes involved, we conducted RNA sequencing on two striatal brain regions that are heavily implicated in CUD, the nucleus accumbens and caudate nucleus, from men suffering from CUD and matched controls. Weighted gene coexpression analyses identified CUD-specific gene networks enriched in ionotropic receptors and linked to lowered neuroinflammation, contrasting the proinflammatory responses found in opioid use disorder. Integration of comprehensive transcriptomic datasets from mouse cocaine self-administration models revealed evolutionarily conserved gene networks in CUD that implicate especially D1 medium spiny neurons as drivers of cocaine-induced plasticity."

"36749789","PRSet: Pathway-based polygenic risk score analyses and software.","PLoS Genet","Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) have been among the leading advances in biomedicine in recent years. As a proxy of genetic liability, PRSs are utilised across multiple fields and applications. While numerous statistical and machine learning methods have been developed to optimise their predictive accuracy, these typically distil genetic liability to a single number based on aggregation of an individual's genome-wide risk alleles. This results in a key loss of information about an individual's genetic profile, which could be critical given the functional sub-structure of the genome and the heterogeneity of complex disease. In this manuscript, we introduce a 'pathway polygenic' paradigm of disease risk, in which multiple genetic liabilities underlie complex diseases, rather than a single genome-wide liability. We describe a method and accompanying software, PRSet, for computing and analysing pathway-based PRSs, in which polygenic scores are calculated across genomic pathways for each individual. We evaluate the potential of pathway PRSs in two distinct ways, creating two major sections: (1) In the first section, we benchmark PRSet as a pathway enrichment tool, evaluating its capacity to capture GWAS signal in pathways. We find that for target sample sizes of >10,000 individuals, pathway PRSs have similar power for evaluating pathway enrichment as leading methods MAGMA and LD score regression, with the distinct advantage of providing individual-level estimates of genetic liability for each pathway -opening up a range of pathway-based PRS applications, (2) In the second section, we evaluate the performance of pathway PRSs for disease stratification. We show that using a supervised disease stratification approach, pathway PRSs (computed by PRSet) outperform two standard genome-wide PRSs (computed by C+T and lassosum) for classifying disease subtypes in 20 of 21 scenarios tested. As the definition and functional annotation of pathways becomes increasingly refined, we expect pathway PRSs to offer key insights into the heterogeneity of complex disease and treatment response, to generate biologically tractable therapeutic targets from polygenic signal, and, ultimately, to provide a powerful path to precision medicine.Copyright: © 2023 Choi et al.

More effective therapeutics for OUD requires in-depth understanding of molecular changes supporting drug-taking and relapse. Recent efforts have helped advance these aims, but studies have been limited in number and scope. Here, we develop a brain reward circuit-wide atlas of opioid-induced transcriptional regulation by combining RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and heroin self-administration in male mice modeling multiple OUD-relevant conditions: acute heroin exposure, chronic heroin intake, context-induced drug-seeking following prolonged abstinence, and heroin-primed drug-seeking (i.e., ""relapse""). Bioinformatics analysis of this rich dataset identified numerous patterns of molecular changes, transcriptional regulation, brain-region-specific involvement in various aspects of OUD, and both region-specific and pan-circuit biological domains affected by heroin. Integrating RNAseq data with behavioral outcomes using factor analysis to generate an ""addiction index"" uncovered novel roles for particular brain regions in promoting addiction-relevant behavior, and implicated multi-regional changes in affected genes and biological processes. Comparisons with RNAseq and genome-wide association studies from humans with OUD reveal convergent molecular regulation that are implicated in drug-taking and relapse, and point to novel gene candidates with high therapeutic potential for OUD. These results outline broad molecular reprogramming that may directly promote the development and maintenance of OUD, and provide a foundational resource to the field for future research into OUD mechanisms and treatment strategies."

Of those, two genes, FMNL3 (P = 6.11 × 10-6) and AC058822.1 (P = 1.47 × 10-4), represent new associations. High FMNL3 expression has previously been linked to poor prognosis in several other cancers.

Furthermore, literature review and database query found further support for a biologically plausible link with cancer for genes CBLB, FMNL3, FGFR2, LSP1, MAP3K1, and SRGAP2C.Using extended gene-based aggregation tests including coding and regulatory variation, we report identification of plausible target genes for previously identified single-marker associations with BC as well as the discovery of novel genes implicated in BC development. Including multi ancestral cohorts in this study enabled the identification of otherwise missed disease associations as ESR1 (P = 1.31 × 10-5), demonstrating the importance of diversifying study cohorts.© 2023.

"36702127","Significance tests for R(2) of out-of-sample prediction using polygenic scores.","Am J Hum Genet","The coefficient of determination (R2) is a well-established measure to indicate the predictive ability of polygenic scores (PGSs). However, the sampling variance of R2is rarely considered so that 95% confidence intervals (CI) are not usually reported. Moreover, when comparisons are made between PGSs based on different discovery samples, the sampling covariance of R2is required to test the difference between them. Here, we show how to estimate the variance and covariance of R2values to assess the 95% CI and p value of the R2difference. We apply this approach to real data calculating PGSs in 28,880 European participants derived from UK Biobank (UKBB) and Biobank Japan (BBJ) GWAS summary statistics for cholesterol and BMI. We quantify the significantly higher predictive ability of UKBB PGSs compared to BBJ PGSs (p value 7.6e-31 for cholesterol and 1.4e-50 for BMI). A joint model of UKBB and BBJ PGSs significantly improves the predictive ability, compared to a model of UKBB PGS only (p value 3.5e-05 for cholesterol and 1.3e-28 for BMI). We also show that the predictive ability of regulatory SNPs is significantly enriched over non-regulatory SNPs for cholesterol (p value 8.9e-26 for UKBB and 3.8e-17 for BBJ). We suggest that the proposed approach (available in R package r2redux) should be used to test the statistical significance of difference between pairs of PGSs, which may help to draw a correct conclusion about the comparative predictive ability of PGSs.Copyright © 2023 American Society of Human Genetics.

"36839421","Association of Plant-Based and High-Protein Diets with a Lower Obesity Risk Defined by Fat Mass in Middle-Aged and Elderly Persons with a High Genetic Risk of Obesity.","Nutrients","Obesity has become a severe public health challenge globally. The present study aimed to identify separate and interactive dietary, genetic, and other factors that increase the risk of obesity as measured by body fat (BF) mass. We utilized a genome-wide association study to identify genetic variants associated with high fat mass (obesity;n= 10,502) and combined them to generate polygenic risk scores (PRS) of genetic variants interacting with each other in adults aged over 40 while excluding body-fat-related diseases in a city-hospital-based cohort (n= 53,828). It was validated in Ansan/Ansung plus rural cohorts (n= 13,007). We then evaluated dietary and lifestyle factors in subjects to assess what factors might help overcome a genetic propensity for higher BF. The three-SNP model included brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)_rs6265, fat-mass- and obesity-associated protein (FTO)_rs1421085, andSEC16B_rs509325. The genes with the minor alleles ofADCY3_rs6545790 andBAIAP2_rs35867081 increased their gene expression in the visceral and subcutaneous adipocytes, but their gene expression decreased in the hypothalamus in eQTL analysis. In the three-SNP model, the PRS was associated with BF mass by 1.408 and 1.396 times after adjusting covariates 1 (age, gender, survey year, residence area, education, and income) and 2 (covariates in model 1 plus energy intake, alcohol intake, regular exercise, and smoking status), respectively. However, when separating subjects by PRS of the three-SNP model, a plant-based diet was the most significant factor associated with low BF, followed by high-protein diets and lower energy intakes. They could offset the effects of high genetic risk for high BF. In conclusion, modulating nutrient intakes might overcome a high genetic risk for obesity. Dietary choices favoring more plant-based and higher-protein foods might help prevent increased BF in Asians and potentially people of other ethnicities with high polygenetic risk scores."

However, its action in the physiology of pancreatic β-cells is not fully understood. Herein, bioinformatics and genetic analyses on the publicly available database were performed to map the expression of theMAPK8IP1gene in human pancreatic islets and to explore whether this gene contains any genetic variants associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Moreover, a series of functional experiments were executed in a rat insulinoma cell line (INS-1 832/13) to investigate the role of theMapk8ip1gene in β-cell function. Metabolic engineering using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data confirmed higher expression levels ofMAPK8IP1in human islets compared to other metabolic tissues. Additionally, comparable expression of MAPK8IP1 expression was detected in sorted human endocrine cells. However, β-cells exhibited higher expression of MAPK8IP1 than ductal and PSC cells. Notably,MAPK8IP1expression was reduced in diabetic islets, and the expression was positively correlated with insulin and the β-cell transcription factorPDX1andMAFA.Using the TIGER portal, we found that one genetic variant, ""rs7115753,"" in the proximity of MAPK8IP1, passes the genome-wide significance for the association with T2D. Expression silencing ofMapk8ip1by small interfering RNA (siRNA) in INS-1 cells reduced insulin secretion, glucose uptake rate, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. In contrast, insulin content, cell viability, and apoptosis without cytokines were unaffected. However, silencing ofMapk8ip1reduced cytokines-induced apoptosis and downregulated the expression of several pancreatic β-cell functional markers including,Ins1,Ins2,Pdx1,MafA,Glut2,Gck,Insr,Vamp2,Syt5, andCacna1aat mRNA and/or protein levels. Finally, we reported that siRNA silencing ofPdx1resulted in the downregulation of MAPK8IP1 expression in INS-1 cells. In conclusion, our findings confirmed that MAPK8IP1 is an important component of pancreatic β-cell physiology and insulin secretion."
"36833225","The Role of IRX Homeobox Genes in Hematopoietic Progenitors and Leukemia.","Genes (Basel)","IRX genes are members of the TALE homeobox gene class and encode six related transcription factors (IRX1-IRX6) controlling development and cell differentiation of several tissues in humans. Classification of TALE homeobox gene expression patterns for the hematopoietic compartment, termed TALE-code, has revealed exclusive IRX1 activity in pro-B-cells and megakaryocyte erythroid progenitors (MEPs), highlighting its specific contribution to developmental processes at these early stages of hematopoietic lineage differentiation. Moreover, aberrant expression of IRX homeobox genes IRX1, IRX2, IRX3 and IRX5 has been detected in hematopoietic malignancies, including B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL), T-cell ALL, and some subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Expression analyses of patient samples and experimental studies using cell lines and mouse models have revealed oncogenic functions in cell differentiation arrest and upstream and downstream genes, thus, revealing normal and aberrant regulatory networks. These studies have shown how IRX genes play key roles in the development of both normal blood and immune cells, and hematopoietic malignancies. Understanding their biology serves to illuminate developmental gene regulation in the hematopoietic compartment, and may improve diagnostic classification of leukemias in the clinic and reveal new therapeutic targets and strategies."
"36865550","Exploring the association and causal effect between white blood cells and psoriasis using large-scale population data.","Front Immunol","Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the skin. A few studies have shown that psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease in which multiple immune cells play crucial roles. However, the association between circulating immune cells and psoriasis remains elusive.To explore the role of circulating immune cells in psoriasis, 361,322 individuals from the UK Biobank (UKB) and 3,971 patients with psoriasis from China were included to investigate the association between white blood cells and psoriasisviaan observational study. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and Mendelian randomization (MR) were used to evaluate the causal relationship between circulating leukocytes and psoriasis.The risk of psoriasis increased with high levels of monocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils (relative risks and 95% confidence intervals, respectively: 1.430 (1.291-1.584) for monocytes, 1.527 (1.379-1.692) for neutrophils, and 1.417 (1.294-1.551) for eosinophils). Upon further MR analysis, eosinophils showed a definite causal relationship with psoriasis (odds ratio of inverse-variance weighted: 1.386, 95% confidence intervals: 1.092-1.759) and a positive correlation with the psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) score (P= 6.6 × 10-5). The roles of the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and lymphocyte-monocyte ratio (LMR) in psoriasis were also assessed. More than 20,000 genetic variations associated with NLR, PLR, and LMR were discovered in a GWAS analysis using the UKB data. Following adjustment for covariates in the observational study, NLR and PLR were shown to be risk factors for psoriasis, whereas LMR was a protective factor. MR results indicated that there was no causal relationship between these three indicators and psoriasis; however, NLR, PLR, and LMR correlated with the PASI score (NLR: rho = 0.244,P= 2.1 × 10-21; PLR: rho = 0.113,P= 1.4 × 10-5; LMR: rho = -0.242,P= 3.5×10-21).Our findings revealed an important association between circulating leukocytes and psoriasis, which is instructive for the clinical practice of psoriasis treatment.Copyright © 2023 Zhou, Ren, Tang, Li, Chen, He, Wei, Zhang, Ma, Chen, Zhang, Shen and Liu."
"36854754","A clustering linear combination method for multiple phenotype association studies based on GWAS summary statistics.","Sci Rep","There is strong evidence showing that joint analysis of multiple phenotypes in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) can increase statistical power when detecting the association between genetic variants and human complex diseases. We previously developed the Clustering Linear Combination (CLC) method and a computationally efficient CLC (ceCLC) method to test the association between multiple phenotypes and a genetic variant, which perform very well. However, both of these methods require individual-level genotypes and phenotypes that are often not easily accessible. In this research, we develop a novel method called sCLC for association studies of multiple phenotypes and a genetic variant based on GWAS summary statistics. We use the LD score regression to estimate the correlation matrix among phenotypes. The test statistic of sCLC is constructed by GWAS summary statistics and has an approximate Cauchy distribution. We perform a variety of simulation studies and compare sCLC with other commonly used methods for multiple phenotype association studies using GWAS summary statistics. Simulation results show that sCLC can control Type I error rates well and has the highest power in most scenarios. Moreover, we apply the newly developed method to the UK Biobank GWAS summary statistics from the XIII category with 70 related musculoskeletal system and connective tissue phenotypes. The results demonstrate that sCLC detects the most number of significant SNPs, and most of these identified SNPs can be matched to genes that have been reported in the GWAS catalog to be associated with those phenotypes. Furthermore, sCLC also identifies some novel signals that were missed by standard GWAS, which provide new insight into the potential genetic factors of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue phenotypes.© 2023.

We used large-scale GWAS summary statistics on migraine, headache, and nine glycemic traits in European populations to perform cross-trait analyses to estimate genetic correlation, identify shared genomic regions, loci, genes, and pathways, and test for causal relationships. Out of the nine glycemic traits, significant genetic correlation was observed for fasting insulin (FI) and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) with both migraine and headache, while 2-h glucose was genetically correlated only with migraine. Among 1703 linkage disequilibrium (LD) independent regions of the genome, we found pleiotropic regions between migraine and FI, fasting glucose (FG), and HbA1c, and pleiotropic regions between headache and glucose, FI, HbA1c, and fasting proinsulin. Cross-trait GWAS meta-analysis with glycemic traits, identified six novel genome-wide significant lead SNPs with migraine, and six novel lead SNPs with headache (Pmeta < 5.0 × 10-8and Psingle-trait < 1 × 10-4), all of which were LD-independent. Genes with a nominal gene-based association (Pgene ≤ 0.05) were significantly enriched (overlapping) across the migraine, headache, and glycemic traits. Mendelian randomisation analyses produced intriguing, but inconsistent, evidence for a causal relationship between migraine and headache with multiple glycemic traits; and consistent evidence suggesting increased fasting proinsulin levels may causally decrease the risk of headache. Our findings indicate that migraine, headache, and glycemic traits share a common genetic etiology and provide genetic insights into the molecular mechanisms contributing to their comorbid relationship.© 2023.

In the current meta-analysis, we synthesized the literature on (1) the contribution of genetic and environmental factors to NDDs, (2) the genetic and environmental overlap between different NDDs, and (3) the co-occurrence between NDDs and disruptive, impulse control and conduct disorders (DICCs). Searches were conducted across three platforms: Web of Science, Ovid Medline and Ovid Embase. Studies were included only if 75% or more of the sample consisted of children and/or adolescents and the studies had measured the aetiology of NDDs and DICCs using single-generation family designs or genomic methods. Studies that had selected participants on the basis of unrelated diagnoses or injuries were excluded. We performed multilevel, random-effects meta-analyses on 296 independent studies, including over four million (partly overlapping) individuals. We further explored developmental trajectories and the moderating roles of gender, measurement, geography and ancestry. We found all NDDs to be substantially heritable (family-based heritability, 0.66 (s.e. = 0.03); SNP heritability, 0.19 (s.e. = 0.03)). Meta-analytic genetic correlations between NDDs were moderate (grand family-based genetic correlation, 0.36 (s.e. = 0.12); grand SNP-based genetic correlation, 0.39 (s.e. = 0.19)) but differed substantially between pairs of disorders. The genetic overlap between NDDs and DICCs was strong (grand family-based genetic correlation, 0.62 (s.e. = 0.20)). While our work provides evidence to inform and potentially guide clinical and educational diagnostic procedures and practice, it also highlights the imbalance in the research effort that has characterized developmental genetics research.© 2023.

Data from glycemic-related traits GWAS (in up to 200,622 individuals) and sex hormones GWAS (in 189,473 women) in the UK Biobank (UKB) were used in the MR mediation analysis to assess potential mediating roles of these molecules in the causal pathway between NAFLD and PCOS. Replication analysis was conducted using two independent datasets from NAFLD and PCOS GWASs in the UKB and a meta-analysis of data from FinnGen and the Estonian Biobank, respectively. A linkage disequilibrium score regression was conducted to assess genetic correlations between NAFLD, PCOS, glycemic-related traits, and sex hormones using full summary statistics.Individuals with higher genetic liability to NAFLD were more likely to develop PCOS (OR per one-unit log odds increase in NAFLD: 1.10, 95% CI: 1.02-1.18; P = 0.013). Indirect causal effects of NAFLD on PCOS via fasting insulin only (OR: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01-1.03; P = 0.004) and further a suggestive indirect causal effect via fasting insulin in concert with androgen levels were revealed in MR mediation analyses. However, the conditional F statistics of NAFLD and fasting insulin were less than 10, suggesting likely weak instrument bias in the MVMR and MR mediation analyses.Our study suggests that genetically predicted NAFLD was associated with a higher risk of developing PCOS but less evidence for vice versa. Fasting insulin and sex hormones might mediate the link between NAFLD and PCOS.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36798334","Time-varying effects are common in genetic control of gestational duration.","medRxiv","Preterm birth is a major burden to neonatal health worldwide, determined in part by genetics. Recently, studies discovered several genes associated with this trait or its continuous equivalent - gestational duration. However, their effect timing, and thus clinical importance, is still unclear. Here, we use genotyping data of 31,000 births from the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child cohort (MoBa) to investigate different models of the genetic pregnancy ""clock"". We conduct genome-wide association studies using gestational duration or preterm birth, replicating known maternal associations and finding one new foetal variant. We illustrate how the interpretation of these results is complicated by the loss of power when dichotomizing. Using flexible survival models, we resolve this complexity and find that many of the known loci have time-varying effects, often stronger early in pregnancy. The overall polygenic control of birth timing appears to be shared in the term and preterm, but not very preterm periods, and exploratory results suggest involvement of the major histocompatibility complex genes in the latter. These findings show that the known gestational duration loci are clinically relevant, and should help design further experimental studies."

However, existing genetic risk scores (GRS) only provide a few percent predictive power for osteoporotic fracture.We derived and validated a novel genome-wide polygenic score (GPS) comprised of 103,155 common genetic variants to quantify this susceptibility and tested this GPS prediction ability in an independent dataset (n = 15,776).Among postmenopausal women, we found a fivefold gradient in the risk of major osteoporotic fracture (MOF) (p < 0.001) and a 15.25-fold increased risk of severe osteoporosis (p < 0.001) across the GPS deciles. Compared with the remainder of the GPS distribution, the top GPS decile was associated with a 3.59-, 2.48-, 1.92-, and 1.58-fold increased risk of any fracture, MOF, hip fracture, and spine fracture, respectively. The top GPS decile also identified nearly twofold more high-risk osteoporotic patients than the top decile of conventional GRS based on 1103 conditionally independent genome-wide significant SNPs. Although the relative risk of severe osteoporosis for postmenopausal women at around 50 is relatively similar, the cumulative incident at 20-year follow-up is significantly different between the top GPS decile (13.7%) and the bottom decile (< 1%). In the subgroup analysis, the GPS transferability in non-Hispanic White is better than in other racial/ethnic groups.This new method to quantify inherited susceptibility to osteoporosis and osteoporotic fracture affords new opportunities for clinical prevention and risk assessment.© 2023.

Finally, we examined associations between smoking genetic risk scores (GRS) and smoking traits with measured IOP and OAG in Rotterdam Study participants.We identified weak inverse rg between smoking- and glaucoma-related traits that were insignificant after Bonferroni correction. However, MR analysis revealed that genetically predicted smoking initiation was associated with lower IOP (-0.18 mm Hg per SD, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.30 to -0.06, P = 0.003). Furthermore, genetically predicted smoking intensity was associated with decreased OAG risk (odds ratio [OR] = 0.74 per SD, 95% CI = 0.61 to 0.90, P = 0.002). In the Rotterdam Study, the smoking initiation GRS was associated with lower IOP (-0.09 mm Hg per SD, 95% CI = -0.17 to -0.01, P = 0.04) and lower odds of OAG (OR = 0.84 per SD, 95% CI = 0.73 to 0.98, P = 0.02) in multivariable-adjusted analyses. In contrast, neither smoking history nor CPD was associated with IOP (P ≥ 0.38) or OAG (P ≥ 0.54). Associations between the smoking intensity GRS and glaucoma traits were null (P ≥ 0.13).MR experiments and GRS generated from Rotterdam Study participants support an inverse relationship between smoking and glaucoma.Understanding the genetic drivers of the inverse relationship between smoking and glaucoma could yield new insights into glaucoma pathophysiology."

The aim of this study is to apply cross-trait genetic analyses to investigate the potentially shared biology among PD, T2D, and bone mineral density (BMD) by assessing pairwise genetic correlations and searching for shared polymorphisms.We applied cross-trait genetic analyses leveraging genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics for: Periodontitis/loose teeth from the UKBB/GLIDE consortium (PerioLT, N=506594), T2D from the DIAGRAM consortium (Neff=228825), and BMD from the GEFOS consortium (N=426824). Among all three, pair-wise genetic correlations were estimated with linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression. Multi-trait meta-analysis of GWAS (MTAG) and colocalization analyses were performed to discover shared genome-wide significant variants (pMTAG<5x10-8). For replication, we conducted independent genetic analyses in the Women's Genome Health Study (WGHS), a prospective cohort study of middle-aged women of whom 14711 provided self-reported periodontal disease diagnosis, oral health measures, and periodontal risk factor data including incident T2D.Significant genetic correlations were identified between PerioLT/T2D (Rg=0.23; SE=0.04; p=7.4e-09) and T2D/BMD (Rg=0.09; SE=0.02; p=9.8e-06). Twenty-one independent pleiotropic variants were identifiedviaMTAG (pMTAG<5x10-8across all traits). Of these variants, genetic signals for PerioLT and T2D colocalized at one candidate variant (rs17522122; ProbH4 =0.58), a 3'UTR variant ofAKAP6. Colocalization between T2D/BMD and the original PerioLT GWAS p-values suggested 14 additional loci. In the independent WGHS sample, which includes responses to a validated oral health questionnaire for PD surveillance, the primary shared candidate (rs17522122) was associated with less frequent dental flossing [OR(95%CI)= 0.92 (0.87-0.98), p=0.007], a response that is correlated with worse PD status. Moreover, 4 additional candidate variants were indirectly supported by associations with less frequent dental flossing [rs75933965, 1.17(1.04-1.31), p=0.008], less frequent dental visits [rs77464186, 0.82(0.75-0.91), p=0.0002], less frequent dental prophylaxis [rs67111375, 0.91(0.83-0.99), p=0.03; rs77464186, 0.80(0.72-0.89), p=3.8e-05], or having bone loss around teeth [rs8047395, 1.09(1.03-1.15), p=0.005].This integrative approach identified one colocalized locus and 14 additional candidate loci that are shared between T2D and PD/oral health by comparing effects across PD, T2D and BMD.

Barley has strong salt tolerance, however, the underlying genetic basis is not fully clear, especially in the seedling stage. This study examined the ionic changes in barley core germplasms under the control and salt conditions. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis revealed 54 significant SNPs from a pool of 25,342 SNPs distributed in 7 chromosomes (Chr) of the Illumina Barley 50K SNP array. These SNPs are associated with ion homeostasis traits, sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) content, and Na+/K+ratio representing five genomic regions on Chr 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 in the leaves of worldwide barley accessions. And there are 3 SNP peaks located on the Chr 4, 6, and 7, which could be the ""hot spots"" regions for mining and identifying candidate genes for salt tolerance. Furthermore, 616 unique candidate genes were screened surrounding the significant SNPs, which are associated with transport proteins, protein kinases, binding proteins, and other proteins of unknown function. Meanwhile, transcriptomic analysis (RNA-Seq) was carried out to compare the salt-tolerant (CM72) and salt-sensitive (Gairdner) genotypes subjected to salt stress. And there was a greater accumulation of differentially expressed genes(DEGs) in Gairdner compared to CM72, mainly enriched in metabolic pathway, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, photosynthesis, signal transduction,emphasizing the different transcriptional response in both genotypes following salt exposure. Combined GWAS and RNA-Seq analysis revealed 5 promising salt-responding genes (PGK2, BASS3, SINAT2, AQP, and SYT3) from the hot spot regions, which were verified between the salt-tolerant and salt-sensitive varieties by qRT-PCR. In all, these results provide candidate SNPs and genes responsible for salinity responding in barley, and a new idea for studying such genetic basis in similar crops.Copyright © 2023 Xu, Meng, Zhu, Di, Zhu, Yang and Yan."
"36777179","Global Biobank analyses provide lessons for developing polygenic risk scores across diverse cohorts.","Cell Genom","Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) have been widely explored in precision medicine. However, few studies have thoroughly investigated their best practices in global populations across different diseases. We here utilized data from Global Biobank Meta-analysis Initiative (GBMI) to explore methodological considerations and PRS performance in 9 different biobanks for 14 disease endpoints. Specifically, we constructed PRSs using pruning and thresholding (P + T) and PRS-continuous shrinkage (CS). For both methods, using a European-based linkage disequilibrium (LD) reference panel resulted in comparable or higher prediction accuracy compared with several other non-European-based panels. PRS-CS overall outperformed the classic P + T method, especially for endpoints with higher SNP-based heritability. Notably, prediction accuracy is heterogeneous across endpoints, biobanks, and ancestries, especially for asthma, which has known variation in disease prevalence across populations. Overall, we provide lessons for PRS construction, evaluation, and interpretation using GBMI resources and highlight the importance of best practices for PRS in the biobank-scale genomics era.© 2022 The Author(s)."

However, the degree to which the shared genetic determinants are involved in these associations underlying the GBA is unclear.To investigate the shared genetic etiology between gastrointestinal tract diseases and psychiatric disorders and to identify shared genomic loci, genes, and pathways.This genome-wide pleiotropic association study using genome-wide association summary statistics from publicly available data sources was performed with various statistical genetic approaches to sequentially investigate the pleiotropic associations from genome-wide single-nucleotide variation (SNV; formerly single-nucleotide polymorphism [SNP]), and gene levels and biological pathways to disentangle the underlying shared genetic etiology between 4 gastrointestinal tract diseases (inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, peptic ulcer disease, and gastroesophageal reflux disease) and 6 psychiatric disorders (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and anorexia nervosa). Data were collected from March 10, 2021, to August 25, 2021, and analysis was performed from January 8 through May 30, 2022.The primary outcomes consisted of a list of genetic loci, genes, and pathways shared between gastrointestinal tract diseases and psychiatric disorders.Extensive genetic correlations and genetic overlaps were found among 22 of 24 trait pairs. Pleiotropic analysis under a composite null hypothesis identified 2910 significant potential pleiotropic SNVs in 19 trait pairs, with 83 pleiotropic loci and 24 colocalized loci detected. Gene-based analysis found 158 unique candidate pleiotropic genes, which were highly enriched in certain GBA-related phenotypes and tissues, whereas pathway enrichment analysis further highlighted biological pathways primarily involving cell adhesion, synaptic structure and function, and immune cell differentiation. Several identified pleiotropic loci also shared causal variants with gut microbiomes. Mendelian randomization analysis further illustrated vertical pleiotropy across 8 pairwise traits. Notably, many pleiotropic loci were identified for multiple pairwise traits, such as 1q32.1 (INAVA), 19q13.33 (FUT2), 11q23.2 (NCAM1), and 1p32.3 (LRP8).These findings suggest that the pleiotropic genetic determinants between gastrointestinal tract diseases and psychiatric disorders are extensively distributed across the genome. These findings not only support the shared genetic basis underlying the GBA but also have important implications for intervention and treatment targets of these diseases simultaneously."

First, we compare the relationship between EA and seventeen psychiatric diagnoses within sibship in Dutch national registry data (N = 1.7 million), controlling for unmeasured familial factors. Second, we use two-sample Mendelian Randomization, which uses genetic variants related to EA or psychiatric diagnosis as instrumental variables, to test whether there is a causal relation in either direction. Our results suggest that lower levels of EA causally increase the risk of MDD, ADHD, alcohol dependence, GAD and PTSD diagnoses. We also find evidence of a causal effect in the opposite direction for ADHD. Additionally, we find inconsistent results for schizophrenia, anorexia nervosa, OCD, and bipolar disorder, highlighting the importance of using multiple research designs to understand the complex relationship between EA and mental health."
"36717884","Genetic association and causal inference between lung function and venous thromboembolism.","Respir Res","Previous studies have indicated that lower lung function is related to a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). However, causal inferences may be affected by confounders, coheritability or reverse causality. We aimed to explore the causal association between lung function and VTE.Summary data from public genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for lung function and VTE were obtained from published meta-analysis studies and the FinnGen consortium, respectively. Independent genetic variables significantly related to exposure were filtered as proxy instruments. We adopted linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) and two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to infer the genetic backgrounds and causal associations between different lung functions and VTE events.LDSC showed a genetic correlation between forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (rg = - 0.189, P = 0.005). In univariate MR (UVMR), there was suggestive evidence for causal associations of genetically predicted force vital capacity (FVC) with DVT (odds ratio (OR) 0.774; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.641-0.934) via forwards analysis and genetically predicted pulmonary embolism (PE) with FVC (OR 0.989; 95% CI 0.979-0.999) via reverse analysis. Multivariate MR (MVMR) analyses of lung function-specific SNPs suggested no significant direct effects of lung function on VTE, and vice versa. Of note is the borderline causal effect of PE on FEV1 (OR 0.921; 95% CI 0.848-1.000).Our findings identified a coheritability of FEV1 (significant) and FVC (suggestive) with DVT. There was no convincing causal relationship between lung function and the risk of VTE events. The borderline causal effect of PE on FEV1 and the significant genetic correlation of FEV1 with DVT may have clinical implications for improving the quality of existing prevention and intervention strategies.© 2023.

Yet the extent and impact of phenotypic misclassification on large-scale datasets is not currently well understood due to a lack of statistical methods to estimate relevant parameters from empirical data. Here, we develop a statistical method and scalable software, PheMED, Phe notypic M easurement of E ffective D ilution, to quantify phenotypic misclassification across GWAS using only summary statistics. We illustrate how the parameters estimated by PheMED relate to the negative and positive predictive value of the labeled phenotype, compared to ground truth, and how misclassification of the phenotype yields diluted effect-sizes of variant-phenotype associations. Furthermore, we apply our methodology to detect multiple instances of statistically significant dilution in real-world data. We demonstrate how effective dilution biases downstream GWAS replication and heritability analyses despite utilizing current best practices, and provide a dilution-aware meta-analysis approach that outperforms existing methods. Consequently, we anticipate that PheMED will be a valuable tool for researchers to address phenotypic data quality issues both within and across cohorts."

While over 1,000 genetic loci are associated with BMI, less is known about the genetic contribution to adiposity trajectories over adulthood. We derive adiposity-change phenotypes from 1.5 million primary-care health records in over 177,000 individuals in UK Biobank to study the genetic architecture of weight-change. Using multiple BMI measurements over time increases power to identify genetic factors affecting baseline BMI. In the largest reported genome-wide study of adiposity-change in adulthood, we identify novel associations with BMI-change at six independent loci, including rs429358 (a missense variant inAPOE). The SNP-based heritability of BMI-change (1.98%) is 9-fold lower than that of BMI, and higher in women than in men. The modest genetic correlation between BMI-change and BMI (45.2%) indicates that genetic studies of longitudinal trajectories could uncover novel biology driving quantitative trait values in adulthood."

Here, we characterise the genetic architecture of blood glucose variably measured within 0 and 24 h of fasting in 368,000 European ancestry participants of the UK Biobank. We found a near-linear increase in the heritability of non-fasting glucose levels over time, which plateaus to its fasting state value after 5 h post meal (h2 = 11%; standard error: 1%). The genetic correlation between different fasting times is > 0.77, suggesting that the genetic control of glucose is largely constant across fasting durations. Accounting for heritability differences between fasting times leads to a ~16% improvement in the discovery of genetic variants associated with glucose. Newly detected variants improve the prediction of fasting glucose and type 2 diabetes in independent samples. Finally, we meta-analysed summary statistics from genome-wide association studies of random and fasting glucose (N = 518,615) and identified 156 independent SNPs explaining 3% of fasting glucose variance. Altogether, our study demonstrates the utility of random glucose measures to improve the discovery of genetic variants associated with glucose homeostasis, even in fasting conditions.© 2023.

"36687396","Genetic overlap between Parkinson's disease and inflammatory bowel disease.","Brain Commun","Parkinson's disease and inflammatory bowel disease have been increasingly associated, implying shared pathophysiology. To explore biological explanations for the reported connection, we leveraged summary statistics of updated genome-wide association studies and characterized the genetic overlap between the two diseases. Aggregated genetic association data were available for 37 688 cases versus 981 372 controls for Parkinson's disease and 25 042 cases versus 34 915 controls for inflammatory bowel disease. Genetic correlation was estimated with the high-definition likelihood method. Genetic variants with joint association to both diseases were identified by conditional false discovery rate framework and further annotated to reveal shared loci, genes, and enriched pathways. For both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, the two main subtypes of inflammatory bowel disease, we detected weak but statistically significant genetic correlations with Parkinson's disease (Crohn's disease:rg= 0.06,P= 0.01; ulcerative colitis:rg= 0.06,P= 0.03). A total of 1290 variants in 27 independent genomic loci were detected to associate with Parkinson's disease and Crohn's disease at conjunctional false discovery rate under 0.01 and 1359 variants in 15 loci were pleiotropic to Parkinson's disease and ulcerative colitis. Among the identified pleiotropic loci, 23 are novel and have never been associated with both phenotypes. A mixture of loci conferring either same or opposing genetic effects on two phenotypes was also observed. Positional and expression quantitative trait loci mapping prioritized 296 and 253 genes for Parkinson's disease with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, respectively, among which only <10% are differentially expressed in both colon and substantia nigra. These genes were identified to overrepresent in pathways regulating gene expression and post-translational modification beyond several immune-related pathways enriched by major histocompatibility complex genes. In conclusion, we found robust evidence for a genetic link between Parkinson's disease and inflammatory bowel disease. The identified genetic overlap is complex at the locus and gene levels, indicating the presence of both synergistic and antagonistic pleiotropy. At the functional level, our findings implied a role of immune-centered mechanisms in the reported gut-brain connection.© The Author(s) 2023.

The aim of this study was to investigate the shared genetic component between longevity and two age-related conditions.We performed a cross-trait meta-analysis of publicly available genome-wide data for Alzheimer's disease, coronary artery disease and longevity using a subset-based approach provided by the R package ASSET.Despite the lack of strong genetic correlation between longevity and the two diseases, we identified 38 genome-wide significant lead SNPs across 22 independent genomic loci. Of them 6 were found to be potentially shared among the three traits mapping to genes includingDAB2IP, DNM2, FCHO1, CLPTM1, andSNRPD2. We also identified 19 novel genome-wide associations for the individual traits in this study. Functional annotations and biological pathway enrichment analyses suggested that pleiotropic variants are involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and plasma lipoprotein and neurotransmitter clearance processes.In summary, we have been able to advance in the knowledge of the genetic overlap existing among longevity and the two most common age-related disorders.Copyright © 2023 Bellou and Escott-Price."

Beyond severe physical symptoms, endometriosis is also associated with several psychiatric comorbidities, including depression and anxiety.To investigate whether pleiotropy contributes to the association of endometriosis with depression, anxiety, and eating disorders.This genetic association study was performed between September 13, 2021, and June 24, 2022, in 202 276 unrelated female participants. Genotypic and phenotypic information from the UK Biobank was combined with genome-wide association statistics available from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (11 countries), the Million Veteran Program (US), the FinnGen study (Finland), and the CHARGE (Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology) consortium (5 countries).The main outcomes were the phenotypic and genetic associations of endometriosis with anxiety, depression, and eating disorders.A total of 8276 women with endometriosis (mean [SD] age, 53.1 [7.9] years) and 194 000 female controls (mean [SD] age, 56.7 [7.9] years) were included in the study. In a multivariate regression analysis accounting for age, body mass index, socioeconomic status, chronic pain-related phenotypes, irritable bowel syndrome, and psychiatric comorbidities, endometriosis was associated with increased odds of depression (odds ratio [OR], 3.61; 95% CI, 3.32-3.92), eating disorders (OR, 2.94; 95% CI, 1.96-4.41), and anxiety (OR, 2.61; 95% CI, 2.30-2.97). These associations were supported by consistent genetic correlations (rg) (depression rg, 0.36, P = 1.5 × 10-9; anxiety rg, 0.33, P = 1.17 × 10-5; and eating disorders rg, 0.61, P = .02). With the application of a 1-sample mendelian randomization, the genetic liabilities to depression and anxiety were associated with increased odds of endometriosis (depression: OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.08-1.11; anxiety: OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.13-1.65). A genome-wide analysis of pleiotropic associations shared between endometriosis and psychiatric disorders identified 1 locus, DGKB rs12666606, with evidence of pleiotropy between endometriosis and depression after multiple testing correction (z = -9.46 for endometriosis, z = 8.10 for depression, P = 5.56 × 10-8; false discovery rate q = 4.95 × 10-4).These findings highlight that endometriosis is associated with women's mental health through pleiotropic mechanisms. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale study to provide genetic and phenotypic evidence of the processes underlying the psychiatric comorbidities of endometriosis."

A traditional tool for quality control and identification of significant regions has been a visual inspection of how significant and correlated genetic variants cluster within a region. However, while inspecting hundreds of regions, this subjective method can misattribute significance to some loci or neglect others that are significant.The GWAS quality score (GQS) identifies suspicious regions and prevents erroneous interpretations with an objective, quantitative and automated method. The GQS assesses all measured single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are linked by inheritance to each other [linkage disequilibrium (LD)] and compares the significance of trait association of each SNP to its LD value for the reported index SNP. A GQS value of 1.0 ascribes a high level of confidence to the entire region and its underlying gene(s), while GQS values <1.0 indicate the need to closely inspect the outliers. We applied the GQS to published and non-published genome-wide summary statistics and report suspicious regions requiring secondary inspection while supporting the majority of reported regions from large-scale published meta-analyses.The GQS code/scripts can be cloned from GitHub (https://github.com/Xswapnil/GQS/). The analyst can use whole-genome summary statistics to estimate GQS for each defined region. We also provide an online tool (http://35.227.18.38/) that gives access to the GQS.

"36640404","New insights from the last decade of research in psychiatric genetics: discoveries, challenges and clinical implications.","World Psychiatry","Psychiatric genetics has made substantial progress in the last decade, providing new insights into the genetic etiology of psychiatric disorders, and paving the way for precision psychiatry, in which individual genetic profiles may be used to personalize risk assessment and inform clinical decision-making. Long recognized to be heritable, recent evidence shows that psychiatric disorders are influenced by thousands of genetic variants acting together. Most of these variants are commonly occurring, meaning that every individual has a genetic risk to each psychiatric disorder, from low to high. A series of large-scale genetic studies have discovered an increasing number of common and rare genetic variants robustly associated with major psychiatric disorders. The most convincing biological interpretation of the genetic findings implicates altered synaptic function in autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. However, the mechanistic understanding is still incomplete. In line with their extensive clinical and epidemiological overlap, psychiatric disorders appear to exist on genetic continua and share a large degree of genetic risk with one another. This provides further support to the notion that current psychiatric diagnoses do not represent distinct pathogenic entities, which may inform ongoing attempts to reconceptualize psychiatric nosology. Psychiatric disorders also share genetic influences with a range of behavioral and somatic traits and diseases, including brain structures, cognitive function, immunological phenotypes and cardiovascular disease, suggesting shared genetic etiology of potential clinical importance. Current polygenic risk score tools, which predict individual genetic susceptibility to illness, do not yet provide clinically actionable information. However, their precision is likely to improve in the coming years, and they may eventually become part of clinical practice, stressing the need to educate clinicians and patients about their potential use and misuse. This review discusses key recent insights from psychiatric genetics and their possible clinical applications, and suggests future directions.© 2023 World Psychiatric Association."

Even when there is a demonstrated connection between a demographic expansion of people, the spread of agriculture, and the spread of a particular language family, the outcome in the results of contact between expanding and resident groups is highly variable.

"36629266","Hypothesis-driven probabilistic modelling enables a principled perspective of genomic compartments.","Nucleic Acids Res","The Hi-C method has revolutionized the study of genome organization, yet interpretation of Hi-C interaction frequency maps remains a major challenge. Genomic compartments are a checkered Hi-C interaction pattern suggested to represent the partitioning of the genome into two self-interacting states associated with active and inactive chromatin. Based on a few elementary mechanistic assumptions, we derive a generative probabilistic model of genomic compartments, called deGeco. Testing our model, we find it can explain observed Hi-C interaction maps in a highly robust manner, allowing accurate inference of interaction probability maps from extremely sparse data without any training of parameters. Taking advantage of the interpretability of the model parameters, we then test hypotheses regarding the nature of genomic compartments. We find clear evidence of multiple states, and that these states self-interact with different affinities. We also find that the interaction rules of chromatin states differ considerably within and between chromosomes. Inspecting the molecular underpinnings of a four-state model, we show that a simple classifier can use histone marks to predict the underlying states with 87% accuracy. Finally, we observe instances of mixed-state loci and analyze these loci in single-cell Hi-C maps, finding that mixing of states occurs mainly at the cell level.© The Author(s) 2023.

Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified NTN1 gene as a high-priority candidate of NSCL/P, the comprehensive genetic architecture of NTN1 weren't yet known. Thus, this study aimed to determine full-scale genetic variants of NTN1 for NSCL/P in Chinese Han people. Initially, targeted sequencing of NTN1 gene was performed on 159 NSCL/P patients to identify susceptible single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with NSCL/P. Then, association analysis and burden analysis were separately used to validate the common variants and rare variants identified among large size of samples (1608 NSCL/P cases and 2255 controls). Additionally, NSCL/P subtype association analysis was applied to elucidate the etiology discrepancy of non-syndromic cleft lip with palate (NSCLP) and non-syndromic cleft lip only (NSCLO). Lastly, bioinformatics analysis was performed to annotate and prioritize candidate variants. We found 15 NSCL/P-associated SNPs including rs4791774 (P = 1.10E-08, OR = 1.467, 95% CI: 1.286~1.673) and rs9788972 (P = 1.28E-07, OR = 1.398, 95% CI : 1.235~1.584) originally detected by previous GWASs in Chinese Han ancestry. Four NSCLO risk-associated SNPs and eight specific NSCLP associated SNPs were found. Three SNPs (rs4791331, rs4791774 and rs9900753) were predicted to locate at regulatory region of NTN1. Our study validated the association between NTN1 gene and pathogenesis of NSCL/P and reinforced the hypothesis that NSCLP have a different etiology from NSCLO.

To implement a successful breeding program in carcass production, a comprehensive understanding of genetic characteristics and relationships between the traits is of paramount importance. In this study, genomic heritability and genomic correlation between carcass traits, including carcass weight (CW), rib eye area (REA), rib thickness (RT), subcutaneous fat thickness (SFT), yield rate (YI), and beef marbling score (BMS) were estimated using the genomic data of 9,850 Japanese Black cattle (4,142 heifers and 5,708 steers). In addition, we investigated the effect of genetic relatedness degree on the estimation of genetic parameters of carcass traits in sub-populations created based on different GRM-cutoff values. Genome-based restricted maximum likelihood (GREML) analysis was applied to estimate genetic parameters. Using all animal data, the heritability values for carcass traits were estimated as moderate to relatively high magnitude, ranging from 0.338 to 0.509 with standard errors, ranging from 0.014 to 0.015. The genetic correlations were obtained low and negative between SFT and REA [-0.198 (0.034)] and between SFT and BMS [-0.096 (0.033)] traits, and high and negative between SFT and YI [-0.634 (0.022)]. REA trait was genetically highly correlated with YI and BMS [0.811 (0.012) and 0.625 (0.022), respectively]. In sub-populations created based on the genetic-relatedness ceiling, the heritability estimates ranged from 0.212 (0.131) to 0.647 (0.066). At the genetic-relatedness ceiling of 0.15, the correlation values between most traits with low genomic correlation were overestimated while the correlations between the traits with relatively moderate to high correlations, ranging from 0.380 to 0.811, were underestimated. The values were steady at the ceilings of 0.30-0.95 (sample size of 5,443-9,850) for most of the highly correlated traits. The results demonstrated that there is considerable genetic variation and also favorable genomic correlations between carcass traits. Therefore, the genetic improvement for the traits can be simultaneously attained through genomic selection. In addition, we observed that depending on the degree of relationship between individuals and sample size, the genomic heritability and correlation estimates for carcass traits may be different.Copyright © 2023 Rostamzadeh Mahdabi, Tian, Li, Wang, Zhao, Li, Yang, Zhang, Li and Esmailizadeh."
"36704342","A statistical boosting framework for polygenic risk scores based on large-scale genotype data.","Front Genet","Polygenic risk scores (PRS) evaluate the individual genetic liability to a certain trait and are expected to play an increasingly important role in clinical risk stratification. Most often, PRS are estimated based on summary statistics of univariate effects derived from genome-wide association studies. To improve the predictive performance of PRS, it is desirable to fit multivariable models directly on the genetic data. Due to the large and high-dimensional data, a direct application of existing methods is often not feasible and new efficient algorithms are required to overcome the computational burden regarding efficiency and memory demands. We develop an adapted component-wiseL2-boosting algorithm to fit genotype data from large cohort studies to continuous outcomes using linear base-learners for the genetic variants. Similar to the snpnet approach implementing lasso regression, the proposed snpboost approach iteratively works on smaller batches of variants. By restricting the set of possible base-learners in each boosting step to variants most correlated with the residuals from previous iterations, the computational efficiency can be substantially increased without losing prediction accuracy. Furthermore, for large-scale data based on various traits from the UK Biobank we show that our method yields competitive prediction accuracy and computational efficiency compared to the snpnet approach and further commonly used methods. Due to the modular structure of boosting, our framework can be further extended to construct PRS for different outcome data and effect types-we illustrate this for the prediction of binary traits.Copyright © 2023 Klinkhammer, Staerk, Maj, Krawitz and Mayr."

This study aimed to establish a culture system that induces a robust number of primordial germ cell-like cells (PGCLCs) from common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) embryonic stem cells. The robust induction was achieved by not only activation of the conserved PGC-inducing signals, WNT and BMP4, but also temporal inhibitions of WNT and retinoic acid signals, which prevent mesodermal and neural differentiation, respectively, during PGCLC differentiation. Many of the gene expression and differentiation properties of common marmoset PGCLCs were similar to those of human PGCLCs, making this culture system a reliable and useful primate model. Finally, we identified PDPN and KIT as surface marker proteins by which PGCLCs can be isolated from embryonic stem cells without genetic manipulation. This study will expand the opportunities for research on germ cell development and production of functional gametes to the common marmoset.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Ovarian development requires the combination of germ cells and several types of somatic cells. Among these, granulosa cells play a key role in follicle formation and support for oogenesis. Whereas efficient protocols exist for generating human primordial germ cell-like cells (hPGCLCs) from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), a method of generating granulosa cells has been elusive. Here, we report that simultaneous overexpression of two transcription factors (TFs) can direct the differentiation of hiPSCs to granulosa-like cells. We elucidate the regulatory effects of several granulosa-related TFs and establish that overexpression of NR5A1 and either RUNX1 or RUNX2 is sufficient to generate granulosa-like cells. Our granulosa-like cells have transcriptomes similar to human fetal ovarian cells and recapitulate key ovarian phenotypes including follicle formation and steroidogenesis. When aggregated with hPGCLCs, our cells form ovary-like organoids (ovaroids) and support hPGCLC development from the premigratory to the gonadal stage as measured by induction of DAZL expression. This model system will provide unique opportunities for studying human ovarian biology and may enable the development of therapies for female reproductive health.© 2023, Pierson Smela, Kramme et al."
"36737434","Resetting histone modifications during human prenatal germline development.","Cell Discov","Histone modifications play critical roles in regulating gene expression and present dynamic changes during early embryo development. However, how they are reprogrammed during human prenatal germline development has not yet been elucidated. Here, we map the genome-wide profiles of three key histone modifications in human primordial germ cells (hPGCs) from weeks 8 to 23 of gestation for the first time by performing ULI-NChIP-seq. Notably, H3K4me3 exhibits a canonical promoter-enriched pattern, though with relatively lower enrichment, and is positively correlated with gene expression in globally hypomethylated hPGCs. In addition, H3K27me3 presents very low enrichment but plays an important role in not only dynamically governing specific bivalent promoters but also impeding complete X chromosome reactivation in female hPGCs. Given the activation effects of both global DNA demethylation and H3K4me3 signals, repressive H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 marks are jointly responsible for the paradoxical regulation of demethylation-resistant regions in hPGCs. Collectively, our results provide a unique roadmap of three core histone modifications during hPGC development, which helps to elucidate the architecture of germ cell reprogramming in an extremely hypomethylated DNA environment.© 2023.

"36719274","Efficient generation of marmoset primordial germ cell-like cells using induced pluripotent stem cells.","Elife","Reconstitution of germ cell fate from pluripotent stem cells provides an opportunity to understand the molecular underpinnings of germ cell development. Here, we established robust methods for induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) culture in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus[cj]), allowing stable propagation in an undifferentiated state. Notably, iPSCs cultured on a feeder layer in the presence of a WNT signaling inhibitor upregulated genes related to ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic processes and enter a permissive state that enables differentiation into primordial germ cell-like cells (PGCLCs) bearing immunophenotypic and transcriptomic similarities to pre-migratory cjPGCs in vivo. Induction of cjPGCLCs is accompanied by transient upregulation of mesodermal genes, culminating in the establishment of a primate-specific germline transcriptional network. Moreover, cjPGCLCs can be expanded in monolayer while retaining the germline state. Upon co-culture with mouse testicular somatic cells, these cells acquire an early prospermatogonia-like phenotype. Our findings provide a framework for understanding and reconstituting marmoset germ cell development in vitro, thus providing a comparative tool and foundation for a preclinical modeling of human in vitro gametogenesis.© 2023, Seita, Cheng et al."
"36652508","Epigenetic resetting in the human germ line entails histone modification remodeling.","Sci Adv","Epigenetic resetting in the mammalian germ line entails acute DNA demethylation, which lays the foundation for gametogenesis, totipotency, and embryonic development. We characterize the epigenome of hypomethylated human primordial germ cells (hPGCs) to reveal mechanisms preventing the widespread derepression of genes and transposable elements (TEs). Along with the loss of DNA methylation, we show that hPGCs exhibit a profound reduction of repressive histone modifications resulting in diminished heterochromatic signatures at most genes and TEs and the acquisition of a neutral or paused epigenetic state without transcriptional activation. Efficient maintenance of a heterochromatic state is limited to a subset of genomic loci, such as evolutionarily young TEs and some developmental genes, which require H3K9me3 and H3K27me3, respectively, for efficient transcriptional repression. Accordingly, transcriptional repression in hPGCs presents an exemplary balanced system relying on local maintenance of heterochromatic features and a lack of inductive cues."

However, whereas most genes in lamina-associated domains (LADs) are inactive, over ten percent reside in local euchromatic contexts and are expressed. How these genes are regulated and whether they are able to interact with regulatory elements remain unclear. Here, we integrate publicly available enhancer-capture Hi-C data with our own chromatin state and transcriptomic datasets to show that inferred enhancers of active genes in LADs are able to form connections with other enhancers within LADs and outside LADs. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses show proximity changes between differentially expressed genes in LADs and distant enhancers upon the induction of adipogenic differentiation. We also provide evidence of involvement of lamin A/C, but not lamin B1, in repressing genes at the border of an in-LAD active region within a topological domain. Our data favor a model where the spatial topology of chromatin at the nuclear lamina is compatible with gene expression in this dynamic nuclear compartment."

Despite much progress over the past decade, the genome-wide annotation of lncRNAs remains incomplete and many known non-coding loci are still poorly characterized. Here, we report the discovery of a previously unannotated lncRNA that is transcribed 230 kb upstream of theSOX17gene and located within the same topologically associating domain. We termed itT-REX17(TranscriptRegulatingEndoderm and activated by soX17) and show that it is induced following SOX17 activation but its expression is more tightly restricted to early definitive endoderm. Loss ofT-REX17affects crucial functions independent of SOX17 and leads to an aberrant endodermal transcriptome, signaling pathway deregulation and epithelial to mesenchymal transition defects. Consequently, cells lacking the lncRNA cannot further differentiate into more mature endodermal cell types. Taken together, our study identified and characterizedT-REX17as a transiently expressed and essential non-coding regulator in early human endoderm differentiation.© 2023, Landshammer, Bolondi et al."
"36755284","Resilient phenotypes among bereaved youth: a comparison of trajectory, relative, and cross-domain approaches.","Child Adolesc Psychiatry Ment Health","Bereavement is a common traumatic event associated with adverse health outcomes across the life course. Despite these risks, not all bereaved individuals experience these negative effects. Limited scientific consensus exists on how to define resilience in individuals who have experienced the death of a loved one.Using a sample of N = 3766 youth from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children birth cohort, we identified bereavement of a family member between ages 7 and 8.5. We derived and compared three different approaches to assess resilience among bereaved youth. Trajectory-based psychological resilience identified sub-groups with similar psychological symptom profiles between ages 6 and 16 using latent growth mixture models. Relative psychological resilience at age 16 leveraged standardized residuals from a model regressing psychological symptoms on bereavement to determine better-than-expected psychological functioning relative to bereavement status. Relative cross-domain resilience around age 16 was a sum score of the residuals approach applied to eight unique domains of health. Predictive validity of each approach was assessed using depressive symptoms at age 17.5 RESULTS: Overall, N = 877 (23%) youth were bereaved of a family member between ages 7 and 8.5. Using latent growth mixture models, a three-class solution described 84% of bereaved youth with low and stable psychological symptoms over time, 8% with worsening symptoms, and 8% with improving yet elevated symptoms. Each relative resilience score was largely concordant with the trajectory-based approach in identifying individuals as resilient or not, though relative psychological resilience demonstrated a stronger degree of concordance than the cross-domain score. Relative psychological and cross-domain resilience exhibited moderate to low correlation, depending on the domains included (r = 0.14-0.43). For each approach, resilience significantly predicted lower depressive symptoms at age 17.5, highlighting predictive validity of these measures.Psychological symptom trajectories among bereaved youth aligned with those previously identified among bereaved adults. The residual-based approach to defining resilience exhibited limited utility in the context of bereavement. When identifying risk and resilience after bereavement, researchers and clinicians must address the interplay across psychosocial and physical health domains, as bereaved youth considered resilient from a mental health perspective may benefit from intervention in other domains.© 2023.

However, these studies frequently do not consider parent-of-origin differences, such as genomic imprinting, which result in monoallelic expression. In addition, genome-wide allele-specific chromatin conformation associations have not been extensively explored. There are few accessible bioinformatic workflows for investigating allelic conformation differences and these require pre-phased haplotypes which are not widely available.We developed a bioinformatic pipeline, ""HiCFlow,"" that performs haplotype assembly and visualization of parental chromatin architecture. We benchmarked the pipeline using prototype haplotype phased Hi-C data from GM12878 cells at three disease-associated imprinted gene clusters. Using Region Capture Hi-C and Hi-C data from human cell lines (1-7HB2, IMR-90, and H1-hESCs), we can robustly identify the known stable allele-specific interactions at the IGF2-H19 locus. Other imprinted loci (DLK1 and SNRPN) are more variable and there is no ""canonical imprinted 3D structure,"" but we could detect allele-specific differences in A/B compartmentalization. Genome-wide, when topologically associating domains (TADs) are unbiasedly ranked according to their allele-specific contact frequencies, a set of allele-specific TADs could be defined. These occur in genomic regions of high sequence variation. In addition to imprinted genes, allele-specific TADs are also enriched for allele-specific expressed genes. We find loci that have not previously been identified as allele-specific expressed genes such as the bitter taste receptors (TAS2Rs).This study highlights the widespread differences in chromatin conformation between heterozygous loci and provides a new framework for understanding allele-specific expressed genes.© 2023.

Curcumin is a natural ingredient extracted fromCurcuma longawith anti-HCC activity, while the therapeutic mechanisms of curcumin remain unclear, especially on ferroptosis and cuproptosis.Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of curcumin treatment in PLC, KMCH, and Huh7 cells were identified, respectively. The common genes among them were then obtained to perform functional enrichment analysis and prognostic analysis. Moreover, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was carried out for the construction of the co-expression network. The ferroptosis potential index (FPI) and the cuproptosis potential index (CPI) were subsequently used to quantitatively analyze the levels of ferroptosis and cuproptosis. Finally, single-cell transcriptome analysis of liver cancer was conducted.We first identified 702, 515, and 721 DEGs from curcumin-treated PLC, KMCH, and Huh7 cells, respectively. Among them,HMOX1,CYP1A1,HMGCS2,LCN2, andMTTPmay play an essential role in metal ion homeostasis. By WGCNA, grey60 co-expression module was associated with curcumin treatment and involved in the regulation of ion homeostasis. Furthermore, FPI and CPI assessment showed that curcumin had cell-specific effects on ferroptosis and cuproptosis in different HCC cells. In addition, there are also significant differences in ferroptosis and cuproptosis levels among 16 HCC cell subtypes according to single-cell transcriptome data analysis.We developed CPI and combined it with FPI to quantitatively analyze curcumin-treated HCC cells. It was found that ferroptosis and cuproptosis, two known metal ion-mediated forms of programmed cell death, may have a vital effect in treating HCC with curcumin, and there are significant differences in various liver cancer cell types and curcumin treatment which should be considered in the clinical application of curcumin."

Addressing these limitations, we develop the Heterogeneous Integrated Graph for Predicting Disease Genes (HetIG-PreDiG) model that includes gene-gene, gene-disease, and gene-tissue associations. We predict novel disease genes using low-dimensional representation of nodes accounting for network structure, and extending beyond network structure using the developed Gene-Disease Prioritization Score (GDPS) reflecting the degree of gene-disease association via gene co-expression data. For negative training samples, we select non-associated gene and disease nodes with lower GDPS that are less likely to be affiliated. We evaluate the developed model's success in predicting novel disease genes by analyzing the prediction probabilities of gene-disease associations. HetIG-PreDiG successfully predicts (Micro-F1 = 0.95) gene-disease associations, outperforming baseline models, and is validated using published literature, thus advancing our understanding of complex genetic diseases.Copyright: © 2023 Jagodnik et al.

Construction of cell-type-specific FGNs enables the understanding of cell-type-specific functional gene relationships and insights into genetic mechanisms of human diseases in disease-relevant cell types. However, most existing FGNs were developed without consideration of specific cell types within tissues.In this study, we created a multimodal deep learning model (MDLCN) to predict cell-type-specific FGNs in the human brain by integrating single-nuclei gene expression data with global protein interaction networks. We systematically evaluated the prediction performance of the MDLCN and showed its superior performance compared to two baseline models (boosting tree and convolutional neural network). Based on the predicted cell-type-specific FGNs, we observed that cell-type marker genes had a higher level of hubness than non-marker genes in their corresponding cell type. Furthermore, we showed that risk genes underlying autism and Alzheimer's disease were more strongly connected in disease-relevant cell types, supporting the cellular context of predicted cell-type-specific FGNs.Our study proposes a powerful deep learning approach (MDLCN) to predict FGNs underlying a diverse set of cell types in human brain. The MDLCN model enhances prediction accuracy of cell-type-specific FGNs compared to single modality convolutional neural network (CNN) and boosting tree models, as shown by higher areas under both receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and precision-recall curves for different levels of independent test datasets. The predicted FGNs also show evidence for the cellular context and distinct topological features (i.e. higher hubness and topological score) of cell-type marker genes. Moreover, we observed stronger modularity among disease-associated risk genes in FGNs of disease-relevant cell types. For example, the strength of connectivity among autism risk genes was stronger in neurons, but risk genes underlying Alzheimer's disease were more connected in microglia.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36726786","Specific gene module pair-based target identification and drug discovery.","Front Pharmacol","Identification of the biological targets of a compound is of paramount importance for the exploration of the mechanism of action of drugs and for the development of novel drugs. A concept of the Connectivity Map (CMap) was previously proposed to connect genes, drugs, and disease states based on the common gene-expression signatures. For a new query compound, the CMap-based method can infer its potential targets by searching similar drugs with known targets (reference drugs) and measuring the similarities into their specific transcriptional responses between the query compound and those reference drugs. However, the available methods are often inefficient due to the requirement of the reference drugs as a medium to link the query agent and targets. Here, we developed a general procedure to extract target-induced consensus gene modules from the transcriptional profiles induced by the treatment of perturbagens of a target. A specific transcriptional gene module pair (GMP) was automatically identified for each target and could be used as a direct target signature. Based on the GMPs, we built the target network and identified some target gene clusters with similar biological mechanisms. Moreover, a gene module pair-based target identification (GMPTI) approach was proposed to predict novel compound-target interactions. Using this method, we have discovered novel inhibitors for three PI3K pathway proteins PI3Kα/β/δ, including PU-H71, alvespimycin, reversine, astemizole, raloxifene HCl, and tamoxifen.Copyright © 2023 Li, Bai, Zhan, Zhang, Zhang, Zhang, Wang and Zhao."

However, while many networks, including functional gene interaction networks, are dense, weighted graphs, node2vec is fundamentally limited in its ability to use edge weights during the biased random walk generation process, thus under-using all the information in the network.Here, we present node2vec+, a natural extension of node2vec that accounts for edge weights when calculating walk biases and reduces to node2vec in the cases of unweighted graphs or unbiased walks. Using two synthetic datasets, we empirically show that node2vec+ is more robust to additive noise than node2vec in weighted graphs. Then, using genome-scale functional gene networks to solve a wide range of gene function and disease prediction tasks, we demonstrate the superior performance of node2vec+ over node2vec in the case of weighted graphs.

Research efforts have so far been directed to improving GWAS techniques rather than on making the results of GWAS interoperable with other genomic signals; this is currently hindered by the use of heterogeneous formats and uncoordinated experiment descriptions.To practically facilitate integrative use, we propose to include GWAS datasets within the META-BASE repository, exploiting an integration pipeline previously studied for other genomic datasets that includes several heterogeneous data types in the same format, queryable from the same systems. We represent GWAS SNPs and metadata by means of the Genomic Data Model and include metadata within a relational representation by extending the Genomic Conceptual Model with a dedicated view. To further reduce the gap with the descriptions of other signals in the repository of genomic datasets, we perform a semantic annotation of phenotypic traits. Our pipeline is demonstrated using two important data sources, initially organized according to different data models: the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog and FinnGen (University of Helsinki). The integration effort finally allows us to use these datasets within multi-sample processing queries that respond to important biological questions. These are then made usable for multi-omic studies together with, e.g., somatic and reference mutation data, genomic annotations, epigenetic signals.As a result of the our work on GWAS datasets, we enable 1) their interoperable use with several other homogenized and processed genomic datasets in the context of the META-BASE repository; 2) their big data processing by means of the GenoMetric Query Language and associated system.

We sequenced 63 whole genomes from 21 ID probands and their unaffected parents. In addition, we analysed 30 previously sequenced genomes from exome-negative ID probands. We found that regulatory DNMs were selectively enriched in fetal brain-specific enhancers as compared with adult brain enhancers. DNM-containing enhancers were associated with genes that show preferential expression in the prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, we identified recurrently mutated enhancer clusters that regulate genes involved in nervous system development (CSMD1,OLFM1, andPOU3F3). Most of the DNMs from ID probands showed allele-specific enhancer activity when tested using luciferase assay. Using CRISPR-mediated mutation and editing of epigenomic marks, we show that DNMs at regulatory elements affect the expression of putative target genes. Our results, therefore, provide new evidence to indicate that DNMs in fetal brain-specific enhancers play an essential role in the aetiology of ID.© 2023 De Vas et al."

The mechanisms underlying the impacts of lifestyle interventions on inflammation remain to be fully explained; however, epigenetic modifications may be critical. The purpose of our study was to investigate the impacts of eccentric resistance exercise and fatty acid supplementation on DNA methylation and mRNA expression ofTNFandIL6in skeletal muscle and leukocytes. Eight non-resistance exercise-trained males completed three bouts of isokinetic eccentric contractions of the knee extensors. The first bout occurred at baseline, the second occurred following a three-week supplementation of either omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid or extra virgin olive oil and the final bout occurred after eight-weeks of eccentric resistance training and supplementation. Acute exercise decreased skeletal muscleTNFDNA methylation by 5% (p= 0.031), whereasIL6DNA methylation increased by 3% (p= 0.01). Leukocyte DNA methylation was unchanged following exercise (p> 0.05); however, three hours post-exercise theTNFDNA methylation decreased by 2% (p= 0.004). In skeletal muscle, increasedTNFandIL6mRNA expression levels were identified immediately post-exercise (p< 0.027); however, the leukocyte mRNA expression was unchanged. Associations between DNA methylation and markers of exercise performance, inflammation and muscle damage were identified (p< 0.05). Acute eccentric resistance exercise is sufficient to induce tissue-specific DNA methylation modifications toTNFandIL6; however, neither eccentric training nor supplementation was sufficient to further modify the DNA methylation."

However, apart from poised enhancers that are observed in early stages of development and putative silencers, the functional significance of cis-regulatory elements lacking H3K27ac is poorly understood. Here we show that macroH2A histone variants mark a subset of enhancers in normal and cancer cells, which we coined 'macro-Bound Enhancers', that modulate enhancer activity. We find macroH2A variants localized at enhancer elements that are devoid of H3K27ac in a cell type-specific manner, indicating a role for macroH2A at inactive enhancers to maintain cell identity. In following, reactivation of macro-bound enhancers is associated with oncogenic programs in breast cancer and their repressive role is correlated with the activity of macroH2A2 as a negative regulator of BRD4 chromatin occupancy. Finally, through single cell epigenomic profiling of normal mammary stem cells derived from mice, we show that macroH2A deficiency facilitates increased activity of transcription factors associated with stem cell activity.© 2023.

Despite the abundant prior studies of integrating cancer multi-omics data, none of them organizes these associations in a hierarchical structure and validates the discoveries in extensive external data. We infer this Integrated Hierarchical Association Structure (IHAS) from the complete data of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and compile a compendium of cancer multi-omics associations. Intriguingly, diverse alterations on genomes/epigenomes from multiple cancer types impact transcriptions of 18 Gene Groups. Half of them are further reduced to three Meta Gene Groups enriched with (1) immune and inflammatory responses, (2) embryonic development and neurogenesis, (3) cell cycle process and DNA repair. Over 80% of the clinical/molecular phenotypes reported in TCGA are aligned with the combinatorial expressions of Meta Gene Groups, Gene Groups, and other IHAS subunits. Furthermore, IHAS derived from TCGA is validated in more than 300 external datasets including multi-omics measurements and cellular responses upon drug treatments and gene perturbations in tumors, cancer cell lines, and normal tissues. To sum up, IHAS stratifies patients in terms of molecular signatures of its subunits, selects targeted genes or drugs for precision cancer therapy, and demonstrates that associations between survival times and transcriptional biomarkers may vary with cancer types. These rich information is critical for diagnosis and treatments of cancers.Copyright: © 2022 Tiong et al.

"36809439","Multivariate GWAS analysis reveals loci associated with liver functions in continental African populations.","PLoS One","Liver disease is any condition that causes liver damage and inflammation and may likely affect the function of the liver. Vital biochemical screening tools that can be used to evaluate the health of the liver and help diagnose, prevent, monitor, and control the development of liver disease are known as liver function tests (LFT). LFTs are performed to estimate the level of liver biomarkers in the blood. Several factors are associated with differences in concentration levels of LFTs in individuals, such as genetic and environmental factors. The aim of our study was to identify genetic loci associated with liver biomarker levels with a shared genetic basis in continental Africans, using a multivariate genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach.We used two distinct African populations, the Ugandan Genome Resource (UGR = 6,407) and South African Zulu cohort (SZC = 2,598). The six LFTs used in our analysis were: aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), total bilirubin, and albumin. A multivariate GWAS of LFTs was conducted using the exact linear mixed model (mvLMM) approach implemented in GEMMA and the resulting P-values were presented in Manhattan and quantile-quantile (QQ) plots. First, we attempted to replicate the findings of the UGR cohort in SZC. Secondly, given that the genetic architecture of UGR is different from that of SZC, we further undertook similar analysis in the SZC and discussed the results separately.A total of 59 SNPs reached genome-wide significance (P = 5x10-8) in the UGR cohort and with 13 SNPs successfully replicated in SZC. These included a novel lead SNP near the RHPN1 locus (lead SNP rs374279268, P-value = 4.79x10-9, Effect Allele Frequency (EAF) = 0.989) and a lead SNP at the RGS11 locus (lead SNP rs148110594, P-value = 2.34x10-8, EAF = 0.928). 17 SNPs were significant in the SZC, while all the SNPs fall within a signal on chromosome 2, rs1976391 mapped to UGT1A was identified as the lead SNP within this region.Using multivariate GWAS method improves the power to detect novel genotype-phenotype associations for liver functions not found with the standard univariate GWAS in the same dataset.Copyright: © 2023 Soremekun et al.

Using human and macaque embryonic neocortical H3K27ac data coupled with a deep learning model of enhancers, we identified ~4000 enhancer gains in humans, which, per our model, can often be attributed to single-nucleotide essential mutations. Our analyses suggest that functional gains in embryonic brain development are associated with de novo enhancers whose putative target genes exhibit increased expression in progenitor cells and interneurons and partake in critical neural developmental processes. Essential mutations alter enhancer activity through altered binding of key transcription factors (TFs) of embryonic neocortex, including ISL1, POU3F2, PITX1/2, and several SOX TFs, and are associated with central nervous system disorders. Overall, our results suggest that essential mutations lead to gain of embryonic neocortex enhancers, which orchestrate expression of genes involved in critical developmental processes associated with human cognition."

With the advent of improved optimization algorithms, faster GPU speeds, and more intricate machine learning libraries, hybrid convolutional and recurrent neural network architectures can be constructed and applied to extract crucial information from non-coding DNA.Using a comparative analysis of the performance of thousands of Deep Learning (DL) architectures, we developed ChromDL, a neural network architecture combining bidirectional gated recurrent units (BiGRU), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and bidirectional long short-term memory units (BiLSTM), which significantly improves upon a range of prediction metrics compared to its predecessors in transcription factor binding site (TFBS), histone modification (HM), and DNase-I hypersensitive site (DHS) detection. Combined with a secondary model, it can be utilized for accurate classification of gene regulatory elements. The model can also detect weak transcription factor (TF) binding with higher accuracy as compared to previously developed methods and has the potential to accurately delineate TF binding motif specificities.The ChromDL source code can be found at https://github.com/chrishil1/ChromDL ."

Unfortunately, this is often reliant on invasive and/or less sensitive methods that do not provide deep phenotype assessments of disease state to guide treatment. This paper examined plasma cell-free DNA chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (cfChIP-seq) to define molecular gene sets in physiological and heart transplant patients taking immunosuppression medications. We show cfChIP-seq reliably detect gene signals that correlate with gene expression. In healthy controls and in heart transplant patients, cfChIP-seq reliably detected housekeeping genes. cfChIP-seq identified differential gene signals of the relevant immune and non-immune molecular pathways that were predominantly downregulated in immunosuppressed heart transplant patients compared to healthy controls. cfChIP-seq also identified tissue sources of cfDNA, detecting greater cell-free DNA from cardiac, hematopoietic, and other non-hematopoietic tissues such as the pulmonary, digestive, and neurological tissues in transplant patients than healthy controls. cfChIP-seq gene signals were reproducible between patient populations and blood collection methods. cfChIP-seq may therefore be a reliable approach to provide dynamic assessments of molecular pathways and tissue injury associated to disease."
"36788968","Designing Studies for Epigenetic Biomarker Development in Autoimmune Rheumatic Diseases.","Rheumatol Immunol Res","In just a few years, the number of epigenetic studies in autoimmune rheumatic and inflammatory diseases has greatly increased. This is in part due to the need of identifying additional determinants to genetics to explain the pathogenesis and development of these disorders. In this regard, epigenetics provides potential mechanisms that determine gene function, are linked to environmental factors, and could explain a wide range of phenotypic variability among patients with these diseases. Despite the high interest and number of studies describing epigenetic alterations under these conditions and exploring their relationship to various clinical aspects, few of the proposed biomarkers have yet reached clinical practice. The potential of epigenetic markers is high, as these alterations link measurable features with a number of biological traits. In the present article, we present published studies in the field, discuss some frequent limitations in the existing research, and propose a number of considerations that should be taken into account by those starting new projects in the field, with an aim to generate biomarkers that could make it into the clinics.© 2022 Carlos de la Calle-Fabregat et al., published by Sciendo."

Capturing active transcription initiation from cis-regulatory elements such as enhancers and promoters by capped small RNA sequencing (csRNA-seq), in contrast to capturing steady-state transcripts by conventional RNA-seq, allows unbiased identification of the underlying transcription factor activity and regulatory pathways. Here, we profile transcription initiation in critically ill COVID-19 patients, identifying transcription factor motifs that correlate with clinical lung injury and disease severity. Unbiased clustering reveals distinct subsets of cis-regulatory elements that delineate the cell type, pathway-specific, and combinatorial transcription factor activity. We find evidence of critical roles of regulatory networks, showing that STAT/BCL6 and E2F/MYB regulatory programs from myeloid cell populations are activated in patients with poor disease outcomes and associated with COVID-19 susceptibility genetic variants. More broadly, we demonstrate how capturing acute, disease-mediated changes in transcription initiation can provide insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms and stratify patient disease severity.Published by Elsevier Inc."
"36744920","PALM: a powerful and adaptive latent model for prioritizing risk variants with functional annotations.","Bioinformatics","The findings from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have greatly helped us to understand the genetic basis of human complex traits and diseases. Despite the tremendous progress, much effects are still needed to address several major challenges arising in GWAS. First, most GWAS hits are located in the non-coding region of human genome, and thus their biological functions largely remain unknown. Second, due to the polygenicity of human complex traits and diseases, many genetic risk variants with weak or moderate effects have not been identified yet.To address the above challenges, we propose a powerful and adaptive latent model (PALM) to integrate cell-type/tissue-specific functional annotations with GWAS summary statistics. Unlike existing methods, which are mainly based on linear models, PALM leverages a tree ensemble to adaptively characterize non-linear relationship between functional annotations and the association status of genetic variants. To make PALM scalable to millions of variants and hundreds of functional annotations, we develop a functional gradient-based expectation-maximization algorithm, to fit the tree-based non-linear model in a stable manner. Through comprehensive simulation studies, we show that PALM not only controls false discovery rate well, but also improves statistical power of identifying risk variants. We also apply PALM to integrate summary statistics of 30 GWASs with 127 cell type/tissue-specific functional annotations. The results indicate that PALM can identify more risk variants as well as rank the importance of functional annotations, yielding better interpretation of GWAS results.The source code is available at https://github.com/YangLabHKUST/PALM.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.© The Author(s) 2023.

"36742369","A cis-regulatory lexicon of DNA motif combinations mediating cell-type-specific gene regulation.","Cell Genom","Gene expression is controlled by transcription factors (TFs) that bind cognate DNA motif sequences incis-regulatory elements (CREs). The combinations of DNA motifs acting within homeostasis and disease, however, are unclear. Gene expression, chromatin accessibility, TF footprinting, and H3K27ac-dependent DNA looping data were generated and a random-forest-based model was applied to identify 7,531 cell-type-specificcis-regulatory modules (CRMs) across 15 diploid human cell types. A co-enrichment framework within CRMs nominated 838 cell-type-specific, recurrent heterotypic DNA motif combinations (DMCs), which were functionally validated using massively parallel reporter assays. Cancer cells engaged DMCs linked to neoplasia-enabling processes operative in normal cells while also activating new DMCs only seen in the neoplastic state. This integrative approach identifies cell-type-specificcis-regulatory combinatorial DNA motifs in diverse normal and diseased human cells and represents a general framework for decipheringcis-regulatory sequence logic in gene regulation."
"36707993","TIVAN-indel: a computational framework for annotating and predicting non-coding regulatory small insertions and deletions.","Bioinformatics","Small insertion and deletion (sindel) of human genome has an important implication for human disease. One important mechanism for non-coding sindel (nc-sindel) to have an impact on human diseases and phenotypes is through the regulation of gene expression. Nevertheless, current sequencing experiments may lack statistical power and resolution to pinpoint the functional sindel due to lower minor allele frequency or small effect size. As an alternative strategy, a supervised machine learning method can identify the otherwise masked functional sindels by predicting their regulatory potential directly. However, computational methods for annotating and predicting the regulatory sindels, especially in the non-coding regions, are underdeveloped.By leveraging labeled nc-sindels identified by cis-expression quantitative trait loci analyses across 44 tissues in Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), and a compilation of both generic functional annotations and large-scale epigenomic profiles, we develop TIssue-specific Variant Annotation for Non-coding indel (TIVAN-indel), which is a supervised computational framework for predicting non-coding regulatory sindels. As a result, we demonstrate that TIVAN-indel achieves the best prediction performance in both with-tissue prediction and cross-tissue prediction. As an independent evaluation, we train TIVAN-indel from the 'Whole Blood' tissue in GTEx and test the model using 15 immune cell types from an independent study named Database of Immune Cell Expression. Lastly, we perform an enrichment analysis for both true and predicted sindels in key regulatory regions such as chromatin interactions, open chromatin regions and histone modification sites, and find biologically meaningful enrichment patterns.https://github.com/lichen-lab/TIVAN-indel.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.© The Author(s) 2023.

They include diverse proteins that share functional domains and assemble into related multi-subunit complexes. To investigate functional relationships among these regulators, here we apply combinatorial CRISPR knockouts (KOs) to test over 35,000 gene-gene pairings in leukemia cells, using a library of over 300,000 constructs. Top pairs that demonstrate either compensatory non-lethal interactions or synergistic lethality enrich for paralogs and targets that occupy the same protein complex. The screen highlights protein complex dependencies not apparent in single KO screens, for example MCM histone exchange, the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex, and HBO1 (KAT7) complex. We explore two approaches to NuRD complex inactivation. Paralog and non-paralog combinations of the KAT7 complex emerge as synergistic lethal and specifically nominate the ING5 PHD domain as a potential therapeutic target when paired with other KAT7 complex member losses. These findings highlight the power of combinatorial screening to provide mechanistic insight and identify therapeutic targets within redundant networks.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Here we show a genetic-driven approach defining two obesity profiles that convey highly concordant and discordant diabetogenic effects. We annotate and then compare association signals for these profiles across clinical and molecular phenotypic layers. Key differences are identified in a wide range of traits, including cardiovascular mortality, fat distribution, liver metabolism, blood pressure, specific lipid fractions and blood levels of proteins involved in extracellular matrix remodelling. We find marginal differences in abundance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes bacteria in the gut. Instrumental analyses reveal prominent causal roles for waist-to-hip ratio, blood pressure and cholesterol content of high-density lipoprotein particles in the development of diabetes in obesity. We prioritize 17 genes from the discordant signature that convey protection against type 2 diabetes in obesity, which may represent logical targets for precision medicine approaches.© 2023.

Sequencing depth is a key parameter in experimental design and quality control. However, due to variable sequencing depth requirements across experimental conditions, it can be challenging to determine optimal sequencing depth, particularly for projects involving multiple targets or cell types.We developed the peaksat R package to provide target read depth estimates for epigenomic experiments based on the analysis of peak saturation curves. We applied peaksat to establish the distinctive read depth requirements for ChIP-seq studies of histone modifications in different cell lines. Using peaksat, we were able to estimate the target read depth required per library to obtain high-quality peak calls for downstream analysis. In addition, peaksat was applied to other sequence-enrichment methods including CUT&RUN and ATAC-seq.peaksat addresses a need for researchers to make informed decisions about whether their sequencing data has been generated to an adequate depth and subsequently sufficient meaningful peaks, and failing that, how many more reads would be required per library. peaksat is applicable to other sequence-based methods that include calling peaks in their analysis.© 2023.

However, the epigenetic events and molecular mechanisms occurring between consecutive cell divisions have been insufficiently studied due to technical limitations. Here, using the FUCCI reporter we developed a cell-cycle synchronised human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) differentiation system for uncovering epigenome and transcriptome dynamics during the first two divisions leading to definitive endoderm. We observed that transcription of key differentiation markers occurs before cell division, while chromatin accessibility analyses revealed the early inhibition of alternative cell fates. We found that Activator protein-1 members controlled by p38/MAPK signalling are necessary for inducing endoderm while blocking cell fate shifting toward mesoderm, and that enhancers are rapidly established and decommissioned between different cell divisions. Our study has practical biomedical utility for producing hPSC-derived patient-specific cell types since p38/MAPK induction increased the differentiation efficiency of insulin-producing pancreatic beta-cells.© 2023.

In this study, a bioinformatics analysis suggested that Passer (PS) transposons, which are members of the pogo superfamily, show signs of recent and current activity in animals and may be active in some species. Cell-based transposition assays revealed that the native PS transposases from Gasterosteus aculeatus and Danio rerio displayed very high activity in human cells relative to the Sleeping Beauty transposon. A typical overproduction inhibition phenomenon was observed for PS, and transposition capacity was decreased by ∼12% with each kilobase increase in the insertion size. Furthermore, PS exhibited a pronounced integration preference for genes and their transcriptional regulatory regions. We further show that two domesticated human proteins derived from PS transposases have lost their transposition activity.

Colocalization of miRNA-eQTLs with GWAS summary statistics yielded one robust colocalization of miR-4707-3p expression with educational attainment and brain size phenotypes, where the miRNA expression increasing allele was associated with decreased brain size. Exogenous expression of miR-4707-3p in primary human neural progenitor cells decreased expression of predicted targets and increased cell proliferation, indicating miR-4707-3p modulates progenitor gene regulation and cell fate decisions.

Obese women show lower levels of gonadotropin hormones, reduced fecundity, higher miscarriage rates and poorer outcomes ofin vitrofertilization, revealing that obesity affects female reproduction. In addition, adipose tissue contains special immune cells and obesity-induced inflammation is a chronic, low-grade inflammatory response.

"36672765","Predictors of Smoking in Older Adults and an Epigenetic Validation of Self-Report.","Genes (Basel)","There are several established predictors of smoking, but it is unknown if these predictors operate similarly for young and old smokers. We examined clinical data from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) to determine the predictive ability of gender, body mass index (BMI), marital status, and race on smoking behavior, with emphasis on gender interactions. In addition, we validated the self-report of smoking behaviors for a subgroup that had available epigenetic data in the form of cg05575921 methylation. Participants were N=9572 current or former smokers from the NLST biofluids database, age 55-74, minimum of 30 pack years, and mostly White. A subgroup of N=3084 who had DNA were used for the self-report validation analysis. The predictor analysis was based on the larger group and used penalized logistic regression to predict the self-report of being a former or current smoker at baseline. Cg05575921 methylation showed a moderate ability to discriminate among former and current smokers, AUC = 0.85 (95% confidence interval = [0.83, 0.86]). The final selected variables for the prediction model were BMI, gender, BMI by gender, age, divorced (vs. married), education, and race. The gender by BMI interaction was such that males had a higher probability of current smoking for lower BMI, but this switched to females having higher current smoking for overweight to obese. There is evidence that the self-reported smoking behavior in NLST is moderately accurate. The results of the primary analysis are consistent with the general smoking literature, and our results provide additional specificity regarding the gender by BMI interaction. Body weight issues might play a role in smoking cessation for older established smokers in a similar manner as younger smokers. It could be that women have less success with cessation when their BMI increases."

In this study, we investigated blood methylation levels and clinical characteristics of RA in a Chinese population.A total of 235 patients with RA, 30 with osteoarthritis (OA), and 30 matched healthy controls were recruited. The methylation status of seven CpGs in the differentially methylated region of HIPK3 (cg05501357) was measured using targeted methylation-sequencing technology. The association between methylation haplotypes and the overall methylation status of HIPK3 with clinical characteristics was assessed using generalized linear regression.All seven CpGs showed hypomethylation status in RA blood compared with OA and normal individuals (overall p= 1.143×10-8and FDR= 2.799×10-7), which is consistent with the previously reported high expression of HIPK3 in RA immune cells. Among all seven CpGs, 33286785 showed the highest predictive power with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.829; we received a higher AUC=0.864 when we combined HIPK3 with anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA -) and rheumatoid factor (RF +) in the prediction model, indicating that when a patient's ACPA is negative, HIPK3 can assist RF as a new clinical index for the diagnosis of RA. We also found that HIPK3 methylation levels were negatively correlated with C-reactive protein (CRP; r= -0.16, p= 0.01).

This study aimed to evaluate the role ofCCT2in Alzheimer's disease. First, bioinformatics database analysis revealed thatCCT2was significantly downregulated in patients with Alzheimer's disease and associated with autophagic clearance of β-amyloid. The 789 differentially expressed genes overlapped in AD-group andCCT2-low/high group, and theCCT2-high-associated genes screened by Pearson coefficients were enriched in protein folding, autophagy, and messenger RNA stability regulation pathways. These results suggest thatCCT2is significantly and positively associated with multiple pathways linked to autophagy and negatively associated with neuronal death. The logistic prediction model with 13 key genes, such asCCT2, screened in this study better predicts Alzheimer's disease occurrence (AUC = 0.9671) and is a favorable candidate for predicting potential biological targets of Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, this study predicts reciprocal micro RNAs and small molecule drugs for hub genes.

"36769009","DNA Methylation of Î±-Synuclein Intron 1 Is Significantly Decreased in the Frontal Cortex of Parkinson's Individuals with GBA1 Mutations.","Int J Mol Sci","Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common movement disorder, estimated to affect 4% of individuals by the age of 80. Mutations in the glucocerebrosidase 1 (GBA1) gene represent the most common genetic risk factor for PD, with at least 7-10% of non-Ashkenazi PD individuals carrying aGBA1mutation (PD-GBA1). Although similar to idiopathic PD, the clinical presentation of PD-GBA1includes a slightly younger age of onset, a higher incidence of neuropsychiatric symptoms, and a tendency to earlier, more prevalent and more significant cognitive impairment. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying PD-GBA1are incompletely understood, but, as in idiopathic PD, α-synuclein accumulation is thought to play a key role. It has been hypothesized that this overexpression of α-synuclein is caused by epigenetic modifications. In this paper, we analyze DNA methylation levels at 17 CpG sites located within intron 1 and the promoter of the α-synuclein (SNCA) gene in three different brain regions (frontal cortex, putamen and substantia nigra) in idiopathic PD, PD-GBA1and elderly non-PD controls. In all three brain regions we find a tendency towards a decrease in DNA methylation within an eight CpG region of intron 1 in both idiopathic PD and PD-GBA1. The trend towards a reduction in DNA methylation was more pronounced in PD-GBA1, with a significant decrease in the frontal cortex. This suggests that PD-GBA1and idiopathic PD have distinct epigenetic profiles, and highlights the importance of separating idiopathic PD and PD-GBA1cases. This work also provides initial evidence that different genetic subtypes might exist within PD, each characterized by its own pathological mechanism. This may have important implications for how PD is diagnosed and treated."

"36832370","Links between Childhood Obesity, High-Fat Diet, and Central Precocious Puberty.","Children (Basel)","In recent years, the existing relationship between excess overweight and central precocious puberty (CPP) has been reported, especially in girls. Different nutritional choices have been associated with different patterns of puberty. In particular, the involvement of altered biochemical and neuroendocrine pathways and a proinflammatory status has been described in connection with a high-fat diet (HFD). In this narrative review, we present an overview on the relationship between obesity and precocious pubertal development, focusing on the role of HFDs as a contributor to activating the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis. Although evidence is scarce and studies limited, especially in the paediatric field, the harm of HFDs on PP is a relevant problem that cannot be ignored. Increased knowledge about HFD effects will be useful in developing strategies preventing precocious puberty in children with obesity. Promoting HFD-avoiding behavior may be useful in preserving children's physiological development and protecting reproductive health. Controlling HFDs may represent a target for policy action to improve global health."

The adverse effect of As exposure on the kidneys of people living in As endemic areas have not been extensively studied. Furthermore, the impact of only prenatal exposure to As on the progression of CKD also has not been fully characterized. In the present study, we examined the effect of prenatal exposure to low doses of As 0.04 and 0.4 mg/kg body weight (0.04 and 0.4 ppm, respectively) on the progression of CKD in male offspring using a Wistar rat model. Interestingly, only prenatal As exposure was sufficient to elevate the expression of profibrotic (TGF-β1) and proinflammatory (IL-1α, MIP-2α, RANTES, and TNF-α) cytokines at 2-day, 12- and 38-week time points in the exposed progeny. Further, alteration in adipogenic factors (ghrelin, leptin, and glucagon) was also observed in 12- and 38-week old male offspring prenatally exposed to As. An altered level of these factors coincides with impaired glucose metabolism and homeostasis accompanied by progressive kidney damage. We observed a significant increase in the deposition of extracellular matrix components and glomerular and tubular damage in the kidneys of 38-week-old male offspring prenatally exposed to As. Furthermore, the overexpression of TGF-β1 in kidneys corresponds with hypermethylation of the TGF-β1 gene-body, indicating a possible involvement of prenatal As exposure-driven epigenetic modulations of TGF-β1 expression. Our study provides evidence that prenatal As exposure to males can adversely affect the immunometabolism of offspring which can promote kidney damage later in life.Copyright © 2023 Singh, Tiwari, Sharma, Khan, Gangopadhyay, Singh, Koshta, Shukla, Arjaria, Mandrah, Jagdale, Patnaik, Roy, Singh, Giri and Srivastava."

The pathogenesis of psoriasis is related to the environment, genetics, epigenetics, and dysregulation of immune cells such as T cells, dendritic cells (DCs), and nonimmune cells such as keratinocytes. Absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2), a susceptibility gene locus for psoriasis, has been strongly linked to the genetic and epigenetic aspects of psoriasis and increased in expression in psoriatic keratinocytes. AIM2 was found to be activated in an inflammasome-dependent way to release IL-1β and IL-18 to mediate inflammation, and to participate in immune regulation in psoriasis, or in an inflammasome-independent way by regulating the function of regulatory T(Treg) cells or programming cell death in keratinocytes as well as controlling the proliferative state of different cells. AIM2 may also play a role in the recurrence of psoriasis by trained immunity. In this review, we will elaborate on the characteristics of AIM2 and how AIM2 mediates the development of psoriasis.Copyright © 2023 Zhang, Xu, Cheng and Zhou."

Here, we aimed to prospectively investigate the interactive effects of genetic variants-from a genome-wide approach-and early life stress (ELS) on child subcortical brain structures, and their association with subsequent mental health problems.Primary analyses were conducted using data from the Generation R Study (N= 2257), including genotype and cumulative prenatal and postnatal ELS scores (encompassing life events, contextual risk, parental risk, interpersonal risk, direct victimisation). Neuroimaging data were collected at age 10 years, including intracranial and subcortical brain volumes (accumbens, amygdala, caudate, hippocampus, pallidum, putamen, thalamus). Genome-wide association and genome-wide-by-environment interaction analyses (GWEIS, run separately for prenatal/postnatal ELS) were conducted for eight brain outcomes (i.e., 24 genome-wide analyses) in the Generation R Study (discovery). Polygenic scores (PGS) using the resulting weights were calculated in an independent (target) cohort (adolescent brain cognitive development Study;N= 10,751), to validate associations with corresponding subcortical volumes and examine links to later mother-reported internalising and externalising problems.One GWEIS-prenatal stress locus was associated with caudate volume (rs139505895, mapping ontoPRSS12andNDST3) and two GWEIS-postnatal stress loci with the accumbens (rs2397823 and rs3130008, mapping ontoCUTA, SYNGAP1,andTABP). Functional annotation revealed that these genes play a role in neuronal plasticity and synaptic function, and have been implicated in neuro-developmental phenotypes, for example, intellectual disability, autism, and schizophrenia. None of these associations survived a more stringent correction for multiple testing across all analysis sets. In the validation sample, all PGSgenotypewere associated with their respective brain volumes, but no PGSGxEassociated with any subcortical volume. None of the PGS associated with internalising or externalising problems.This study lends novel suggestive insights into gene-environment interplay on the developing brain as well as pointing to promising candidate loci for future replication and mechanistic studies."

Changes in DNA methylation affect T cell biological processes, which may explain the occurrence and progression of comorbidity. However, downstream regulatory pathways of DNA methylation in two diseases and the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated.The GSE50101, GSE72541, GSE50222 and OEP002482 were mined for the identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) or co-expressed genes and differentially methylated genes (DMGs) in AR and CSU patients. We applied GO analysis and consensus clustering to study the potential functions and signal pathways of selected genes in two diseases. GSVA and logistic regression analysis were used to find the regulatory pathway between DNA methylation and activation patterns of CD4+ T cells. Besides, we used the Illumina 850k chip to detect DNA methylation expression profiles and recognize the differentially methylated CpG positions (DMPs) on corresponding genes. Finally, we annotated the biological process of these genes using GO and KEGG pathway analysis.The AR-related DEGs were found closely related to the differentiation and activation of CD4+ T cells. The DEGs or co-expressed genes of CD4+ T cells in AR and CSU patients were also clustered using GO and KEGG analysis and we got 57 co-regulatory pathways. Furthermore, logistic regression analysis showed that the regulation of cellular component size was closely related to the activation of CD4+ T cells regulated by DNA methylation. We got self-tested data using the Illumina 850k chip and identified 98 CpGs that were differentially methylated in patients. Finally, we mapped the DMPs to 15 genes and found that they were mainly enriched in the same CD4+T cell regulating pathway.Our study indicated that DNA methylation affected by pollen participated in the activation patterns of CD4 + T cells, providing a novel direction for the symptomatic treatment of the co-occurrence of AR and CSU.Copyright © 2023 Yang, Wen, Chen, Kang, Xiang, Ding, Gao, Tong and Guo."

However, the events involved in this EV-mediated Aβ pathology are unclear. EV-proteomics studies identified Serpine-1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, PAI-1) as a major connecting ""hub"" on several protein-protein interaction maps. Serpine-1 was described as a key player in Aβ pathology and was linked to HIV-1 infection as well. Therefore, the aim of this work was to address the hypothesis that Serpine-1 can be transferred via EVs from brain endothelial cells to NPCs and contribute to NPC dysfunction. HBMEC concentrated and released Serpine-1 via EVs, the effect that was potentiated by HIV-1 and Aβ. EVs loaded with Serpine-1 were readily taken up by NPCs, and HIV-1 enhanced this event. Interestingly, a highly specific Serpine-1 inhibitor PAI039 increased EV-Aβ transfer to NPCs in the presence of HIV-1. PAI039 also partially blocked mitochondrial network morphology and mitochondrial function alterations in the recipient NPCs, which developed mainly after HIV + Aβ-EV transfer. PAI039 partly attenuated HIV-EV-mediated decreased synaptic protein levels in NPCs, while increased synaptic protein levels in NPC projections. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the complex mechanisms underlying EV-Serpine-1 related Aβ pathology in the context of HIV infection. They are relevant to HIV-1 associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) in an effort to elucidate the mechanisms of neuropathology in HIV infection."

This study aims to elucidate the trends in smoking-related prostate cancer from 1990 to 2019 using Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 study data.Data on prostate cancer attributable to smoking were extracted from Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2019. The numbers and age-standardized rates on smoking-related prostate cancer mortality (ASMR) and disability-adjusted life years (ASDR) were analyzed by year, age, region, country, and socio-demographic index (SDI) level. Estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) was calculated to evaluate the temporal trends of ASMR and ASDR from 1990 to 2019.Of all prostate cancer deaths and DALYs globally in 2019, 6% and 6.6% were attributable to smoking, which contributed to 29,298 (95% CI 12,789 to 46,609) deaths and 571,590 (95% CI 253,490 to 917,820) disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) in 2019. The number of smoking-related deaths and DALYs showed an upward trend, increasing by half from 1990 to 2019, while ASMR and ASDR declined in five sociodemographic indexes (SDI) regions, with the fastest decline in high SDI regions. For geographical regions, Western Europe and East Asia were the high-risk areas of prostate cancer deaths and DALYs attributable to smoking, among which China and the United States were the countries with the heaviest burden. The ASMR has decreased in all age groups, with the fastest decrease occurring in 75-79 years old. The ASMR or ASDR tended to increase in countries with the lowest SDI, but declined in countries with the highest SDI. The EAPC in ASMR or ASDR was highly negatively correlated with Human Development Index (HDI) in 2019, with coefficients 0.46.The number of smoking-related prostate cancer deaths and DALYs continued to increase globally, whereas its ASMR and ASDR have been decreasing. This substantial progress is particularly significant in developed regions and vary across geographic regions. Medical strategies to prevent and reduce the burden should be adjusted and implemented based on country-specific disease prevalence.© 2023. The Author(s)."

However, the promised mechanistic explanations have not quite settled yet. Here, we propose a theoretical and computational analysis framework to semi-automatically produce network models of the regulatory constraints influencing a biological function. This way, we identified functions significantly enriched on the analyzed omics and described associated features, for each of the four breast cancer molecular subtypes. For instance, we identified functions sustaining over-representation of invasion-related processes in the basal subtype and DNA modification processes in the normal tissue. We found limited overlap on the omics-associated functions between subtypes; however, a startling feature intersection within subtype functions also emerged. The examples presented highlight new, potentially regulatory features, with sound biological reasons to expect a connection with the functions. Multi-omic regulatory networks thus constitute reliable models of the way omics are connected, demonstrating a capability for systematic generation of mechanistic hypothesis.Copyright © 2023 Ochoa and Hernández-Lemus."

We aimed to illuminate the role of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor subfamily C (NLRC) in GBM.Based on public database data (mainly The Cancer Genome Atlas [TCGA]), we performed bioinformatics analysis to visually evaluate the role and mechanism of NLRCs in GBM. Then, we validated our findings in a glioma tissue microarray (TMA) by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and the prognostic value of NOD1 was assessed via random forest (RF) models.In GBM tissues, the expression of NLRC members was significantly increased, which was related to the low survival rate of GBM. Additionally, Cox regression analysis revealed that the expression of NOD1 (among NLRCs) served as an independent prognostic marker. A nomogram based on multivariate analysis proved the effective predictive performance of NOD1 in GBM. Enrichment analysis showed that high expression of NOD1 could regulate extracellular structure, cell adhesion, and immune response to promote tumor progression. Then, immune infiltration analysis showed that NOD1 overexpression correlated with an enhanced immune response. Then, in a glioma TMA, the results of IHC revealed that the increase in NOD1 expression indicated high recurrence and poor prognosis of human glioma. Furthermore, the expression level of NOD1 showed good prognostic value in the TMA cohort via RF.The value of NOD1 as a biomarker for GBM was demonstrated. The possible mechanisms may lie in the regulatory role of NLRC-related pathways in the tumor microenvironment.© 2023 Han et al."

In contrast, multi-omics approaches to studying health and disease permit the generation and integration of multiple data types on a much larger scale, offering a comprehensive picture of biological and disease processes. Gastroenterology and hepatobiliary research are particularly well-suited to such analyses, given the unique position of the luminal gastrointestinal (GI) tract at the nexus between the gut (mucosa and luminal contents), brain, immune and endocrine systems, and GI microbiome. The generation of 'big data' from multi-omic, multi-site studies can enhance investigations into the connections between these organ systems and organisms and more broadly and accurately appraise the effects of dietary, pharmacological, and other therapeutic interventions. In this review, we describe a variety of useful omics approaches and how they can be integrated to provide a holistic depiction of the human and microbial genetic and proteomic changes underlying physiological and pathophysiological phenomena.

Although C-Maf-inducing protein (Cmip) has been reported to be associated with NAFLD, its exact underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we aimed to elucidate this mechanism in NAFLD in vitro and in vivo. We first identified alterations in the methylation status of the Cmip intron 1 region in mouse liver tissues with high-fat high-sucrose diet-induced NAFLD. Knockdown of DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt) 1 significantly increased Cmip expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays of AML12 cells treated with oleic and palmitic acid (OPA) revealed that Dnmt1 was dissociated and that methylation of H3K27me3 was significantly decreased in the Cmip intron 1 region. Conversely, the knockdown of Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (Tet2) decreased Cmip expression. Following OPA treatment, the CCCTC-binding factor (Ctcf) was recruited, and H3K4me3 was significantly hypermethylated. Intravenous Cmip siRNA injection ameliorated NAFLD pathogenic features in ob/ob mice. Additionally, Pparγ and Cd36 expression levels were dramatically decreased in the livers of ob/ob mice administered siCmip, and RNA sequencing revealed that Gbp2 was involved. Gbp2 knockdown also induced a decrease in Pparγ and Cd36 expression, resulting in the abrogation of fatty acid uptake into cells. Our data demonstrate that Cmip and Gbp2 expression levels are enhanced in human liver tissues bearing NAFLD features. We also show that Dnmt1-Trt2/Ctcf-mediated reversible modulation of Cmip methylation regulates the Gbp2-Pparγ-Cd36 signaling pathway, indicating the potential of Cmip as a novel therapeutic target for NAFLD.© 2023.

This study aims to evaluate whether CT based sarcopenia could differentiate KIT/PDGFRA wild-type gastrointestinal stromal tumor (wt-GIST) from the mutant-type GIST (mu-GIST), and to evaluate genetic features of GIST. A total of 174 patients with GIST (wt-GIST = 52) were retrospectively identified between January 2011 to October 2019. A sarcopenia nomogram was constructed by multivariate logistic regression. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated by discrimination, calibration curve, and decision curve. Genomic data was obtained from our own specimens and also from the open databases cBioPortal. Data was analyzed by R version 3.6.1 and clusterProfiler ( http://cbioportal.org/msk-impact ). There were significantly higher incidence (75.0% vs. 48.4%) and more severe sarcopenia in patients with wt-GIST than in patients with mu-GIST. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that sarcopenia score (fitted based on age, gender and skeletal muscle index), and muscle fat index were independent predictors for higher risk of wt-GIST (P < 0.05 for both the training and validation cohorts). Our sarcopenia nomogram achieved a promising efficiency with an AUC of 0.879 for the training cohort, and 0.9099 for the validation cohort with a satisfying consistency in the calibration curve. Favorable clinical usefulness was observed using decision curve analysis. The additional gene sequencing analysis based on both our data and the external data demonstrated aberrant signal pathways being closely associated with sarcopenia in the wt-GIST. Our study supported the use of CT-based assessment of sarcopenia in differentiating the wt-GIST from the mu-GIST preoperatively.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36713248","Beyond the exome: what's next in diagnostic testing for Mendelian conditions.","ArXiv","Despite advances in clinical genetic testing, including the introduction of exome sequencing (ES), more than 50% of individuals with a suspected Mendelian condition lack a precise molecular diagnosis. Clinical evaluation is increasingly undertaken by specialists outside of clinical genetics, often occurring in a tiered fashion and typically ending after ES. The current diagnostic rate reflects multiple factors, including technical limitations, incomplete understanding of variant pathogenicity, missing genotype-phenotype associations, complex gene-environment interactions, and reporting differences between clinical labs. Maintaining a clear understanding of the rapidly evolving landscape of diagnostic tests beyond ES, and their limitations, presents a challenge for non-genetics professionals. Newer tests, such as short-read genome or RNA sequencing, can be challenging to order and emerging technologies, such as optical genome mapping and long-read DNA or RNA sequencing, are not available clinically. Furthermore, there is no clear guidance on the next best steps after inconclusive evaluation. Here, we review why a clinical genetic evaluation may be negative, discuss questions to be asked in this setting, and provide a framework for further investigation, including the advantages and disadvantages of new approaches that are nascent in the clinical sphere. We present a guide for the next best steps after inconclusive molecular testing based upon phenotype and prior evaluation, including when to consider referral to a consortium such as GREGoR, which is focused on elucidating the underlying cause of rare unsolved genetic disorders."

Although CRMs play critical roles in cardiac regeneration of neonatal mice, their roles are yet to be fully elucidated. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the dynamic changes of CRMs during cardiac ontogeny and analyze the phenotypic and functional properties of CRMs in the promotion of cardiac regeneration. During mouse cardiac ontogeny, four CRM subsets exist successively: CX3CR1+CCR2-Ly6C-MHCII-(MP1), CX3CR1lowCCR2lowLy6C-MHCII-(MP2), CX3CR1-CCR2+Ly6C+MHCII-(MP3), and CX3CR1+CCR2-Ly6C-MHCII+(MP4). MP1 cluster has different derivations (yolk sac, fetal liver, and bone marrow) and multiple functions population. Embryonic and neonatal-derived-MP1 directly promoted cardiomyocyte proliferation through Jagged-1-Notch1 axis and significantly ameliorated cardiac injury following myocardial infarction. MP2/3 subsets could survive throughout adulthood. MP4, the main population in adult mouse hearts, contributed to inflammation. During ontogeny, MP1 can convert into MP4 triggered by changes in the cellular redox state. These findings delineate the evolutionary dynamics of CRMs under physiological conditions and found direct evidence that embryonic and neonatal-derived CRMs regulate cardiomyocyte proliferation. Our findings also shed light on cardiac repair following injury.© 2022 Chinese Pharmaceutical Association and Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

The analysis of 5mC levels revealed two categories of patients; Group A who, during the follow-up, had increased 5mC levels, and Group B who had decreased 5mC levels. Patients with low Fe-, folate-, and vitamin B12- levels during the initial visit showed increased levels of 5mC after treatment when assessed during the follow-up. During the follow-up, 5mC levels in Group A patients increased after treatment for hypovitaminosis with the nutraceutical compounds Animon Complex and MineraXin Plus. 5mC levels were maintained during the follow-up in Group A patients treated for neurological disorders with the bioproducts AtreMorine and NeoBrainine. There was a positive correlation between 5mC levels and MMSE scores, and an inverse correlation between 5mC and ADAS-Cog scores. This expected correlation was observed in Group A patients only.

The dynamic epigenetic changes during oncogenic transformation are related to tumor heterogeneity, unlimited self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation. This stem cell-like state or the aberrant reprogramming of cancer stem cells is the major challenge in treatment and drug resistance. Given the reversible nature of epigenetic modifications, the ability to restore the cancer epigenome through the inhibition of the epigenetic modifiers is a promising therapy for cancer treatment, either as a monotherapy or in combination with other anticancer therapies, including immunotherapies.

"36839279","A Glimpse into Milestones of Insulin Resistance and an Updated Review of Its Management.","Nutrients","Insulin is the main metabolic regulator of fuel molecules in the diet, such as carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. It does so by facilitating glucose influx from the circulation into the liver, adipose tissue, and skeletal myocytes. The outcome of which is subjected to glycogenesis in skeletal muscle and lipogenesis in adipose tissue, as well as in the liver. Therefore, insulin has an anabolic action while, on the contrary, hypoinsulinemia promotes the reverse process. Protein breakdown in myocytes is also encountered during the late stages of diabetes mellitus. The balance of the blood glucose level in physiological conditions is maintained by virtue of the interactive functions of insulin and glucagon. In insulin resistance (IR), the balance is disturbed because glucose transporters (GLUTs) of cell membranes fail to respond to this peptide hormone, meaning that glucose molecules cannot be internalized into the cells, the consequence of which is hyperglycemia. To develop the full state of diabetes mellitus, IR should be associated with the impairment of insulin release from beta-cells of the pancreas. Periodic screening of individuals of high risk, such as those with obesity, hypercholesterolemia, and pregnant nulliparous women in antenatal control, is vital, as these are important checkpoints to detect cases of insulin resistance. This is pivotal as IR can be reversed, provided it is detected in its early stages, through healthy dietary habits, regular exercise, and the use of hypoglycemic agents. In this review, we discuss the pathophysiology, etiology, diagnosis, preventive methods, and management of IR in brief."
"36834583","Methyl Donor Micronutrients: A Potential Dietary Epigenetic Target in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Patients.","Int J Mol Sci","Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by an aberrant immune response and persistent inflammation. Its pathogenesis remains unknown; however, a complex interaction between environmental, genetic, and epigenetic factors has been suggested to cause disease onset. Several studies have demonstrated that epigenetic alterations, such as DNA hypomethylation, miRNA overexpression, and altered histone acetylation, may contribute to SLE onset and the disease's clinical manifestations. Epigenetic changes, especially methylation patterns, are modifiable and susceptible to environmental factors such as diet. It is well known that methyl donor nutrients, such as folate, methionine, choline, and some B vitamins, play a relevant role in DNA methylation by participating as methyl donors or coenzymes in one-carbon metabolism. Based on this knowledge, this critical literature review aimed to integrate the evidence in animal models and humans regarding the role of nutrients in epigenetic homeostasis and their impact on immune system regulation to suggest a potential epigenetic diet that could serve as adjuvant therapy in SLE."

"36824863","Gene body DNA hydroxymethylation restricts the magnitude of transcriptional changes during aging.","bioRxiv","DNA hydroxymethylation (5hmC) is the most abundant oxidative derivative of DNA methylation (5mC) and is typically enriched at enhancers and gene bodies of transcriptionally active and tissue-specific genes. Although aberrant genomic 5hmC has been implicated in many age-related diseases, the functional role of the modification in aging remains largely unknown. Here, we report that 5hmC is stably enriched in multiple aged organs. Using the liver and cerebellum as model organs, we show that 5hmC accumulates in gene bodies associated with tissue-specific function and thereby restricts the magnitude of gene expression changes during aging. Mechanistically, we found that 5hmC decreases binding affinity of splicing factors compared to unmodified cytosine and 5mC, and is correlated with age-related alternative splicing events, suggesting RNA splicing as a potential mediator of 5hmCâ€™s transcriptionally restrictive function. Furthermore, we show that various age-related contexts, such as prolonged quiescence and senescence, are partially responsible for driving the accumulation of 5hmC with age. We provide evidence that this age-related function is conserved in mouse and human tissues, and further show that the modification is altered by regimens known to modulate lifespan. Our findings reveal that 5hmC is a regulator of tissue-specific function and may play a role in regulating longevity."
"36704790",NA,NA,"Biological aging and particularly the deviations between biological and chronological age are better predictors of health than chronological age alone. However, the predictors of accelerated biological aging are not very well understood. The aim was to determine the role of birth outcomes, time of puberty onset, body mass index (BMI), and body fat in accelerated biological aging in the third decade of life.We have conducted a second follow-up of the Czech part of the European Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood (ELSPAC-CZ) prenatal birth cohort in young adulthood (52% male; age 28-30;n= 262) to determine the role of birth outcomes, pubertal timing, BMI, and body fat on biological aging. Birth outcomes included birth weight, length, and gestational age at birth. Pubertal timing was determined by the presence of secondary sexual characteristics at the age of 11 and the age of first menarche in women. Biological age was estimated using the Klemera-Doubal Method (KDM), which applies 9-biomarker algorithm including forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), systolic blood pressure, glycated hemoglobin, total cholesterol, C-reactive protein, creatinine, urea nitrogen, albumin, and alkaline phosphatase. Accelerated/decelerated aging was determined as the difference between biological and chronological age (BioAGE).The deviations between biological and chronological age in young adulthood ranged from -2.84 to 4.39 years. Accelerated biological aging was predicted by higher BMI [in both early (R2adj= 0.05) and late 20s (R2adj= 0.22)], subcutaneous (R2adj= 0.21) and visceral fat (R2adj= 0.25), puberty onset (ηp2= 0.07), birth length (R2adj= 0.03), and the increase of BMI over the 5-year period between the two follow-ups in young adulthood (R2adj= 0.09). Single hierarchical model revealed that shorter birth length, early puberty onset, and greater levels of visceral fat were the main predictors, together explaining 21% of variance in accelerated biological aging.Our findings provide comprehensive support of the Life History Theory, suggesting that early life adversity might trigger accelerated aging, which leads to earlier onset of puberty but decreasing fitness in adulthood, reflected by more visceral fat and higher BMI. Our findings also suggest that reduction of BMI in young adulthood slows down biological aging.Copyright © 2023 Jáni, Zacková, Piler, Andrýsková, Brázdil and Marečková."

However, we did not search for hyperglycemia loci across all chromosomes. In this study, we performed quantitative trait loci (QTLs) mapping of longitudinal phenotypes from crosses between NSY (hyperglycemic) and C3H (normoglycemic) mice. We identified four new QTLs for hyperglycemia, namely Nidd5nsy, Nidd6nsy, Nidd1c3h, and Nidd2c3h, on Chromosome 1, 4, 10, and 13, respectively. These QTLs were associated with hyperglycemia in young mice and had attenuated effects in older mice. Nidd5nsy and Nidd6nsy were hyperglycemic with NSY alleles, and Nidd1c3h and Nidd2c3h were hyperglycemic with C3H alleles. We further bred Nidd5nsy congenic mice and demonstrated that Nidd5nsy has a strong effect on hyperglycemia when young, accompanied by insulin resistance and visceral fat accumulation. These results showed that the effects of individual QTLs strengthened or weakened with age, and that the sum of the effects of QTLs captured the age-related deterioration of glucose tolerance in individuals. Our results support the importance of longitudinal phenotypes in the genetic analysis of polygenic traits and have implications for the genetic basis and pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes in humans.© 2023.

It was only in the last century that humankind finally began taking significant steps towards these goals by sending astronauts into space, landing on the moon, and building the International Space Station. However, space voyage is very challenging and dangerous, and astronauts are under constant space radiation and microgravity. It has been shown that astronauts are at a high risk of developing a broad range of diseases/disorders. Thus, it is critical to develop a rapid and effective assay to monitor astronauts' health in space. In this study, gene expression and correlation patterns were analyzed for 10 astronauts (8 male and 2 female) using the publicly available microarray dataset E-GEOD-74708. We identified 218 differentially expressed genes between In-flight and Pre-flight and noticed that space travel decreased genome regulation and gene correlations across the entire genome, as well as individual signaling pathways. Furthermore, we systematically developed a shortlist of 32 genes that could be used to monitor astronauts' health during space travel. Further studies, including microgravity experiments, are warranted to optimize and validate the proposed assay."

Recent studies have indicated that the aerospace special environment including microgravity and space radiation poses a significant risk to the health of astronauts, which involves multiple pathophysiological effects on the human body as well on tissues and organs. It has been an important research topic to study the molecular mechanism of body damage and further explore countermeasures against the physiological and pathological changes caused by the space environment. In this study, we used the rat model to study the biological effects of the tissue damage and related molecular pathway under either simulated microgravity or heavy ion radiation or combined stimulation. Our study disclosed that ureaplasma-sensitive amino oxidase (SSAO) upregulation is closely related to the systematic inflammatory response (IL-6, TNF-α) in rats under a simulated aerospace environment. In particular, the space environment leads to significant changes in the level of inflammatory genes in heart tissues, thus altering the expression and activity of SSAO and causing inflammatory responses. The detailed molecular mechanisms have been further validated in the genetic engineering cell line model. Overall, this work clearly shows the biological implication of SSAO upregulation in microgravity and radiation-mediated inflammatory response, providing a scientific basis or potential target for further in-depth investigation of the pathological damage and protection strategy under a space environment."

Multiple organ systems are affected by microgravity and radiation, including the cardiovascular system. Previous transcriptomic studies have sought to reveal the changes in gene expression after spaceflight. However, little is known about the impact of long-term spaceflight on the mouse heart in vivo. This study focuses on the transcriptomic changes in the hearts of female C57BL/6J mice flown on the International Space Station (ISS) for 30 days. RNA was isolated from the hearts of three flight and three comparable ground control mice and RNA sequencing was performed. Our analyses showed that 1147 transcripts were significantly regulated after spaceflight. The MAPK, PI3K-Akt, and GPCR signaling pathways were predicted to be activated. Transcripts related to cytoskeleton breakdown and organization were upregulated, but no significant change in the expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) components or oxidative stress pathway-associated transcripts occurred. Our results indicate an absence of cellular senescence, and a significant upregulation of transcripts associated with the cell cycle. Transcripts related to cellular maintenance and survival were most affected by spaceflight, suggesting that cardiovascular transcriptome initiates an adaptive response to long-term spaceflight."

Microgravity (µg) is one of the main stressors in space causing hyperglycaemia. However, the underlying molecular pathways and synergistic effects of µgand hyperglycaemia are not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the effects of high glucose on EA.hy926 endothelial cells in simulated µg(s-µg) using a 3D clinostat and static normogravity (1g) conditions. After 14 days of cell culture under s-µgand 1gconditions, we compared the expression of extracellular matrix (ECM), inflammation, glucose metabolism, and apoptosis-related genes and proteins through qPCR, immunofluorescence, and Western blot analyses, respectively. Apoptosis was evaluated via TUNEL staining. Gene interactions were examined via STRING analysis. Our results show that glucose concentrations had a weaker effect than altered gravity. µgdownregulated the ECM gene and protein expression and had a stronger influence on glucose metabolism than hyperglycaemia. Moreover, hyperglycaemia caused more pronounced changes in 3D cultures than in 2D cultures, including bigger and a greater number of spheroids, upregulation of NOX4 and the apoptotic proteins NF-κB and CASP3, and downregulation of fibronectin and transglutaminase-2.

The roles of YAP/TAZ serving as a potential bridge in connecting liver metabolism with microgravity were specifically summarized. Existing evidence indicated that YAP/TAZ target gene expressions were affected by mechanotransductive pathways and phase separation, reasonably speculating that microgravity might regulate YAP/TAZ activation by disrupting these pathways via cytoskeletal remodeling or nuclear deformation, or disturbing condensates formation via diffusion limit, and then breaking liver homeostasis."
"36741463",NA,NA,"Astronauts experience dramatic loss of muscle mass, decreased strength, and insulin resistance, despite performing daily intense physical exercise that would lead to muscle growth on Earth. Partially mimicking spaceflight, prolonged bed rest causes muscle atrophy, loss of force, and glucose intolerance. To unravel the underlying mechanisms, we employed highly sensitive single fiber proteomics to detail the molecular remodeling caused by unloading and inactivity during bed rest and changes of the muscle proteome of astronauts before and after a mission on the International Space Station. Muscle focal adhesions, involved in fiber-matrix interaction and insulin receptor stabilization, are prominently downregulated in both bed rest and spaceflight and restored upon reloading. Pathways of antioxidant response increased strongly in slow but not in fast muscle fibers. Unloading alone upregulated markers of neuromuscular damage and the pathway controlling EIF5A hypusination. These proteomic signatures of mechanical unloading in muscle fiber subtypes contribute to disentangle the effect of microgravity from the pleiotropic challenges of spaceflight.© The Author(s) 2022.

However, substantial inter-individual heterogeneity in multisystem response was apparent with changes from pre to postflight ranging from -30% to +5%. We estimated that up to 17% of astronauts would experience performance-limiting deconditioning if current exercise countermeasures were used on future spaceflight missions.

To protect astronaut health and performance on critical missions, there is first a need to understand the effects of deep space hazards, including ionizing radiation, confinement, and altered gravity. Previous studies of rodents exposed to a single such stressor document significant deficits, but our study is the first to investigate possible cumulative and synergistic impacts of simultaneous ionizing radiation, confinement, and altered gravity on behavior and cognition. Our cohort was divided between 6-month-old female and male mice in group, social isolation, or hindlimb unloading housing, exposed to 0 or 50 cGy of 5 ion simplified simulated galactic cosmic radiation (GCRsim). We report interactions and independent effects of GCRsim exposure and housing conditions on behavioral and cognitive performance. Exposure to GCRsim drove changes in immune cell populations in peripheral blood collected early after irradiation, while housing conditions drove changes in blood collected at a later point. Female mice were largely resilient to deficits observed in male mice. Finally, we used principal component analysis to represent total deficits as principal component scores, which were predicted by general linear models using GCR exposure, housing condition, and early blood biomarkers.© 2023.

HAA was defined as the per cent of imaged lung with attenuation of -600 to -250 Hounsfield units. We used linear mixed-effects models to examine associations ofMUC5Brisk allele (T) and telomere length with longitudinal changes in HAAs. Joint models were used to examine associations of longitudinal changes in HAAs with death and interstitial lung disease (ILD).TheMUC5Brisk allele (T) was associated with an absolute change in HAAs of 2.60% (95% CI 0.36% to 4.86%) per 10 years overall. This association was stronger among those with a telomere length below an age-adjusted percentile of 5% (p value for interaction=0.008). A 1% increase in HAAs per year was associated with 7% increase in mortality risk (rate ratio (RR)=1.07, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.12) for overall death and 34% increase in ILD (RR=1.34, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.50).

Fasting blood samples were collected for DNA and RNA extraction within 24 h of admission. Nine CpG dinucleotides were selected from the GSTA4 promoter region for DNA methylation pyrosequencing. mRNA expression of GSTA4 was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).In vitrocell experiments were conducted to verify the association between 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine induced DNA hypomethylation and GSTA4 mRNA expression.Results:The mean methylation level of GSTA4 was much lower in IA patients, especially in IA patients, especially in unruptured IA (UIA), than that in controls (IA vs. Control,p< .001; ruptured IA (RIA) vs. Control,p= .005; UIA vs. Control,p< .001). With sex stratification, we further found that the association between GSTA4 methylation and IA risk presented only in women (mean methylation level: IA vs. Control,p< .001; RIA vs. Control,p= .009; UIA vs. Control,p< .001). GSTA4 mRNA expression was significantly higher in the IA group than in the control group (p< .01) and negatively correlated with DNA methylation in all individuals (r = -.746,p< .001). DNA hypomethylation can increase GSTA4 mRNA expression in human primary artery smooth muscle cells. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that GSTA4 mean methylation (AUC = .80,p< .001) was a reliable predictor of women intracranial aneurysm, among which CpG 1 exhibited the best predictive value (AUC = .89,p< .001). In addition, GSTA4 expression levels could also predict the risk of IA in women (AUC = .87,p= .005).Conclusion:Decreased DNA methylation and increased mRNA expression of the GSTA4 gene are associated with the risk of IA in women.Copyright © 2023 Xu, Yu, Zhou, Wu, Deng, Wu, Wang, Gao, Nie, Zhou, Sun and Huang."

However, little is known about the utility of neonatal acoustic cry characteristics in the prediction of long-term outcomes of very preterm infants.To evaluate whether acoustic characteristics of infant cry at neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) discharge are associated with behavioral and developmental outcomes at age 2 years in infants born very preterm.Infants born less than 30 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) were enrolled from April 2014 through June 2016 as part of a multicenter (9 US university affiliated NICUs) cohort study and followed to adjusted age 2 years. Reported analyses began on September 2021. Data were analyzed from September 2021 to September 2022.The primary exposure was premature birth (<30 weeks PMA).Cries were recorded during a neurobehavioral examination administered during the week of NICU discharge. Cry episodes were analyzed using a previously published computerized system to characterize cry acoustics. Year-2 outcomes included the Bayley-III Composite scores, Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT R/F), dichotomized using clinically significant cutoffs (<85 on Bayley Language, Cognitive and/or Motor Composite scores, T-score >63 on the CBCL Internalizing, Externalizing and/or Total Problem Scales and total M-CHAT R/F score >2).Analyzed infants (363 participants) were primarily male (202 participants [55.65%]) and had a mean [SD] gestational age of 27.08 [1.95] weeks). Cross-validated random forest models revealed that cry acoustics were associated with 2-year outcomes. Tests of diagnostic odds ratios (DOR) revealed that infants who exhibited total problem behavior CBCL scores greater than 63 at age 2 years were 3.3 times more likely (95% CI, 1.44-7.49) to be identified as so by random forest model estimates relative to other infants (scores ≤63); this association was robust to adjustment for family-wise type-I error rates and covariate measures. Similar associations were observed for internalizing (DOR, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.04-5.47) and externalizing (DOR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.12-4.54) scores on the CBCL, clinically significant language (DOR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.10-2.67) and cognitive (DOR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.00-2.88) scores on the Bayley-III, and a positive autism screen on the M-CHAT (DOR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.05-3.44).In this cohort study of preterm infants, findings pointed to the potential use of acoustic cry characteristics in the early identification of risk for long-term developmental and behavioral deficits."

Suicide attempts (SA) are greatly elevated in BD and are associated with decreased lifespan, biological aging, and poorer clinical outcomes. We investigated the relationship between GrimAge, an epigenetic clock trained on time-to-death and associated with mortality and lifespan, and SA in two independent cohorts of BD individuals (discovery cohort - controls (n = 50), BD individuals with (n = 77, BD/SA) and without (n = 67, BD/non-SA) lifetime history of SA; replication cohort - BD/SA (n = 48) and BD/non-SA (n = 47)). An acceleration index for the GrimAge clock (GrimAgeAccel) was computed from blood DNA methylation (DNAm) and compared between groups with multiple general linear models. Differences in epigenetic aging from the discovery cohort were validated in the independent replication cohort. In the discovery cohort, controls, BD/non-SA, and BD/SA significantly differed on GrimAgeAccel (F = 5.424, p = 0.005), with the highest GrimAgeAccel in BD/SA (p = 0.004, BD/SA vs. controls). Within the BD individuals, BD/non-SA and BD/SA differed on GrimAgeAccel in both cohorts (p = 0.008) after covariate adjustment. Finally, DNAm-based surrogates revealed possible involvement of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, leptin, and smoking pack-years in driving accelerated epigenetic aging. These findings pair with existing evidence that not only BD, but also SA, may be associated with an accelerated biological aging and provide putative biological mechanisms for morbidity and premature mortality in this population.© 2023.

The inclusion criteria were human studies; original research; direct placental variables; neuropsychological outcomes; and analysis between their associations. The exclusion criterion was the offspring's age-0-28 days or >19 years. The MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were last searched in May 2022. We utilized the ROBINS-I for the risk of bias assessment and performed a narrative synthesis. In total, 3252 studies were identified, out of which 16 were included (i.e., a total of 15,862 participants). Half of the studies were performed on children with neonatal complications, and 75% of the studies reported an association between a placental change and an outcome; however, following the completion of the funnel plots, a risk of publication bias was indicated. The largest study described a small association between placental size and a risk of psychiatric symptoms in boys only. Inconsistency between the studies limited the evidence in this review. In general, no strong evidence was found for an association between pathological placental changes and childhood neuropsychological outcomes after the neonatal period. However, the association between placental size and mental health in boys indicates a placental sexual dimorphism, thereby suggesting an increased vulnerability for male fetuses."

The understanding of their role in normal and pathological pregnancy is only just emerging. It has been established that clock genes are expressed in the placenta of animals and humans, but the rhythmicity of placenta immune cells is not known. Macrophages from healthy placenta of women at term were isolated and the expression of clock genes BMAL1, CLOCK, PER2, CRY2, and NR1D1 was assessed by qRT-PCR every 4 h over 24 h. Raw data were treated with cosinor analysis to evaluate the significance of the oscillations. Placental macrophages exhibited significant circadian expression of clock genes but one third of placental macrophages lost clock gene rhythmicity; the clock gene oscillations were restored by co-culture with trophoblasts. We wondered if melatonin, a key hormone regulating circadian rhythm, was involved in the oscillations of placental cells. We showed that macrophages and trophoblasts produced melatonin and expressed MT2 receptor. In women who developed preeclampsia during pregnancy, circadian oscillations of placental macrophages were lost and could not be rescued by coculture with trophoblasts from healthy women. Moreover, production and oscillations of melatonin were altered in preeclamptic macrophages. For the first time to our knowledge, this study shows circadian rhythms and melatonin production by placental macrophages. It also shows that preeclampsia is associated with a disruption of the circadian rhythm of placental cells.

In this framework, theomicssciences (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) and their combined use represent innovative approaches for the exploration of the complexity and heterogeneity of multiple sclerosis (MS). This review examines the evidence currently available on the application of omics sciences to MS, analyses the methods, their limitations, the samples used, and their characteristics, with a particular focus on biomarkers associated with the disease state, exposure to disease-modifying treatments (DMTs), and drug efficacies and safety profiles.Copyright © 2023 Lorena, Maristella, Federica, Giuseppe, Luigi and Eleonora."
"36788293","Origins and immunopathogenesis of autoimmune central nervous system disorders.","Nat Rev Neurol","The field of autoimmune neurology is rapidly evolving, and recent discoveries have advanced our understanding of disease aetiologies. In this article, we review the key pathogenic mechanisms underlying the development of CNS autoimmunity. First, we review non-modifiable risk factors, such as age, sex and ethnicity, as well as genetic factors such as monogenic variants, common variants in vulnerability genes and emerging HLA associations. Second, we highlight how interactions between environmental factors and epigenetics can modify disease onset and severity. Third, we review possible disease mechanisms underlying triggers that are associated with the loss of immune tolerance with consequent recognition of self-antigens; these triggers include infections, tumours and immune-checkpoint inhibitor therapies. Fourth, we outline how advances in our understanding of the anatomy of lymphatic drainage and neuroimmune interfaces are challenging long-held notions of CNS immune privilege, with direct relevance to CNS autoimmunity, and how disruption of B cell and T cell tolerance and the passage of immune cells between the peripheral and intrathecal compartments have key roles in initiating disease activity. Last, we consider novel therapeutic approaches based on our knowledge of the immunopathogenesis of autoimmune CNS disorders.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."
"36879264","Controlling the confounding effect of metabolic gene expression to identify actual metabolite targets in microsatellite instability cancers.","Hum Genomics","The metabolome is the best representation of cancer phenotypes. Gene expression can be considered a confounding covariate affecting metabolite levels. Data integration across metabolomics and genomics to establish the biological relevance of cancer metabolism is challenging. This study aimed to eliminate the confounding effect of metabolic gene expression to reflect actual metabolite levels in microsatellite instability (MSI) cancers.In this study, we propose a new strategy using covariate-adjusted tensor classification in high dimensions (CATCH) models to integrate metabolite and metabolic gene expression data to classify MSI and microsatellite stability (MSS) cancers. We used datasets from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) phase II project and treated metabolomic data as tensor predictors and data on gene expression of metabolic enzymes as confounding covariates.The CATCH model performed well, with high accuracy (0.82), sensitivity (0.66), specificity (0.88), precision (0.65), and F1 score (0.65). Seven metabolite features adjusted for metabolic gene expression, namely, 3-phosphoglycerate, 6-phosphogluconate, cholesterol ester, lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE), phosphatidylcholine, reduced glutathione, and sarcosine, were found in MSI cancers. Only one metabolite, Hippurate, was present in MSS cancers. The gene expression of phosphofructokinase 1 (PFKP), which is involved in the glycolytic pathway, was related to 3-phosphoglycerate. ALDH4A1 and GPT2 were associated with sarcosine. LPE was associated with the expression of CHPT1, which is involved in lipid metabolism. The glycolysis, nucleotide, glutamate, and lipid metabolic pathways were enriched in MSI cancers.We propose an effective CATCH model for predicting MSI cancer status. By controlling the confounding effect of metabolic gene expression, we identified cancer metabolic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. In addition, we provided the possible biology and genetics of MSI cancer metabolism.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36864125","Targeting TACC3 represents a novel vulnerability in highly aggressive breast cancers with centrosome amplification.","Cell Death Differ","Centrosome amplification (CA) is a hallmark of cancer that is strongly associated with highly aggressive disease and worse clinical outcome. Clustering extra centrosomes is a major coping mechanism required for faithful mitosis of cancer cells with CA that would otherwise undergo mitotic catastrophe and cell death. However, its underlying molecular mechanisms have not been fully described. Furthermore, little is known about the processes and players triggering aggressiveness of cells with CA beyond mitosis. Here, we identified Transforming Acidic Coiled-Coil Containing Protein 3 (TACC3) to be overexpressed in tumors with CA, and its high expression is associated with dramatically worse clinical outcome. We demonstrated, for the first time, that TACC3 forms distinct functional interactomes regulating different processes in mitosis and interphase to ensure proliferation and survival of cancer cells with CA. Mitotic TACC3 interacts with the Kinesin Family Member C1 (KIFC1) to cluster extra centrosomes for mitotic progression, and inhibition of this interaction leads to mitotic cell death via multipolar spindle formation. Interphase TACC3 interacts with the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex (HDAC2 and MBD2) in nucleus to inhibit the expression of key tumor suppressors (e.g., p21, p16 and APAF1) driving G1/S progression, and its inhibition blocks these interactions and causes p53-independent G1 arrest and apoptosis. Notably, inducing CA by p53 loss/mutation increases the expression of TACC3 and KIFC1 via FOXM1 and renders cancer cells highly sensitive to TACC3 inhibition. Targeting TACC3 by guide RNAs or small molecule inhibitors strongly inhibits growth of organoids and breast cancer cell line- and patient-derived xenografts with CA by induction of multipolar spindles, mitotic and G1 arrest. Altogether, our results show that TACC3 is a multifunctional driver of highly aggressive breast tumors with CA and that targeting TACC3 is a promising approach to tackle this disease.© 2023.

"36861035","Investigating the suitability of in vitro cell lines as models for the major subtypes of epithelial ovarian cancer.","Front Cell Dev Biol","Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most fatal gynaecological malignancy, accounting for over 200,000 deaths worldwide per year. EOC is a highly heterogeneous disease, classified into five major histological subtypes-high-grade serous (HGSOC), clear cell (CCOC), endometrioid (ENOC), mucinous (MOC) and low-grade serous (LGSOC) ovarian carcinomas. Classification of EOCs is clinically beneficial, as the various subtypes respond differently to chemotherapy and have distinct prognoses. Cell lines are often used asin vitromodels for cancer, allowing researchers to explore pathophysiology in a relatively cheap and easy to manipulate system. However, most studies that make use of EOC cell lines fail to recognize the importance of subtype. Furthermore, the similarity of cell lines to their cognate primary tumors is often ignored. Identification of cell lines with high molecular similarity to primary tumors is needed in order to better guide pre-clinical EOC research and to improve development of targeted therapeutics and diagnostics for each distinctive subtype. This study aims to generate a reference dataset of cell lines representative of the major EOC subtypes. We found that non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) optimally clustered fifty-six cell lines into five groups, putatively corresponding to each of the five EOC subtypes. These clusters validated previous histological groupings, while also classifying other previously unannotated cell lines. We analysed the mutational and copy number landscapes of these lines to investigate whether they harboured the characteristic genomic alterations of each subtype. Finally we compared the gene expression profiles of cell lines with 93 primary tumor samples stratified by subtype, to identify lines with the highest molecular similarity to HGSOC, CCOC, ENOC, and MOC. In summary, we examined the molecular features of both EOC cell lines and primary tumors of multiple subtypes. We recommend a reference set of cell lines most suited to represent four different subtypes of EOC for bothin silicoandin vitrostudies. We also identify lines displaying poor overall molecular similarity to EOC tumors, which we argue should be avoided in pre-clinical studies. Ultimately, our work emphasizes the importance of choosing suitable cell line models to maximise clinical relevance of experiments.Copyright © 2023 McCabe, Zaheed, McDade and Dean."
"36860655","Landscape of Genetic Alterations Underlying Hallmark Signature Changes in Cancer Reveals TP53 Aneuploidy-driven Metabolic Reprogramming.","Cancer Res Commun","The hallmark signatures based on gene expression capture core cancer processes. Through a pan-cancer analysis, we describe the overview of hallmark signatures across tumor types/subtypes and reveal significant relationships between these signatures and genetic alterations.TP53mutation exerts diverse changes, including increased proliferation and glycolysis, which are closely mimicked by widespread copy-number alterations. Hallmark signature and copy-number clustering identify a cluster of squamous tumors and basal-like breast and bladder cancers with elevated proliferation signatures, frequentTP53mutation, and high aneuploidy. In these basal-like/squamousTP53-mutated tumors, a specific and consistent spectrum of copy-number alterations is preferentially selected prior to whole-genome duplication. WithinTrp53-null breast cancer mouse models, these copy-number alterations spontaneously occur and recapitulate the hallmark signature changes observed in the human condition. Together, our analysis reveals intertumor and intratumor heterogeneity of the hallmark signatures, uncovering an oncogenic program induced byTP53mutation and select aneuploidy events to drive a worsened prognosis.Our data demonstrate thatTP53mutation and a resultant selected pattern of aneuploidies cause an aggressive transcriptional program including upregulation of glycolysis signature with prognostic implications. Importantly, basal-like breast cancer demonstrates genetic and/or phenotypic changes closely related to squamous tumors including 5q deletion that reveal alterations that could offer therapeutic options across tumor types regardless of tissue of origin.© 2023 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research."
"36856811","Identification of a novel eighteen-gene signature of recurrent metastasis neuroblastoma.","J Mol Med (Berl)","Neuroblastoma is the most common malignant tumor in childhood, and metastases occur in more than 30% patients. Recurrent metastasis is the main cause of poor prognosis and high mortality in neuroblastoma. In this regard, there is still a lack of sufficient biomarkers and effective therapies. Therefore, we performed a multi-omics analysis of neuroblastoma patients from Therapeutically Applicable Research To Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET). With clinical relapse site information, tumor samples derived from the primary site were divided into recurrent metastasis and primary tumor groups. The initial gene signature was obtained by comparing RNA-Seq and copy number variation differences. Survival data was used to further filter prognosis-related genes. This 18-gene signature consists of three clusters: tumor suppression, cell proliferation, and immunity. A super enhancer is involved in the enhanced expression of NCAPG in cluster2 together with IRF3. Based on the gene signature expression in primary neuroblastoma, it is possible to predict tumor metastasis before it occurs. According to the anticancer drug dataset of Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC), vinorelbine and docetaxel were predicted to have high sensitivity against recurrent metastatic neuroblastoma. In conclusion, our study offers a novel metastasis biomarker and helps understand the mechanisms of tumor recurrent metastasis. KEY MESSAGES: We identified a novel eighteen-gene signature of recurrent metastasis neuroblastoma and build risk and classification models. We dissected the regulatory role of NCAPG in signatures. We found immune exhaustion and immunosuppression in recurrent metastasis neuroblastoma. Vinorelbine and docetaxel were predicted to have high sensitivity against recurrent metastatic neuroblastoma.© 2023.

Here, we discovered a 30-gene transcriptome signature ""KDS30"" that encodes a novel EGFR/ERBB2-driven signaling network and predicts mt KRAS, but not NRAS or HRAS, oncogene addiction. High KDS30 tumors from mt KRAS lung and pancreatic cancer patients are enriched in genes upregulated by EGFR, ERBB2, mt KRAS or MEK. EGFR/ERBB2 (neratinib) and MEK (cobimetinib) inhibitor combination inhibits tumor growth and prolongs mouse survival in high, but not low, KDS30 mt KRAS lung and pancreatic xenografts, and is synergistic only in high KDS30 mt KRAS patient-derived organoids. Furthermore, mt KRAS high KDS30 lung and pancreatic cancer patients live significantly shorter lives than those with low KDS30. Thus, KDS30 can identify lung and pancreatic cancer patients whose tumors are addicted to mt KRAS, and predicts EGFR/ERBB2 and MEK inhibitor combination response.© 2023 The Author(s)."

The survival time is not improved by standard treatment. Although immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, the current therapy targets for glioblastoma patients are not satisfied. We systematically analyzed the expression patterns, predictive values, and immunological characteristics of PTPN18 in glioblastoma. The independent datasets and functional experiments were employed to validate our findings. Our data showed that PTPN18 is potentially cancerogenic in glioblastoma with advanced grades and poor prognosis. High expression of PTPN18 correlated with CD8+T cell exhaustion and immune suppression in glioblastoma. In addition, PTPN18 facilitates glioblastoma progression by accelerating glioma cell prefiltration, colony formation, and tumor growth in mice. PTPN18 also promotes cell cycle progression and inhibits apoptosis. Our results illustrate the characterization of PTPN18 in glioblastoma and highlight the potential value as an immunotherapeutic target for glioblastoma treatment.Copyright © 2023 Tao Wang et al."
"36843983","A novel strategy for precise prognosis management and treatment option in colon adenocarcinoma with TP53 mutations.","Front Surg","TP53 is one of the most frequent mutated genes in colon cancer. Although colon cancer with TP53 mutations has a high risk of metastasis and worse prognosis generally, it showed high heterogeneity clinically.A total of 1,412 colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) samples were obtained from two RNA-seq cohorts and three microarray cohorts, including the TCGA-COAD (N = 408), the CPTAC-COAD (N = 106), GSE39582 (N = 541), GSE17536 (N = 171) and GSE41258 (N = 186). The LASSO-Cox method was used to establish the prognostic signature based on the expression data. The patients were divided into high-risk and low-risk groups based on the median risk score. The efficiency of the prognostic signature was validated in various cohorts, including TP53-mutant and TP53 wild-type. The exploration of potential therapeutic targets and agents was performed by using the expression data of TP53-mutant COAD cell lines obtained from the CCLE database and the corresponding drug sensitivity data obtained from the GDSC database.A 16-gene prognostic signature was established in TP53-mutant COAD. The high-risk group had significantly inferior survival time compared to the low-risk group in all TP53-mutant datasets, while the prognostic signature failed to classify the prognosis of COAD with TP53 wild-type properly. Besides, the risk score was the independent poor factor for the prognosis in TP53-mutant COAD and the nomogram based on the risk score was also shown good predictive efficiency in TP53-mutant COAD. Moreover, we identified SGPP1, RHOQ, and PDGFRB as potential targets for TP53-mutant COAD, and illuminated that the high-risk patients might benefit from IGFR-3801, Staurosporine, and Sabutoclax.A novel prognostic signature with great efficiency was established especially for COAD patients with TP53 mutations. Besides, we identified novel therapeutic targets and potential sensitive agents for TP53-mutant COAD with high risk. Our findings provided not only a new strategy for prognosis management but also new clues for drug application and precision treatment in COAD with TP53 mutations.© 2023 Niu, Liu and Cai."
"36831372","Pharmacological Inhibition of Membrane Signaling Mechanisms Reduces the Invasiveness of U87-MG and U251-MG Glioblastoma Cells In Vitro.","Cancers (Basel)","Impairing the motility of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells is a compelling goal for new approaches to manage this highly invasive and rapidly lethal human brain cancer. Work here characterized an array of pharmacological inhibitors of membrane ion and water channels, alone and in combination, as tools for restraining glioblastoma spread in human GBM cell lines U87-MG and U251-MG. Aquaporins, AMPA glutamate receptors, and ion channel classes (shown to be upregulated in human GBM at the transcript level and linked to mechanisms of motility in other cell types) were selected as pharmacological targets for analyses. Effective compounds reduced the transwell invasiveness of U87-MG and U251-MG glioblastoma cells by 20-80% as compared with controls, without cytotoxicity. The compounds and doses used were: AqB013 (14 μM); nifedipine (25 µM); amiloride (10 µM); apamin (10 µM); 4-aminopyridine (250 µM); and CNQX (6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione; 30 µM). Invasiveness was quantified in vitro across transwell filter chambers layered with extracellular matrix. Co-application of each of the ion channel agents with the water channel inhibitor AqB013 augmented the inhibition of invasion (20 to 50% greater than either agent alone). The motility impairment achieved by co-application of pharmacological agents differed between the GBM proneural-like subtype U87-MG and classical-like subtype U251-MG, showing patterns consistent with relative levels of target channel expression (Human Protein Atlas database). In addition, two compounds, xanthurenic acid and caelestine C (from the Davis Open Access Natural Product-based Library, Griffith University QLD), were discovered to block invasion at micromolar doses in both GBM lines (IC50values from 0.03 to 1 µM), without cytotoxicity, as measured by full mitochondrial activity under conditions matching those in transwell assays and by normal growth in spheroid assays. Mechanisms of action of these agents based on published work are likely to involve modulation of glutamatergic receptor signaling. Treating glioblastoma by the concurrent inhibition of multiple channel targets could be a powerful approach for slowing invasive cell spread without cytotoxic side effects, potentially enhancing the effectiveness of clinical interventions focused on eradicating primary tumors."
"36826593","Molecular phenotypic linkage between N(6)-methyladenosine methylation and tumor immune microenvironment in hepatocellular carcinoma.","J Cancer Res Clin Oncol","The crucial role of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation in anti-tumor immunity and immunotherapy has been broadly depicted. However, the molecular phenotypic linkages between m6A modification pattern and immunological ecosystem are expected to be disentangled in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), for immunotherapeutic unresponsiveness circumvention and combination with promising drug agents.Modification patterns of m6A methylation were qualitatively dissected according to the large-scale HCC samples profiling. We then determined the immune phenotypic linkages by systematically evaluating their tumor microenvironment composition, immune/stromal-relevant signature, immune checkpoints correlation, and prognostic value. Individual quantification of m6A methylation pattern was achieved by m6Ascore construction, intensified by longitudinal single-cell analysis of immunotherapy cohort and validated by the transcriptomic profiles of our in-hospital GDPH-HCC cohort. Candidate therapeutic agents were also screened out.Three distinct m6A methylation patterns were determined in high accordance with inflamed-, excluded-, and desert-immunophenotype. To be precise, Immune-inflamed high-m6Ascore group was characterized by activated immunity with favorable prognosis. Stromal activation and absence of immune cell infiltration were observed in low-m6Ascore phenotype, linked to impaired outcome. Patients with low-m6Ascore demonstrated diminished responses and clinical benefits for cohorts receiving immunotherapy. The above credible linkage between m6A methylation pattern and tumor immune microenvironment was robustly validated in our GDPH-HCC cohort. Single-cell dynamic change of m6A methylation level in exhausted CD8 T cell and fibroblast was depicted in immunotherapy cohort fore and art. Derived from m6A methylation pattern, seven potential frontline drug agents were recognized as promising choice for high-m6Ascore patients.Our work bridged the credible linkage between epigenetics and anti-tumor immunity in HCC, unraveling m6A modification pattern as immunological indicator and predictor for immunotherapy. Individualized m6Ascore facilitated strategic choices to maximize therapy-responsive possibility.© 2023.

In this system, the expression of long-non-coding RNA LINC00992 is decreased. LINC00992 might therefore contribute to tamoxifen adaption and associated gene expres-sion changes. Here, we investigated whether a modulation of LINC00992 modifies gene expression, proliferation, and migration.Up- and down-- regulation of LINC00992 was performed using plasmid vectors and siRNA. Gene expression was measuredvianCounter® and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Database analysis was performed using GEPIA2 and cBioportal. Furthermore, we performed scratch assays, colony-forming assays, and proliferation assays with MCF-7 and MCF-7-TAM-R after up-regulation of LINC00992.Up- and down-regulation of LINC00992 caused gene expression changes in 4 of the 42 tamoxifen-regulated genes tested. Especially ubiquitin D, single-minded homologue 1 (SIM1) carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5 and the G-protein coupled oestrogen receptor 1 were affected. In tamoxifen-adapted MCF-7-TAM-R cells, LINC00992 overexpression resulted in augmented viability and proliferation and enhanced migration. Database analyses revealed that luminal breast cancers have increased expression of LINC00992 compared to Her2-type/neu- or basal type. Furthermore, higher expression of LINC00992 was associated with poor prognosis in luminal-A carcinomas.Changes in the expression of tamoxifen-regulated genes could be induced by manipulating LINC00992's abundance, suggesting that it is at least partially involved in the establishment of the tamoxifen-induced gene expression pattern. LINC00992 may also serve as a prognostic biomarker and may indicate the development of tamoxifen resistance.Copyright © 2022 Termedia."
"36809237","Kinome inhibition states and multiomics data enable prediction of cell viability in diverse cancer types.","PLoS Comput Biol","Protein kinases play a vital role in a wide range of cellular processes, and compounds that inhibit kinase activity emerging as a primary focus for targeted therapy development, especially in cancer. Consequently, efforts to characterize the behavior of kinases in response to inhibitor treatment, as well as downstream cellular responses, have been performed at increasingly large scales. Previous work with smaller datasets have used baseline profiling of cell lines and limited kinome profiling data to attempt to predict small molecule effects on cell viability, but these efforts did not use multi-dose kinase profiles and achieved low accuracy with very limited external validation. This work focuses on two large-scale primary data types, kinase inhibitor profiles and gene expression, to predict the results of cell viability screening. We describe the process by which we combined these data sets, examined their properties in relation to cell viability and finally developed a set of computational models that achieve a reasonably high prediction accuracy (R2 of 0.78 and RMSE of 0.154). Using these models, we identified a set of kinases, several of which are understudied, that are strongly influential in the cell viability prediction models. In addition, we also tested to see if a wider range of multiomics data sets could improve the model results and found that proteomic kinase inhibitor profiles were the single most informative data type. Finally, we validated a small subset of the model predictions in several triple-negative and HER2 positive breast cancer cell lines demonstrating that the model performs well with compounds and cell lines that were not included in the training data set. Overall, this result demonstrates that generic knowledge of the kinome is predictive of very specific cell phenotypes, and has the potential to be integrated into targeted therapy development pipelines.Copyright: © 2023 Berginski et al.

Its expression profiles and correlation with disease progression in prostate cancers are unknown.Transcriptomic profiles of Jumanji domain-containing protein genes were assessed using multiple public expression datasets generated from RNA-seq and cDNA microarray assays. RIOX2 protein expression was assessed using an immunohistochemistry approach on a tissue section array from benign and malignant prostate tissues. Gene expression profiles were analyzed using the bioinformatics software R package. Western blot assay examined androgen stimulation on RIOX2 protein expression in LNCaP cells.Among 35 Jumanji domain-containing protein genes, 12 genes were significantly upregulated in prostate cancers compared to benign compartments. COX regression analysis identified that the ribosomal oxygenase 2 (RIOX2) gene was the only one significantly associated with disease-specific survival outcomes in prostate cancer patients. RIOX2 upregulation was confirmed at the protein levels using immunohistochemical assays on prostate cancer tissue sections. Meanwhile, RIOX2 upregulation was associated with clinicopathological features, including late-stage diseases, adverse Gleason scores, TP53 gene mutation, and disease-free status. In castration-resistant prostate cancers (CRPC), RIOX2 expression was positively correlated with AR signaling index but negatively correlated with the neuroendocrinal progression index. However, androgen treatment had no significant stimulatory effect on RIOX2 expression, indicating a parallel but not a causative effect of androgen signaling on RIOX2 gene expression. Further analysis discovered that RIOX2 expression was tightly correlated with its promoter hypomethylation and MYC gene expression, consistent with the notion that RIOX2 was a c-Myc target gene.The Jumanji domain-containing protein RIOX2 was significantly overexpressed in prostate cancer, possibly due to c-Myc upregulation. RIOX2 upregulation was identified as an independent prognostic factor for disease-specific survival.Copyright © 2023 He, Liu, Sun, Zhang and Li."

In contrast, elevated CD47 expression in cutaneous melanomas is associated with improved survival. Previous studies implicated protective functions of CD47 expressed by immune cells in the melanoma tumor microenvironment. RNA sequencing analysis of responses induced by CD3 and CD28 engagement on wild type and CD47-deficient Jurkat T lymphoblast cells identified additional regulators of T cell function that were also CD47-dependent in mouse CD8 T cells. MYCN mRNA expression was upregulated in CD47-deficient cells but downregulated in CD47-deficient cells following activation. CD47 also regulated alternative splicing that produces two N-MYC isoforms. The CD47 ligand thrombospondin-1 inhibited expression of these MYCN mRNA isoforms, as well as induction of the oncogenic decoy MYCN opposite strand (MYCNOS) RNA during T cell activation. Analysis of mRNA expression data for melanomas in The Cancer Genome Atlas identified a significant coexpression of MYCN with CD47 and known regulators of CD8 T cell function. Thrombospondin-1 inhibited the induction of TIGIT, CD40LG, and MCL1 mRNAs following T cell activation in vitro. Increased mRNA expression of these T cell transcripts and MYCN in melanomas was associated with improved overall survival."
"36765925","Enhancer Clusters Drive Type I Interferon-Induced TRAIL Overexpression in Cancer, and Its Intracellular Protein Accumulation Fails to Induce Apoptosis.","Cancers (Basel)","Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a cytokine produced and secreted by immune cells in response to an infection, often in response to interferon (IFN) stimulation. In cancer, it has also been shown that IFN stimulates the production of TRAIL, and it has been proposed that this TRAIL can induce apoptosis in an autocrine or paracrine manner in different cancer cells. Yet, the mechanism mediating TRAIL upregulation and the implications of TRAIL as an apoptotic molecule in cancer cells are still poorly understood. We show here that in certain cancer cells, TRAIL is upregulated by enhancer clusters, potent genomic regulatory regions containing densely packed enhancers that have combinatorial and additive activity and that are usually found to be associated with cancer-promoting genes. Moreover, we found that TRAIL upregulation by IFNα is mediated by these enhancer clusters in breast and lung cancer cells. Surprisingly, IFNα stimulation leads to the intracellular accumulation of TRAIL protein in these cancer cells. Consequently, this TRAIL is not capable of inducing apoptosis. Our study provides novel insights into the mechanism behind the interferon-mediated upregulation of TRAIL and its protein accumulation in cancer cells. Further investigation is required to understand the role of intracellular TRAIL or depict the mechanisms mediating its apoptosis impairment in cancer cells."

In depth bioinformatic analyses (clusterProfiler, WGCNA and SWIMmeR) allowed us to identify the miRNAs, mRNAs and biological processes (BPs) that specifically characterize the response of pigmentable melanoma cells to the drug. Such BPs were studied using appropriate assays in vitro and in vivo (xenograft in zebrafish embryos).Upon vem treatment, miR-192-5p, miR-211-5p, miR-374a-5p, miR-486-5p, miR-582-5p, miR-1260a and miR-7977, as well asGPR143,OCA2,RAB27A,RAB32andTYRP1mRNAs, are differentially expressed only in pigmentable cells. These miRNAs and mRNAs belong to BPs related to pigmentation, specifically melanosome maturation and trafficking. In fact, an increase in the number of intracellular melanosomes-due to increased maturation and/or trafficking-confers resistance to vem.We demonstrated that the ability of pigmentable cells to increase the number of intracellular melanosomes fully accounts for their higher resistance to vem compared to non-pigmentable cells. In addition, we identified a network of miRNAs and mRNAs that are involved in melanosome maturation and/or trafficking. Finally, we provide the rationale for testing BRAFi in combination with inhibitors of these biological processes, so that pigmentable melanoma cells can be turned into more sensitive non-pigmentable cells."
"36765063","Modeling CRISPR-Cas13d on-target and off-target effects using machine learning approaches.","Nat Commun","A major challenge in the application of the CRISPR-Cas13d system is to accurately predict its guide-dependent on-target and off-target effect. Here, we perform CRISPR-Cas13d proliferation screens and design a deep learning model, named DeepCas13, to predict the on-target activity from guide sequences and secondary structures. DeepCas13 outperforms existing methods to predict the efficiency of guides targeting both protein-coding and non-coding RNAs. Guides targeting non-essential genes display off-target viability effects, which are closely related to their on-target efficiencies. Choosing proper negative control guides during normalization mitigates the associated false positives in proliferation screens.

Dysregulated S-palmitoylation is associated with a multitude of human diseases including brain and metabolic disorders, viral infection and cancer. However, the diverse expression patterns of the genes that regulate palmitoylation in the broad range of human cell types are currently unexplored, and their expression in commonly used cell lines that are the workhorse of basic and preclinical research are often overlooked when studying palmitoylation dependent processes. We therefore created CellPalmSeq (https://cellpalmseq.med.ubc.ca), a curated RNAseq database and interactive webtool for visualization of the expression patterns of the genes that regulate palmitoylation across human single cell types, bulk tissue, cancer cell lines and commonly used laboratory non-human cell lines. This resource will allow exploration of these expression patterns, revealing important insights into cellular physiology and disease, and will aid with cell line selection and the interpretation of results when studying important cellular processes that depend on protein S-palmitoylation.Copyright © 2023 Wild, Hogg, Flibotte, Kochhar, Hollman, Haas and Bamji."
"36759728","An antibody-drug conjugate targeting GPR56 demonstrates efficacy in preclinical models of colorectal cancer.","Br J Cancer","Long-term prognosis remains poor for colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with advanced disease due to treatment resistance. The identification of novel targets is essential for the development of new therapeutic approaches. GPR56, an adhesion GPCR, is highly expressed in CRC tumours and correlates with poor survival. Here, we describe the generation and preclinical evaluation of a novel ADC consisting of an anti-GPR56 antibody (10C7) conjugated with the DNA-damaging payload duocarmycin.RNA-seq dataset analysis was performed to determine GPR56 expression in CRC subtypes. The specificity of binding, epitope mapping, and internalisation of 10C7 was examined. 10C7 was conjugated to payload and ADC cytotoxicity was assessed against a panel of CRC cell lines and tumour organoids. Antitumour efficacy was evaluated in xenograft models of CRC cell lines and patient-derived tumours.High GPR56 was shown to be associated with the microsatellite stable (MSS) subtype that accounts for 80-85% of CRC. GPR56 ADC selectively induced cytotoxicity in CRC cells and tumour organoids at low nanomolar potency in a GPR56-dependent manner and showed significant antitumour efficacy against GPR56-expressing xenograft models.This study provides the rationale for the future development of a GPR56-targeted ADC approach to potentially treat a large fraction of MSS CRC patients.© 2023.

Despite this association, a mechanistic understanding of cell cycle phase-dependent metabolic pathway regulation remains elusive. Here we report the mechanism by which human de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis is allosterically regulated during the cell cycle. Combining traditional synchronization methods and metabolomics, we characterize metabolites by their accumulation pattern during cell cycle phases and identify cell cycle phase-dependent regulation of carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2, aspartate transcarbamylase and dihydroorotase (CAD), the first, rate-limiting enzyme in de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. Through systematic mutational scanning and structural modelling, we find allostery as a major regulatory mechanism that controls the activity change of CAD during the cell cycle. Specifically, we report evidence of two Animalia-specific loops in the CAD allosteric domain that involve sensing and binding of uridine 5'-triphosphate, a CAD allosteric inhibitor. Based on homology with a mitochondrial carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase homologue, we identify a critical role for a signal transmission loop in regulating the formation of a substrate channel, thereby controlling CAD activity.© 2023.

Here, we first developed an in silico multiomics approach (BipotentR) to find cancer cell-specific regulators that simultaneously modulate tumor immunity and another oncogenic pathway and then used it to identify 38 candidate immune-metabolic regulators. We show the tumor activities of these regulators stratify patients with melanoma by their response to anti-PD-1 using machine learning and deep neural approaches, which improve the predictive power of current biomarkers. The topmost identified regulator, ESRRA, is activated in immunotherapy-resistant tumors. Its inhibition killed tumors by suppressing energy metabolism and activating two immune mechanisms: (i) cytokine induction, causing proinflammatory macrophage polarization, and (ii) antigen-presentation stimulation, recruiting CD8+ T cells into tumors. We also demonstrate a wide utility of BipotentR by applying it to angiogenesis and growth suppressor evasion pathways. BipotentR (http://bipotentr.dfci.harvard.edu/) provides a resource for evaluating patient response and discovering drug targets that act simultaneously through multiple mechanisms.BipotentR presents resources for evaluating patient response and identifying targets for drugs that can kill tumors through multiple mechanisms concurrently.

It is well known that dysfunctional VPS35 functions in the accumulation of pathogenic proteins. In our previous study, VPS35 was found to be a potential gene related to poor prognosis in gastric cancer. However, the biological functions of VPS35 in gastric cancer remain unclear.Cell viability assays were performed to examine whether VPS35 affected cell proliferation. Immunoprecipitation and biotin assays showed that VPS35 bound to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in the cytoplasm and recycled it to the cell surface. Patient-derived xenografts and organoids were used to evaluate the effect of VPS35 on the response of gastric cancer to EGFR inhibitors.VPS35 expression levels were upregulated in tumour tissues and correlated with local tumour invasion and poor survival in patients with gastric cancer. VPS35 promoted cell proliferation and increased tumour growth. Mechanistically, VPS35 selectively bound to endocytosed EGFR in early endosomes and recycled it back to the cell surface, leading to the downstream activation of the ERK1/2 pathway. We also found that high VPS35 expression levels increased the sensitivity of the xenograft and organoid models to EGFR inhibitors.VPS35 promotes cell proliferation by recycling EGFR to the cell surface, amplifying the network of receptor trafficking. VPS35 expression levels are positively correlated with gastric cancer sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors, which offers a potential method to stratify patients for EGFR inhibitor utilisation.National Natural Science Foundation of China.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

Here, we present a method for generating cell-type-specific genome-scale models from clusters of single-cell RNA-Seq profiles. Specifically, we developed a method to estimate the minimum number of cells required to pool to obtain stable models, a bootstrapping strategy for estimating statistical inference, and a faster version of the task-driven integrative network inference for tissues algorithm for generating context-specific GEMs. In addition, we evaluated the effect of different RNA-Seq normalization methods on model topology and differences in models generated from single-cell and bulk RNA-Seq data. We applied our methods on data from mouse cortex neurons and cells from the tumor microenvironment of lung cancer and in both cases found that almost every cell subtype had a unique metabolic profile. In addition, our approach was able to detect cancer-associated metabolic differences between cancer cells and healthy cells, showcasing its utility. We also contextualized models from 202 single-cell clusters across 19 human organs using data from Human Protein Atlas and made these available in the web portal Metabolic Atlas, thereby providing a valuable resource to the scientific community. With the ever-increasing availability of single-cell RNA-Seq datasets and continuously improved GEMs, their combination holds promise to become an important approach in the study of human metabolism."

Integrative analysis was performed to explore drug candidates according to genetic variants, gene expression, and clinical profiles.PDCs had genomic characteristics resembled with those of solid lung cancer tissues. PDC molecular subtyping classified patients into four groups: (1) inflammatory, (2) epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like, (3) stemness, and (4) epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR)-dominant. EGFR mutations of the EMT-like subtype were associated with a reduced response to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. Moreover, although RB1/TP53 mutations were significantly enriched in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) PDCs, they were also present in non-SCLC PDCs. In contrast to its effect in the cell lines, alpelisib (a PI3K-AKT inhibitor) significantly inhibited both RB1/TP53 expression and SCLC cell growth in our PDC model. Furthermore, cell cycle inhibitors could effectively target SCLC cells. Finally, the upregulation of transforming growth factor-β expression and the YAP/TAZ pathway was observed in osimertinib-resistant PDCs, predisposing them to the EMT-like subtype. Our platform selected XAV939 (a WNT-TNKS-β-catenin inhibitor) for the treatment of osimertinib-resistant PDCs. Using an in vitro model, we further demonstrated that acquisition of osimertinib resistance enhances invasive characteristics and EMT, upregulates the YAP/TAZ-AXL axis, and increases the sensitivity of cancer cells to XAV939.Our PDC models recapitulated the molecular characteristics of lung cancer, and pharmacogenomics analysis provided plausible therapeutic candidates.© 2023.

Such tools require the user to input the MHC alleles and peptide sequences of interest, as well as the abundance levels of the peptides' source proteins. However, such expression data is often not directly available to users, and retrieving the expression level of a peptide's source antigen from public databases is not trivial. We have developed the Peptide eXpression annotator (pepX), which takes a peptide as input, identifies from which proteins the peptide can be derived, and returns an estimate of the expression level of those source proteins from selected public databases. We have also investigated how the abundance level of a peptide can be best estimated in cases when it can originate from multiple transcripts and proteins and found that summing up transcript-level expression values performs best in distinguishing ligands from decoy peptides.Copyright © 2023 Frentzen, Greenbaum, Kim, Peters and Koşaloğlu-Yalçın."

However, the costly investment of time and labor associated with wet-lab experimental screenings to discover potential SL relationships motivates the development of computational methods. Although graph neural network (GNN) models have performed well in the prediction of SL gene pairs, existing GNN-based models are not designed for predicting cancer cell-specific SL interactions that are more relevant to experimental validationin vitro. Besides, neither have existing methods fully utilized diverse graph representations of biological features to improve prediction performance. In this work, we propose MVGCN-iSL, a novel multi-view graph convolutional network (GCN) model to predict cancer cell-specific SL gene pairs, by incorporating five biological graph features and multi-omics data. Max pooling operation is applied to integrate five graph-specific representations obtained from GCN models. Afterwards, a deep neural network (DNN) model serves as the prediction module to predict the SL interactions in individual cancer cells (iSL).

Yet, their downstream oncogenic signaling mechanisms are poorly understood. We used global phosphoproteomics and kinase activity profiling to map conserved signaling outputs driven by a range of genetic changes that activate PKA in human cancer. Two signaling networks were identified downstream of PKA: RAS/MAPK components and an Aurora Kinase A (AURKA)/glycogen synthase kinase (GSK3) sub-network with activity toward MYC oncoproteins. Findings were validated in two PKA-dependent cancer models: a novel, patient-derived fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) line that expresses a DNAJ-PKAc fusion and a PKA-addicted melanoma model with a mutant type I PKA regulatory subunit. We identify PKA signals that can influence both de novo translation and stability of the proto-oncogene c-MYC. However, the primary mechanism of PKA effects on MYC in our cell models was translation and could be blocked with the eIF4A inhibitor zotatifin. This compound dramatically reduced c-MYC expression and inhibited FLC cell line growth in vitro. Thus, targeting PKA effects on translation is a potential treatment strategy for FLC and other PKA-driven cancers.© 2023, Chan et al."

The present study aimed to explore the effect of GBP2 on tumor progression and its possible underlying molecular mechanisms in ccRCC. The Cancer Genome Atlas, Gene Expression Omnibus, Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia databases, and several bioinformatics analysis tools, such as Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis 2, Kaplan‑Meier plotter, UALCAN, LinkedOmics, Metascape, GeneMANIA and Tumor Immune Estimation Resource, were used to characterize the functional relationship between GBP2 and ccRCC. Focusing on the association between GBP2 and programmed death ligand 1 (PD‑L1)in vitro, the regulatory mechanism was investigated by knockdown and overexpression of GBP2 in Caki‑1 and 786‑O cells using reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR, western blotting and co‑immunoprecipitation techniques. The results indicated that GBP2 was commonly upregulated in ccRCC, correlating with worse prognosis. In addition, GBP2 expression levels were positively associated with different patterns of immune cell infiltration, suggesting that the GBP2 gene regulates PD‑L1 expression via the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) pathway.

"36630954","Human SMARCA5 is continuously required to maintain nucleosome spacing.","Mol Cell","Genetic models suggested that SMARCA5 was required for DNA-templated events including transcription, DNA replication, and DNA repair. We engineered a degron tag into the endogenous alleles of SMARCA5, a catalytic component of the imitation switch complexes in three different human cell lines to define the effects of rapid degradation of this key regulator. Degradation of SMARCA5 was associated with a rapid increase in global nucleosome repeat length, which may allow greater chromatin compaction. However, there were few changes in nascent transcription within the first 6 h of degradation. Nevertheless, we demonstrated a requirement for SMARCA5 to control nucleosome repeat length at G1/S and during the S phase. SMARCA5 co-localized with CTCF and H2A.Z, and we found a rapid loss of CTCF DNA binding and disruption of nucleosomal phasing around CTCF binding sites.

"36733939","Clinical and molecular significance of the RNA m(6)A methyltransferase complex in prostate cancer.","Front Genet","N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant internal mRNA modification and is dynamically regulated through distinct protein complexes that methylate, demethylate, and/or interpret the m6A modification. These proteins, and the m6A modification, are involved in the regulation of gene expression, RNA stability, splicing and translation. Given its role in these crucial processes, m6A has been implicated in many diseases, including in cancer development and progression. Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most commonly diagnosed non-cutaneous cancer in men and recent studies support a role for m6A in PCa. Despite this, the literature currently lacks an integrated analysis of the expression of key components of the m6A RNA methyltransferase complex, both in PCa patients and in well-established cell line models. For this reason, this study used immunohistochemistry and functional studies to investigate the mechanistic and clinical significance of the METTL3, METTL14, WTAP and CBLL1 components of the m6A methyltransferase complex in PCa specimens and cell lines. Expression of METTL3 and CBLL1, but not METTL14 and WTAP, was associated with poorer PCa patient outcomes. Expression of METTL3, METTL14, WTAP and CBLL1 was higher in PCa cells compared with non-malignant prostate cells, with the highest expression seen in castrate-sensitive, androgen-responsive PCa cells. Moreover, in PCa cell lines, expression of METTL3 and WTAP was found to be androgen-regulated. To investigate the mechanistic role(s) of the m6A methyltransferase complex in PCa cells, short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown coupled with next generation sequencing was used to determine the transcriptome-wide roles of METTL3, the catalytic subunit of the m6A methyltransferase complex. Functional depletion ofMETTL3resulted in upregulation of the androgen receptor (AR), together with 134 AR-regulated genes.METTL3knockdown also resulted in altered splicing, and enrichment of cell cycle, DNA repair and metabolic pathways. Collectively, this study identified the functional and clinical significance of four essential m6A complex components in PCa patient specimens and cell lines for the first time.

Recent studies investigating mRNA expression in human pancreatic islets have yielded important insights into the molecular drivers of normal islet function and T2D pathophysiology. However, similar studies investigating microRNA (miRNA) expression remain limited. Here, we present data from 63 individuals, the largest sequencing-based analysis of miRNA expression in human islets to date. We characterized the genetic regulation of miRNA expression by decomposing the expression of highly heritable miRNAs intocis-andtrans-acting genetic components and mappingcis-acting loci associated with miRNA expression [miRNA-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)]. We found i) 84 heritable miRNAs, primarily regulated bytrans-acting genetic effects, and ii) 5 miRNA-eQTLs. We also used several different strategies to identify T2D-associated miRNAs. First, we colocalized miRNA-eQTLs with genetic loci associated with T2D and multiple glycemic traits, identifying one miRNA, miR-1908, that shares genetic signals for blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). Next, we intersected miRNA seed regions and predicted target sites with credible set SNPs associated with T2D and glycemic traits and found 32 miRNAs that may have altered binding and function due to disrupted seed regions. Finally, we performed differential expression analysis and identified 14 miRNAs associated with T2D status-including miR-187-3p, miR-21-5p, miR-668, and miR-199b-5p-and 4 miRNAs associated with a polygenic score for HbA1c levels-miR-216a, miR-25, miR-30a-3p, and miR-30a-5p."

Here, we investigated the inflammation changes in peripheral blood system of CD patients, which are less reported in China. Peripheral blood samples of 167 CD patients and 30 healthy people, as well as their clinical information, were collected at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University. Flow cytometry was performed to analyze the ratio of CD4 T cells to CD8 T cells. Cytometric Bead Array kit was used to detect the cytokines in peripheral blood in CD patients. Moreover, the expression of inflammasomes was also detected by RT-PCR. The percentage and cell number of lymphocytes in CD patients' peripheral blood system decreased significantly, while monocytes increased remarkably. Interestingly, there was an inversion of the CD4 T cells/CD8 T cells ratio in peripheral blood of CD patients. The levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) increased significantly in CD patients' peripheral blood, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation aggravate inflammatory response. In addition, the expression of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family, pyrin domain-containing 1 (NLRP1) and NLRP3 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of CD patients increased significantly after LPS stimulation.

"36711772","Unique Transcriptional Signatures Correlate with Behavioral and Psychological Symptom Domains in Alzheimer's Disease.","Res Sq","Despite the significant burden, cost, and worse prognosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) with Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD), little is known about the molecular causes of these symptoms. Using antemortem assessments of BPSD in AD, we demonstrate that individual BPSD can be grouped into 4 domain factors in our sample: Affective, Apathy, Agitation, and Psychosis. Then, we performed a transcriptome-wide analysis for each domain utilizing bulk RNA-seq of post-mortem Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) tissue. Though all 4 domains are associated with a predominantly downregulated pattern of hundreds of DEGs, most DEGs are unique to each domain, with only 22 DEGs being common to all BPSD domains, including TIMP1. Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) yielded multiple transcriptional modules that were shared between BPSD domains or unique to each domain, and NetDecoder was used to analyze context-dependent information flow through the biological network. For the agitation domain, we found that all DEGs and a highly correlated transcriptional module were functionally enriched for ECM-related genes including TIMP1, TAGLN, and FLNA. Another unique transcriptional module also associated with the agitation domain was enriched with genes involved in post-synaptic signaling, including DRD1, PDE1B, CAMK4, and GABRA4. By comparing context-dependent changes in DEGs between cases and control networks, ESR1 and PARK2 were implicated as two high impact genes associated with agitation that mediated significant information flow through the biological network. Overall, our work establishes unique targets for future study of the biological mechanisms of BPSD and resultant drug development."

We demonstrate that ancestry, sex, age, and BMI make additive and tissue-specific contributions to expression variability, whereas interactions are rare. Variation in splicing is dominated by ancestry and is under genetic control in most tissues, with ribosomal proteins showing a strong enrichment of tissue-shared splicing events.

It is known that more than 10% of women smoke during their pregnancy, and recent surveys show that rates of maternal vaping are similar to rates of maternal cigarette smoking. However, the effects of inhaling e-cig aerosol on the health of fetuses remain unknown. The objective of the present study was to increase our understanding of the molecular effects caused by in utero exposures to e-cig aerosols on developing mouse lungs and, later in life, on the offspring's susceptibility to developing asthma.Pregnant mice were exposed throughout gestation to either filtered air or vanilla-flavored e-cig aerosols containing 18 mg/mL of nicotine. Male and female exposed mouse offspring were sacrificed at birth, and then the lung transcriptome was evaluated. Additionally, once sub-groups of male offspring mice reached 4 weeks of age, they were challenged with house dust mites (HDMs) for 3 weeks to assess asthmatic responses.The lung transcriptomic responses of the mouse offspring at birth showed that in utero vanilla-flavored e-cig aerosol exposure significantly regulated 88 genes in males (62 genes were up-regulated and 26 genes were down-regulated), and 65 genes were significantly regulated in females (17 genes were up-regulated and 48 genes were down-regulated). Gene network analyses revealed that in utero e-cig aerosol exposure affected canonical pathways associated with CD28 signaling in T helper cells, the role of NFAT in the regulation of immune responses, and phospholipase C signaling in males, whereas the dysregulated genes in the female offspring were associated with NRF2-mediated oxidative stress responses. Moreover, we found that in utero exposures to vanilla-flavored e-cig aerosol exacerbated HDM-induced asthma in 7-week-old male mouse offspring compared to respective in utero air + HDM controls.Overall, these data demonstrate that in utero e-cig aerosol exposure alters the developing mouse lung transcriptome at birth in a sex-specific manner and provide evidence that the inhalation of e-cig aerosols is detrimental to the respiratory health of offspring by increasing the offspring' susceptibility to developing lung diseases later in life."
"36767658","Air Pollution and Birth Outcomes: Health Impact and Economic Value Assessment in Spain.","Int J Environ Res Public Health","Air pollution is considered an ongoing major public health and environmental issue around the globe, affecting the most vulnerable, such as pregnant women and fetuses. The aim of this study is to estimate the health impact and economic value on birth outcomes, such as low birthweight (LBW), preterm birth (PTB), small for gestational age (SGA), attributable to a reduction of PM10levels in Spain. Reduction based on four scenarios was implemented: fulfillment of WHO guidelines and EU limits, and an attributable reduction of 15% and 50% in annual PM10levels. Retrospective study on 288,229 live-born singleton children born between 2009-2010, using data from Spain Birth Registry Statistics database, as well as mean PM10mass concentrations. Our finding showed that a decrease in annual exposure to PM10appears to be associated with a decrease in the annual cases of LBW, SGA and PTB, as well as a reduction in hospital cost attributed to been born with LBW. Improving pregnancy outcomes by reducing the number of LBW up to 5% per year, will result in an estimate associated monetary saving of 50,000 to 7,000,000 euros annually. This study agrees with previous literature and highlights the need to implement, and ensure compliance with, stricter policies that regulate the maximum exposure to outdoor PM permitted in Spain, contributing to decreased environmental health risk, especially negative birth outcomes."
"36831404","Potential Pathophysiological Pathways in the Complex Relationships between OSA and Cancer.","Cancers (Basel)","Several epidemiological and clinical studies have suggested a relationship between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and a higher incidence or severity of cancer. This relationship appears to be dependent on a myriad of factors. These include non-modifiable factors, such as age and gender; and modifiable or preventable factors, such as specific comorbidities (especially obesity), the use of particular treatments, and, above all, the histological type or location of the cancer. Heterogeneity in the relationship between OSA and cancer is also related to the influences of intermittent hypoxemia (a hallmark feature of OSA), among others, on metabolism and the microenvironment of different types of tumoral cells. The hypoxia inducible transcription factor (HIF-1α), a molecule activated and expressed in situations of hypoxemia, seems to be key to enabling a variety of pathophysiological mechanisms that are becoming increasingly better recognized. These mechanisms appear to be operationally involved via alterations in different cellular functions (mainly involving the immune system) and molecular functions, and by inducing modifications in the microbiome. This, in turn, may individually or collectively increase the risk of cancer, which is then, further modulated by the genetic susceptibility of the individual. Here, we provide an updated and brief review of the different pathophysiological pathways that have been identified and could explain the relationship between OSA and cancer. We also identify future challenges that need to be overcome in this intriguing field of research."
"36781861","Amniotes co-opt intrinsic genetic instability to protect germ-line genome integrity.","Nat Commun","Unlike PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) in other species that mostly target transposable elements (TEs), >80% of piRNAs in adult mammalian testes lack obvious targets. However, mammalian piRNA sequences and piRNA-producing loci evolve more rapidly than the rest of the genome for unknown reasons. Here, through comparative studies of chickens, ducks, mice, and humans, as well as long-read nanopore sequencing on diverse chicken breeds, we find that piRNA loci across amniotes experience: (1) a high local mutation rate of structural variations (SVs, mutations ≥ 50 bp in size); (2) positive selection to suppress young and actively mobilizing TEs commencing at the pachytene stage of meiosis during germ cell development; and (3) negative selection to purge deleterious SV hotspots. Our results indicate that genetic instability at pachytene piRNA loci, while producing certain pathogenic SVs, also protects genome integrity against TE mobilization by driving the formation of rapid-evolving piRNA sequences.© 2023.

For example, in the context of genomic selection (GS), breeders need genome-wide markers to predict the breeding value of large cohorts of progenies, requiring the genotyping of thousands candidates. Here, we introduce 3D-GBS, an optimized GBS procedure, to provide an ultra-high-throughput and ultra-low-cost genotyping solution for species with small to medium-sized genome and illustrate its use in soybean. Using a combination of three restriction enzymes (PstI/NsiI/MspI), the portion of the genome that is captured was reduced fourfold (compared to a ""standard"" ApeKI-based protocol) while reducing the number of markers by only 40%. By better focusing the sequencing effort on limited set of restriction fragments, fourfold more samples can be genotyped at the same minimal depth of coverage. This GBS protocol also resulted in a lower proportion of missing data and provided a more uniform distribution of SNPs across the genome. Moreover, we investigated the optimal number of reads per sample needed to obtain an adequate number of markers for GS and QTL mapping (500-1000 markers per biparental cross). This optimization allows sequencing costs to be decreased by ~ 92% and ~ 86% for GS and QTL mapping studies, respectively, compared to previously published work. Overall, 3D-GBS represents a unique and affordable solution for applications requiring extremely high-throughput genotyping where cost remains the most limiting factor.© 2023. The Author(s)."

The low-dimensional representation of cells enables the identification of distinct cell types, and the feature by factor loading matrices help characterize cell-type specific markers and provide rich biological insights on the functional pathway enrichment analysis. iPoLNG is also able to handle the setting of partial information where certain modality of the cells is missing.

Batch effects among different datasets are inevitable because of differences in cell isolation and handling protocols, library preparation technology, and sequencing platforms. To remove these batch effects for effective integration of multiple scRNA-seq datasets, a number of methodologies have been developed based on diverse concepts and approaches. These methods have proven useful for examining whether cellular features, such as cell subpopulations and marker genes, identified from a certain dataset, are consistently present, or whether their condition-dependent variations, such as increases in cell subpopulations in particular disease-related conditions, are consistently observed in different datasets generated under similar or distinct conditions. In this review, we summarize the concepts and approaches of the integration methods and their pros and cons as has been reported in previous literature."

With the increasing scale of scRNA-seq studies, the major challenge is correcting batch effect and accurately detecting the number of cell types, which is inevitable in human studies. The majority of scRNA-seq algorithms have been specifically designed to remove batch effect firstly and then conduct clustering, which may miss some rare cell types. Here we develop scDML, a deep metric learning model to remove batch effect in scRNA-seq data, guided by the initial clusters and the nearest neighbor information intra and inter batches. Comprehensive evaluations spanning different species and tissues demonstrated that scDML can remove batch effect, improve clustering performance, accurately recover true cell types and consistently outperform popular methods such as Seurat 3, scVI, Scanorama, BBKNN, Harmony et al. Most importantly, scDML preserves subtle cell types in raw data and enables discovery of new cell subtypes that are hard to extract by analyzing each batch individually. We also show that scDML is scalable to large datasets with lower peak memory usage, and we believe that scDML offers a valuable tool to study complex cellular heterogeneity.© 2023. The Author(s)."

However, the heterogeneity of T cells, in terms of differentiation and activation status, the effector function, and highly diverse T cell receptors (TCRs) have thus precluded us from tracking these T cells and thereby comprehending their fate in recipients due to the limitations of traditional detection approaches. Recently, with the widespread development of single-cell techniques, the identification and characterization of T cells have been performed at single-cell resolution, which has contributed to a deeper comprehension of T cell heterogeneity by relevant detections in a single cell - such as gene expression, DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility, surface proteins, and TCR. Although these approaches can provide valuable insights into an individual cell independently, a comprehensive understanding can be obtained when applied joint analysis. Multi-omics techniques have been implemented in characterizing T cells in health and disease, including transplantation.

Clinical statistics revealed that senior GBM patients had a worse overall survival (OS) comparing with that of patients in other ages, which is mainly related with tumor microenvironment including tumor-associated immune cells in particular. However, the immune heterogeneity and age-related prognosis in GBM are under studied. Here we developed a machine learning-based method to integrate public large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets to establish a comprehensive atlas of immune cells infiltrating in cross-age GBM. We found that the compositions of the immune cells are remarkably different across ages. Brain-resident microglia constitute the majority of glioblastoma-associated macrophages (GAMs) in patients, whereas dramatic elevation of extracranial monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) is observed in GAMs of senior patients, which contributes to the worse prognosis of aged patients. Further analysis suggests that the increased MDMs arisen from excessive recruitment and proliferation of peripheral monocytes not only lead to the T cell function inhibition in GBM, but also stimulate tumor cells proliferationviaVEGFA secretion. In summary, our work provides new cues for the correlational relationship between the immune microenvironment of GBM and aging, which might be insightful for precise and effective therapeutic interventions for senior GBM patients.Copyright © 2023 Wu, Li, Hong, Chen, Yu, Guo, Xie, Xiao, Kong, Mo, Wang, Chen and Zeng."

We formulate a unifying, data-driven, integrative, and predictive methodology for different libraries, samples, and paired-unpaired data modalities. Our design of scAEGAN includes an autoencoder (AE) network integrated with adversarial learning by a cycleGAN (cGAN) network. The AE learns a low-dimensional embedding of each condition, whereas the cGAN learns a non-linear mapping between the AE representations. We evaluate scAEGAN using simulated data and real scRNA-seq datasets, different library preparations (Fluidigm C1, CelSeq, CelSeq2, SmartSeq), and several data modalities as paired scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq. The scAEGAN outperforms Seurat3 in library integration, is more robust against data sparsity, and beats Seurat 4 in integrating paired data from the same cell. Furthermore, in predicting one data modality from another, scAEGAN outperforms Babel. We conclude that scAEGAN surpasses current state-of-the-art methods and unifies integration and prediction challenges.Copyright: © 2023 Khan et al.

Since no technology can provide complete characterization across all layers of biological modalities within the same cell, there is pervasive need for computational cross-modal integration (also called diagonal integration) of single-cell and spatial omics data. For current methods, the feasibility of cross-modal integration relies on the existence of highly correlated, a priori ""linked"" features. When such linked features are few or uninformative, a scenario that we call ""weak linkage"", existing methods fail. We developed MaxFuse, a cross-modal data integration method that, through iterative co-embedding, data smoothing, and cell matching, leverages all information in each modality to obtain high-quality integration. MaxFuse is modality-agnostic and, through comprehensive benchmarks on single-cell and spatial ground-truth multiome datasets, demonstrates high robustness and accuracy in the weak linkage scenario. A prototypical example of weak linkage is the integration of spatial proteomic data with single-cell sequencing data. On two example analyses of this type, we demonstrate how MaxFuse enables the spatial consolidation of proteomic, transcriptomic and epigenomic information at single-cell resolution on the same tissue section."

We overcome the high sparsity of the scATAC-seq data by using an imputation strategy that exploits the less-sparse scRNA-seq data available from the same cell. Subsequently, scMoC identifies clusters of cells by merging clusterings derived from both data domains individually. We tested scMoC on datasets generated using different protocols with variable data sparsity levels.

Here, we utilized single-cell RNA sequencing and whole-exome sequencing data of glioblastoma (GBM) tissues and identified a subset of TAMs dually expressing macrophage and tumor signatures, which were termed double-positive TAMs. Double-positive TAMs tended to be bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) and were characterized by immunosuppressive phenotypes. Phagocytosis of glioma cells by BMDMs in vitro generated double-positive TAMs with similar immunosuppressive phenotypes to double-positive TAMs in the GBM TME of patients. The double-positive TAMs were transformed into M2-like macrophages and drove immunosuppression by expressing immune-checkpoint proteins CD276, PD-L1, and PD-L2 and suppressing the proliferation of activated T cells. Together, glioma cell phagocytosis by BMDMs in the TME leads to the formation of double-positive TAMs with enhanced immunosuppressive phenotypes, shedding light on the processes driving TAM-mediated immunosuppression in GBM.Bone marrow-derived macrophages phagocytose glioblastoma cells to form double-positive cells, dually expressing macrophage and tumor signatures that are transformed into M2-like macrophages and drive immunosuppression.©2023 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research."

As VD plays a key role in maintaining normal glucose and lipid metabolism, maternal VD deficiency may lead to obesity and other obesity-related diseases among offspring later in life. This review mainly focuses on the effect of maternal VD deficiency on offspring lipid metabolism, reviewing previous clinical and animal studies to determine the effects of maternal VD deficit on offspring obesity and potential mechanisms involved in the progression of offspring obesity. Emerging clinical evidence shows that a low VD level may lead to abnormal growth (either growth restriction or largeness for gestational age) and lipid and glucose metabolism disorders in offspring. Here, we also outline the link between maternal VD deficiency and life-long offspring effects, including the disorder of adipogenesis, the secretion of adipocytokines (including leptin, resistin, and adiponectin), activated systemic inflammation, increased oxidative reactions in adipose tissue, insulin resistance, and abnormal intestinal gut microbiota. Thus, there is an urgent need to take active steps to address maternal VD deficiency to relieve the global burden of obesity."

This study determined whether the exposure to air pollutants was an independent risk factor for pSS.Participants were enrolled from a population-based cohort registry. Daily average concentrations of air pollutants from 2000 to 2011 were divided into 4 quartiles. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) of pSS for exposure to air pollutants were estimated in a Cox proportional regression model adjusting for age, sex, socioeconomic status, and residential areas. A subgroup analysis stratified by sex was conducted to validate the findings. Windows of susceptibility indicated years of exposure which contributed the most to the observed association. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was used to identify underlying pathways of air pollutant-associated pSS pathogenesis, using Z-score visualization.Two hundred patients among 177,307 participants developed pSS, with a mean age of 53.1 years at acumulative incidence of 0.11% from 2000 to 2011. Exposure to carbon monoxide (CO), nitric oxide (NO), and methane (CH4) was associated with a higher risk of pSS. Compared to those exposed to the lowest concentration level, the aHRs for pSS were 2.04 (95%CI=1.29-3.25), 1.86 (95%CI=1.22-2.85), and 2.21 (95%CI=1.47-3.31) for those exposed to high levels of CO, NO, and CH4, respectively. The findings persisted in the subgroup analysis, in which females exposed to high levels of CO, NO, and CH4 and males exposed to high levels of CO were associated with significantly great risk of pSS. The cumulative effect of air pollution on pSS was time-dependent. The underlying cellular mechanisms involved chronic inflammatory pathways including the interleukin-6 signaling pathway.Exposure to CO, NO, and CH4 was associated with a high risk of pSS, which was biologically plausible.Copyright © 2023 Ma, Wang, Chong, Lin, Li, Chen and Wei."

"36769199","Alzheimer's Precision Neurology: Epigenetics of Cytochrome P450 Genes in Circulating Cell-Free DNA for Disease Prediction and Mechanism.","Int J Mol Sci","Precision neurology combines high-throughput technologies and statistical modeling to identify novel disease pathways and predictive biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Brain cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes are major regulators of cholesterol, sex hormone, and xenobiotic metabolism, and they could play important roles in neurodegenerative disorders. Increasing evidence suggests that epigenetic factors contribute to AD development. We evaluated cytosine ('CpG')-based DNA methylation changes in AD using circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA), to which neuronal cells are known to contribute. We investigated CYP-based mechanisms for AD pathogenesis and epigenetic biomarkers for disease detection. We performed a case-control study using 25 patients with AD and 23 cognitively healthy controls using the cfDNA of CYP genes. We performed a logistic regression analysis using the MetaboAnalyst software computer program and a molecular pathway analysis based on epigenetically altered CYP genes using the Cytoscape program. We identified 130 significantly (false discovery rate correction q-value < 0.05) differentially methylated CpG sites within the CYP genes. The top two differentially methylated genes identified wereCYP51A1andCYP2S1. The significant molecular pathways that were perturbed in AD cfDNA were (i) androgen and estrogen biosynthesis and metabolism, (ii) C21 steroid hormone biosynthesis and metabolism, and (iii) arachidonic acid metabolism. Existing evidence suggests a potential role of each of these biochemical pathways in AD pathogenesis. Next, we randomly divided the study group into discovery and validation sub-sets, each consisting of patients with AD and control patients. Regression models for AD prediction based on CYP CpG methylation markers were developed in the discovery or training group and tested in the independent validation group. The CYP biomarkers achieved a high predictive accuracy. After a 10-fold cross-validation, the combination of cg17852385/cg23101118 + cg14355428/cg22536554 achieved an AUC (95% CI) of 0.928 (0.787~1.00), with 100% sensitivity and 92.3% specificity for AD detection in the discovery group. The performance remained high in the independent validation or test group, achieving an AUC (95% CI) of 0.942 (0.905~0.979) with a 90% sensitivity and specificity.

This study was aimed to assess the association of maternal overall and type-specific HDPs with diabetes in offspring from childhood to early adulthood.Using Danish national health registers, a total of 2,448,753 individuals born in Denmark from 1978 to 2018 were included in this study. Maternal HDP included chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, and preeclampsia. The outcome of interest was diabetes in offspring (including type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes). The follow-up of offspring started at birth and ended at the first diagnosis of diabetes, emigration from Denmark, death, or time end on 31 December 2018, whichever came first. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to evaluate the hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the association between maternal HDP and diabetes (including type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes) in offspring from birth to young adulthood (up to 41 years), with the offspring's age as the time scale.During a follow-up of up to 41 (median: 19.3) years, 1247 offspring born to mothers with HDP and 23,645 offspring born to mothers without HDP were diagnosed with diabetes. Compared with offspring born to mothers without HDP, those born to mothers with HDP had an increased risk for overall diabetes (HR=1.27, 95% CI=1.20-1.34), as well as for type 2 diabetes (HR=1.57, 95% CI=1.38-1.78) and gestational diabetes (HR=1.37, 95% CI=1.25-1.49). We did not observe obvious increased risk for type 1 diabetes (HR=1.08, 95% CI=0.98-1.18). Offspring of mothers with gestational hypertension (HR=1.37, 95% CI=1.00-1.88) or preeclampsia (HR=1.62, 95% CI=1.41-1.87) had higher risks of type 2 diabetes. The strongest association was observed for severe preeclampsia, with a 2-fold risk of type 2 diabetes (HR=2.00, 95% CI=1.42-2.82). The association between maternal HDP and type 1 diabetes did not reach statistical significance, except for maternal gestational hypertension (HR=1.41, 95%CI=1.17-1.71). In addition, we found that offspring born to mothers with any subtypes of maternal HDP had higher risk of gestational diabetes, and the corresponding HRs (95%CIs) for chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, and preeclampsia were 1.60 (1.06-2.41), 1.29 (1.04-1.59), and 1.38 (1.24-1.53), respectively. We also observed stronger associations among offspring of mothers with HDP and comorbid diabetes (HR=4.64, 95%CI=3.85-5.60) than offspring of mothers with HDP or diabetes alone.Offspring of mothers with HDP, especially mothers with comorbid diabetes, had an increased risk of diabetes later in their life. Our findings suggest that timely and effective prevention of HDP in women of childbearing age should be taken into consideration as diabetes prevention and control strategies for their generations.© 2023.

Over the past two decades, the prevalence of autism spectrum disorders has progressively increased, however, no clear diagnostic markers and specifically targeted medications for autism have emerged. As a result, neurobehavioral abnormalities, neurobiological alterations in ASD, and the development of novel ASD pharmacological therapy necessitate multidisciplinary collaboration. In this review, we discuss the development of multiple animal models of ASD to contribute to the disease mechanisms of ASD, as well as new studies from multiple disciplines to assess the behavioral pathology of ASD. In addition, we summarize and highlight the mechanistic advances regarding gene transcription, RNA and non-coding RNA translation, abnormal synaptic signaling pathways, epigenetic post-translational modifications, brain-gut axis, immune inflammation and neural loop abnormalities in autism to provide a theoretical basis for the next step of precision therapy. Furthermore, we review existing autism therapy tactics and limits and present challenges and opportunities for translating multidisciplinary knowledge of ASD into clinical practice."
"36711631","Sex-biased expression is associated with chromatin state in D. melanogaster and D. simulans.","bioRxiv","We propose a new model for the association of chromatin state and sex-bias in expression. We hypothesize enrichment of open chromatin in the sex where we see expression bias (OS) and closed chromatin in the opposite sex (CO). In this study ofD. melanogasterandD. simulanshead tissue, sex-bias in expression is associated with H3K4me3 (open mark) in males for male-biased genes and in females for female-biased genes in both species. Sex-bias in expression is also largely conserved in direction and magnitude between the two species on the X and autosomes. In male-biased orthologs, the sex-bias ratio is more divergent between species if both species have H3K27me2me3 marks in females compared to when either or neither species has H3K27me2me3 in females. H3K27me2me3 marks in females are associated with male-bias in expression on the autosomes in both species, but on the X only inD. melanogaster. In female-biased orthologs the relationship between the species for the sex-bias ratio is similar regardless of the H3K27me2me3 marks in males. Female-biased orthologs are more similar in the ratio of sex-bias than male-biased orthologs and there is an excess of male-bias in expression in orthologs that gain/lose sex-bias. There is an excess of male-bias in sex-limited expression in both species suggesting excess male-bias is due to rapid evolution between the species. The X chromosome has an enrichment in male-limited H3K4me3 in both species and an enrichment of sex-bias in expression compared to the autosomes."

And an analysis of two types of lung cancer was conducted to construct a systematic prognostic landscape. Finally, putative binding site of the triacetylresveratrol bound to SIRT2 was built from homology modeling.We concluded that higher mRNA and protein levels of SIRT2 affected prognosis in various types of cancers, especially in LUAD cohorts. In addition, SIRT2 is linked with a better overall survival (OS) in LUAD patients. Further research suggested a possible explanation for this phenotype might be that SIRT2 mRNA levels are positively correlated with infiltrating status of multiple immunocytes in LU-AD but not LUSC, i.e. SIRT2 expression may contribute to the recruitment of CD8+T cell, CD4+ T cell, T cell CD4+ memory resting, Tregs, T cell NK and positively correlated to the expression of PD-1, also excluding neutrophil, T cell CD8+ naïve and B cell plasma cells in LUAD. We found that triacetyl-resveratrol demonstrated the most potent agonist efficiency to SIRT2 and the EC 50 as low as 142.79 nM. As a result, SIRT2 appears to be a promising novel biomarker for prognosis prediction in patients with LUAD and triacetylresveratrol might be a potential immunomodulator of LUAD to anti-PD-1 based immunotherapy combination therapies.Copyright © 2023 He, Qiu, Zhou, Meng, Liu, Li, Du, Sun and Wang."

Scientists proposed that HSP70 might be implicated in increased cancer cell survival. This study aimed to investigate theHSP70(HSPA4) gene expression signature in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in correlation to cancer subtype, stage, grade, and recurrence, combining both clinicopathological and in silico analysis approaches. One hundred and thirty archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples, including 65 RCC tissue specimens and their paired non-cancerous tissues, were included in the study. Total RNA was extracted from each sample and analyzed using TaqMan quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction. Correlation and validation to the available clinicopathological data and results were executed. UpregulatedHSP70(HSPA4) gene expression was evident in RCC compared to non-cancer tissues in the studied cohort and was validated by in silico analysis. Furthermore,HSP70expression levels showed significant positive correlations with cancer size, grade, and capsule infiltration, as well as recurrence in RCC patients. The expression levels negatively correlated with the overall survival (r= -0.87,p< 0.001). Kaplan-Meier curves showed lower survival rates in high HSP70 expressor group compared to the low expressors. In conclusion, the HSP70 expression levels are associated with poor RCC prognosis in terms of advanced grade, capsule infiltration, recurrence, and short survival."

Furthermore, we conducted single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) to analyze immune infiltration and investigate microRNA crosstalk and methylation for prognostic genes using online databases.We identified 84 DEGs in CRPC related to ferroptosis and 19 hub genes densely connected into networks by enrichment analysis. We performed survival analysis and Cox regression for these genes and identified LAMP2 with significantly prognostic values in overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) of prostate cancer. Furthermore, we found immune infiltration of various immune cells significantly correlated with LAMP2 expression in prostate cancer and identified multiple microRNAs associated with LAMP2 expression in prostate cancer. In addition, we found that the methylation level of LAMP2 in prostate cancer was significantly associated with cancer and identified 8 methylation sites for LAMP2.Ferroptosis-related gene LAMP2 is a potential biomarker with prognostic value for prostate cancer.Copyright © 2023 Chuanyu Sun et al."
"36829533","The Emerging Role of Epigenetics in Metabolism and Endocrinology.","Biology (Basel)","Each cell in a multicellular organism has its own phenotype despite sharing the same genome. Epigenetics is a somatic, heritable pattern of gene expression or cellular phenotype mediated by structural changes in chromatin that occur without altering the DNA sequence. Epigenetic modification is an important factor in determining the level and timing of gene expression in response to endogenous and exogenous stimuli. There is also growing evidence concerning the interaction between epigenetics and metabolism. Accordingly, several enzymes that consume vital metabolites as substrates or cofactors are used during the catalysis of epigenetic modification. Therefore, altered metabolism might lead to diseases and pathogenesis, including endocrine disorders and cancer. In addition, it has been demonstrated that epigenetic modification influences the endocrine system and immune response-related pathways. In this regard, epigenetic modification may impact the levels of hormones that are important in regulating growth, development, reproduction, energy balance, and metabolism. Altering the function of the endocrine system has negative health consequences. Furthermore, endocrine disruptors (EDC) have a significant impact on the endocrine system, causing the abnormal functioning of hormones and their receptors, resulting in various diseases and disorders. Overall, this review focuses on the impact of epigenetics on the endocrine system and its interaction with metabolism."

The telomere system, vital to chromosomal integrity and cellular viability, is prone to oxidative damages contributing to the severity of high-altitude disorders such as high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE). However, at the same time, it is suggested to sustain physical performance. This case-control study, comprising 210 HAPE-free (HAPE-f) sojourners, 183 HAPE-patients (HAPE-p) and 200 healthy highland natives (HLs) residing at ~3500 m, investigated telomere length, telomerase activity, and oxidative stress biomarkers. Fluidigm SNP genotyping screened 65 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 11 telomere-maintaining genes. Significance was attained atp≤ 0.05 after adjusting for confounders and correction for multiple comparisons. Shorter telomere length, decreased telomerase activity and increased oxidative stress were observed in HAPE patients; contrarily, longer telomere length and elevated telomerase activity were observed in healthy HA natives compared to HAPE-f. Four SNPs and three haplotypes are associated with HAPE, whereas eight SNPs and nine haplotypes are associated with HA adaptation. Various gene-gene interactions and correlations between/among clinical parameters and biomarkers suggested the presence of a complex interplay underlining HAPE and HA adaptation physiology. A distinctive contribution of the telomere-telomerase system contributing to HA physiology is evident in this study. A normal telomere system may be advantageous in endurance training."

Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, might mirror alterations in biological processes that are influenced by NS work.The present study was conducted on 94 healthy female workers with different working schedules and aimed at identifying whether NS was associated with plasmatic concentrations of the inflammatory proteins NLRP3 and TNF-alpha, as well as with DNA methylation levels of ten human endogenous retroviral (HERV) sequences, and nine genes selected for their role in immune and inflammatory processes. We also explored the possible role of the body mass index (BMI) as an additional susceptibility factor that might influence the effects of NS work on the tested epigenetic modifications.We observed a positive association between NS and NLRP3 levels (p-value 0.0379). Moreover, NS workers retained different methylation levels forERVFRD-1(p-value = 0.0274),HERV-L(p-value = 0.0377), andHERV-P(p-value = 0.0140) elements, and forBIRC2(p-value = 0.0460),FLRT3(p-value = 0.0422),MIG6(p-value = 0.0085), andSIRT1(p-value = 0.0497) genes. We also observed that the BMI modified the relationship between NS and the methylation ofERVE, HERV-L, andERVW-1elements. Overall, our results suggest that HERV methylation could pose as a promising biomolecular sensor to monitor not only the effect of NS work but also the cumulative effect of multiple stressors.Copyright © 2023 Ferrari, Monti, Favero, Carugno, Tarantini, Maggioni, Bonzini, Pesatori and Bollati."

Breast cancer is the most prevalent malignant tumor seen in women in developing nations. At present, there is no effective method to inhibit brain metastasis of breast cancer. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct a systematic study on BMS of breast cancer, which will not provide ideas and sites for follow-up studies on the treatment and inhibition of BMS.In this study, data set GSE43837 was screened from gene expression omnibus database, and then R language tool was used for differential analysis of its expression spectrum, The gene ontology functional enrichment and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes signal pathway enrichment analyses, as well as the interactive gene retrieval tool for hub-gene analysis, were performed.According to the findings, the primary genes linked to breast cancer brain metastases are those that involve interactions between cytokines and their respective receptors and between neuroactive ligands and their respective receptors. The majority of the gene ontology enrichment took place in the extracellular structural tissues, the extracellular matrix tissues, and the second message-mediated signaling. We were able to identify 8 genes that are linked to breast cancer spreading to the brain. The gene score for matrix metallopeptidase1 (MMP-1) was the highest among them, and the genes MMP10, tumor necrosis factor alpha-inducible protein 8, collagen type I alpha 2 chain, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, and TNF superfamily member 11 were all connected to 1 another in an interaction way.There is a possibility that the 8 key genes that were identified in this research are connected to the progression of BMS in breast cancer.

An unhealthy lifestyle may play an important role in the pathway from childhood adversity to frailty. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the association of childhood adversity with frailty, and the mediating role of unhealthy lifestyle in the association.This lifespan analysis included 152914 adults aged 40-69 years old from the UK Biobank. We measured childhood adversity with five items: physical neglect, emotional neglect, sexual abuse, physical abuse, and emotional abuse through online mental health survey. Frailty was measured by the frailty index; an unhealthy lifestyle score (range: 0-5) was calculated based on unhealthy body mass index, smoking, drinking, physical inactivity, and unhealthy diet at the baseline survey. Multiple logistic regression and mediation analysis were performed.A total of 10078 participants (6.6%) were defined as having frailty. Participants with any childhood adversity had higher odds of frailty. For example, in the fully adjusted model, with a one-point increase in cumulative score of childhood adversity, the odds of frailty increased by 41% (Odds Ratio: 1.41; 95% Confidence Interval: 1.39, 1.44). Unhealthy lifestyle partially mediated the associations of childhood adversity with frailty (mediation proportion: 4.4%-7.0%). The mediation proportions were largest for physical (8.2%) and sexual (8.1%) abuse.Among this large sample, childhood adversity was positively associated with frailty, and unhealthy lifestyle partially mediated the association. This newly identified pathway highlights the potential of lifestyle intervention strategies among those who experienced childhood adversity (in particular, physical and sexual abuse) to promote healthy aging."

To further enhance the lodging resistance of high-yielding rice varieties amidst climate change, it is necessary to not only shorten culms but strengthen them as well. A landrace rice variety, Omachi, which was established more than 100 years ago, has the largest culm diameter and bending moment at breaking in the basal internodes among 135 temperate japonica accessions. Using unused alleles in such a landrace is an effective way to strengthen the culm. In this study, we performed quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis to identify the genetic factors of culm strength of Omachi using recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between Omachi and Koshihikari, a standard variety in Japan. We identified three QTLs for the culm diameter of the 5th internode on chromosomes 3 (qCD3) and 7 (qCD7-1, qCD7-2). Among them, qCD7-2 was verified by QTL analysis using the F2population derived from a cross between one of the RILs and Koshihikari. RNA-seq analysis of shoot apex raised 10 candidate genes underlying the region of qCD7-2. The increase in culm strength by accumulating Omachi alleles of qCD3, qCD7-1 and qCD7-2 was 25.0% in 2020. These QTLs for culm diameter pleiotropically increased spikelet number per panicle but did not affect days to heading or culm length. These results suggest that the Omachi alleles of qCD3, qCD7-1 and qCD7-2 are useful for breeding to increase lodging resistance and yield.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Few CHD associated CNVs could be interpreted as dosage effect due to disruption of coding sequences. Emerging evidences have highlighted the regulatory roles of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in cardiac development. Whereas it remains unexplored whether lncRNAs within CNVs (CNV-lncRNAs) could contribute to the etiology of CHD associated CNVs. Here we constructed coexpression networks involving CNV-lncRNAs within CHD associated CNVs and protein coding genes using the human organ developmental transcriptomic data, and showed that CNV-lncRNAs within 10 of the non-syndromic CHD associated CNVs clustered in the most significant heart correlated module, and had highly correlated coexpression with multiple key CHD genes. HSALNG0104472 within 15q11.2 region was identified as a hub CNV-lncRNA with heart-biased expression and validated experimentally. Our results indicated that HSALNG0104472 should be a main effector responsible for cardiac defects of 15q11.2 deletion through regulating cardiomyocytes differentiation. Our findings suggested that CNV-lncRNAs could potentially contribute to the pathologies of a maximum proportion of 68.4% (13/19) of non-syndromic CHD associated CNVs.

We deleted the conserved mouse orthologues of two independent AF-associated genomic regions in theTbx5locus, one intronic (RE(int)) and one downstream (RE(down)) ofTbx5. In both lines, we observed a modest (30%) increase ofTbx5in the postnatal atria. To gain insight into the effects of slight dosage increase in vivo, we investigated the atrial transcriptional, epigenetic and electrophysiological properties of both lines. Increased atrialTbx5expression was associated with induction of genes involved in development, ion transport and conduction, with increased susceptibility to atrial arrhythmias, and increased action potential duration of atrial cardiomyocytes. We identified an AF-associated variant in the human RE(int) that increases its transcriptional activity. Expression of the AF-associated transcription factorPrrx1was induced inTbx5RE(int)KOcardiomyocytes. We found that some of the transcriptional and functional changes in the atria caused by increasedTbx5expression were normalized when reducing cardiacPrrx1expression inTbx5RE(int)KOmice, indicating an interaction between these two AF genes. We conclude that modest increases in expression of dose-dependent transcription factors, caused by common regulatory variants, significantly impact on the cardiac gene regulatory network and disease susceptibility.© 2023, Bosada et al."

"36763605","Learning high-order interactions for polygenic risk prediction.","PLoS One","Within the framework of precision medicine, the stratification of individual genetic susceptibility based on inherited DNA variation has paramount relevance. However, one of the most relevant pitfalls of traditional Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) approaches is their inability to model complex high-order non-linear SNP-SNP interactions and their effect on the phenotype (e.g. epistasis). Indeed, they incur in a computational challenge as the number of possible interactions grows exponentially with the number of SNPs considered, affecting the statistical reliability of the model parameters as well. In this work, we address this issue by proposing a novel PRS approach, called High-order Interactions-aware Polygenic Risk Score (hiPRS), that incorporates high-order interactions in modeling polygenic risk. The latter combines an interaction search routine based on frequent itemsets mining and a novel interaction selection algorithm based on Mutual Information, to construct a simple and interpretable weighted model of user-specified dimensionality that can predict a given binary phenotype. Compared to traditional PRSs methods, hiPRS does not rely on GWAS summary statistics nor any external information. Moreover, hiPRS differs from Machine Learning-based approaches that can include complex interactions in that it provides a readable and interpretable model and it is able to control overfitting, even on small samples. In the present work we demonstrate through a comprehensive simulation study the superior performance of hiPRS w.r.t. state of the art methods, both in terms of scoring performance and interpretability of the resulting model. We also test hiPRS against small sample size, class imbalance and the presence of noise, showcasing its robustness to extreme experimental settings. Finally, we apply hiPRS to a case study on real data from DACHS cohort, defining an interaction-aware scoring model to predict mortality of stage II-III Colon-Rectal Cancer patients treated with oxaliplatin.Copyright: © 2023 Massi et al.

The databases MEDLINE, Cochrane Library and Dimensions were searched to find studies evaluating whether waterpipe smokers exhibited any cytotoxic or genotoxic effects on their oral cells compared to non-smokers, with regard to mouth neoplasms. Particularly, changes in DNA methylation and p53 expression were assessed. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were adopted for the systematic review. Review Manager was utilised for statistical analysis with a significance level atP<0.05. To assess the grades of the included articles, a risk of bias analysis was summarised. A forest plot, including some of the included articles included, was created regarding the different grades. A total of 20 studies were included in this review. The results showed that waterpipe smoking has cytotoxic and genotoxic effects on oral cells, with a risk difference of 0.16. Although the published articles are few in number, all confirm the devastating effects of waterpipe smoking related to the carcinogenicity. Waterpipe smoking is harmful to oral health. It causes a series of detrimental cellular and genetic modifications such as acanthosis, epithelial dysplasia and hyperparakeratosis. In addition, waterpipe smoke contains several carcinogenic compounds.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the value of using pulse wave analysis (PWA) to measure arterial stiffness as a sign of vascular wall impairment in obese children. The research was focused on 60 subjects: 33 obese and 27 normal-weight. Ages ranged from 6 to 18 years old. PWA includes parameters such as pulse wave velocity (PWV), augmentation index (AIx), peripheral and central blood pressure (SBP, DBP, cSBP, cDBP), heart rate, and central pulse pressure (cPP). The device used was a Mobil-O-Graph. Blood parameters were taken from the subject's medical history, not older than 6 months. A high BMI and a large waist circumference are linked to a high PWV. The levels of LDL-c, triglycerides (TG), non-HDL-c, TG/HDL-c ratio, and total cholesterol-HDL-c ratio significantly correlate to PWV, SBP, and cSBP. Alanine aminotransferase is a reliable predictor of PWV, AIx, SBP, DBP, and cDBP, while aspartate aminotransferase is a significant predictor of AIx, mean arterial pressure (MAP), cSBP, and cPP. 25-OH-Vitamin D negatively correlates with PWV, SBP, and MAP and significantly predicts the MAP. Cortisol and TSH levels are not significant to arterial stiffness in obese children without specific comorbidities and neither is fasting glucose in obese children without impaired glucose tolerance. We conclude that PWA contributes valuable data regarding patients' vascular health and should be considered a reliable tool in the management of obese children."

We conducted a meta-analysis of relevant longitudinal epidemiological studies to evaluate the phenotypic link. To identify genetic links, we performed genetic correlation analysis and pleiotropy analysis of genome-wide association study summary statistics datasets of POAG, intraocular pressure (IOP), vertical cup-to-disc ratio, obesity, body mass index (BMI), and waist-to-hip ratio. In the meta-analysis, we first established that obese and underweight populations have a significantly higher risk of POAG using longitudinal data. We also discovered positive genetic correlations between POAG and BMI and obesity phenotypes. Finally, we identified over 20 genomic loci jointly associated with POAG/IOP and BMI. Among them, the genes lociCADM2,RP3-335N17.2,RP11-793K1.1,RPS17P5, andCASC20showed the lowest false discovery rate. These findings support the connection between body fat phenotypes and POAG. The newly identified genomic loci and genes render further functional investigation."
"36833951","Socioeconomic, Behavioural, and Social Health Correlates of Optimism and Pessimism in Older Men and Women: A Cross-Sectional Study.","Int J Environ Res Public Health","Optimism is a disposition characterised by positive future expectancies, while pessimism is characterised by expecting the worst. High optimism and low pessimism promote the health of older adults and may potentiate full engagement in life. We identified socioeconomic, behavioural, and social factors associated with optimism and pessimism in older adults.Participants included 10,146 community-dwelling, apparently healthy Australian adults aged 70 years and over from the ASPREE Longitudinal Study of Older Persons (ALSOP). Optimism and pessimism were measured using the revised Life Orientation Test. Cross-sectional ordinal logistic regression was used to determine the socioeconomic, behavioural, and social health factors associated with optimism and pessimism.Higher education, greater physical activity, lower loneliness, and volunteering were associated with higher optimism and lower pessimism. Low social support was associated with higher pessimism. Higher socioeconomic advantage, greater income, and living alone were associated with lower pessimism. Women were more optimistic and less pessimistic than men. The association of age, smoking status, and alcohol consumption with optimism and pessimism differed for men and women.Factors associated with higher optimism and lower pessimism were also those demonstrated to support healthy ageing. Health-promotion action at the individual level (e.g., smoking cessation or regular physical activity), health professional level (e.g., social prescribing or improving access and quality of care for all older adults), and community level (e.g., opportunities for volunteer work or low-cost social activities for older adults) may improve optimism and reduce pessimism, possibly also promoting healthy ageing."

This meta-analysis is the first to synthesize published results and evaluate the application value of circulating cfDNA in the diagnosis of TC.A search strategy was developed according to PICO (P: Patient; I: Intervention; C: Comparison; O: Outcome) principles. We searched 5 databases until October 2022. Original studies that examined cfDNA for the diagnosis of TC and used pathology as the gold standard were included in this meta-analysis. A random-effects model was used to pool the data extracted from individual studies, including the number of patients and the numbers of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.A total of 622 patients with TC, 547 patients with benign thyroid nodules, and 98 healthy individuals were included in 20 studies reported in 14 articles. The types of cfDNA included in the research include specific mutations of cfDNA, methylation of cfDNA, the content of cfDNA, and cfDNA index. After rigorous statistical analysis, the pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, diagnostic odds ratio, and area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve were 0.76 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.62-0.85), 0.87 (95% CI 0.78-0.93), 5.08 (95% CI 3.3-10.3), 0.28 (95% CI 0.17-0.46), 21 (95% CI 9-49), and 0.89 (95% CI 0.86-0.91), respectively. The meta-regression results showed that the number of cfDNAs, cfDNA methylation status, and sample size were the sources of heterogeneity in the specificity of the study. A subgroup analysis showed that the quantitative analysis group (cfDNA level) had a higher diagnostic accuracy than that of the qualitative analysis group (cfDNA methylation, mutation, or integrity index), with a sensitivity of 0.84, specificity of 0.89, and area under the curve of 0.91.The results of this meta-analysis suggest that cfDNA has value as an adjunct for the diagnosis of TC. Quantitative detection of cfDNA can achieve relatively high diagnostic accuracy. However, due to heterogeneity, the test results based on cfDNA for TC should be interpreted with caution.Copyright © 2023 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc."
"36820942","Transcriptomic analysis predicts the risk of progression of premalignant lesions in human tongue.","Discov Oncol","The 5-year survival rate for patients with oral squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), including tongue SCC, has not significantly improved over the last several decades. Oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMD), including oral dysplasias, are oral epithelial disorders that can develop into oral SCCs. To identify molecular characteristics that might predict conversion of OPMDs to SCCs and guide treatment plans, we performed global transcriptomic analysis of human tongue OPMD (n = 9) and tongue SCC (n = 11) samples with paired normal margin tissue from patients treated at Weill Cornell Medicine. Compared to margin tissue, SCCs showed more transcript changes than OPMDs. OPMDs and SCCs shared some altered transcripts, but these changes were generally greater in SCCs than OPMDs. Both OPMDs and SCCs showed altered signaling pathways related to cell migration, basement membrane disruption, and metastasis. We suggest that OPMDs are on the path toward malignant transformation. Based on patterns of gene expression, both OPMD and tongue SCC samples can be categorized into subclasses (mesenchymal, classical, basal, and atypical) similar to those seen in human head and neck SCC (HNSCC). These subclasses of OPMDs have the potential to be used to stratify patient prognoses and therapeutic options for tongue OPMDs. Lastly, we identified a gene set (ELF5; RPTN; IGSF10; CRMP1; HTR3A) whose transcript changes have the power to classify OPMDs and SCCs and developed a Firth logistic regression model using the changes in these transcripts relative to paired normal tissue to validate pathological diagnosis and potentially predict the likelihood of an OPMD developing into SCC, as data sets become available.© 2023.

"36830021","Microbiome Changes in Pregnancy Disorders.","Antioxidants (Basel)","The human microbiota comprises all microorganisms, such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses, found within a specific environment that live on our bodies and inside us. The last few years have witnessed an explosion of information related to the role of microbiota changes in health and disease. Even though the gut microbiota is considered the most important in maintaining our health, other regions of the human body, such as the oral cavity, lungs, vagina, and skin, possess their own microbiota. Recent work suggests a correlation between the microbiota present during pregnancy and pregnancy complications. The aim of our literature review was to provide a broad overview of this growing and important topic. We focused on the most significant changes in the microbiota in the four more common obstetric diseases affecting women's health. Thus, our attention will be focused on hypertensive disorders, gestational diabetes mellitus, preterm birth, and recurrent miscarriage. Pregnancy is a unique period in a woman's life since the body undergoes different adaptations to provide an optimal environment for fetal growth. Such changes also involve all the microorganisms, which vary in composition and quantity during the three trimesters of gestation. In addition, special attention will be devoted to the potential and fundamental advances in developing clinical applications to prevent and treat those disorders by modulating the microbiota to develop personalized therapies for disease prevention and tailored treatments."
"36817590","Dieting reverses histone methylation and hypothalamic AgRP regulation in obese rats.","Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)","Although dieting is a key factor in improving physiological functions associated with obesity, the role by which histone methylation modulates satiety/hunger regulation of the hypothalamus through weight loss remains largely elusive. Canonically, H3K9me2 is a transcriptional repressive post-translational epigenetic modification that is involved in obesity, however, its role in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) has not been thoroughly explored. Here we explore the role that KDM4D, a specific demethylase of residue H3K9, plays in energy balance by directly modulating the expression of AgRP, a key neuropeptide that regulates hunger response.We used a rodent model of diet-induced obesity (DIO) to assess whether histone methylation malprogramming impairs energy balance control and how caloric restriction may reverse this phenotype. Using ChIP-qPCR, we assessed the repressive modification of H3K9me2 at the site of AgRP. To elucidate the functional role of KDM4D in reversing obesity via dieting, a pharmacological agent, JIB-04 was used to inhibit the action of KDM4Din vivo.In DIO, downregulation ofKdm4dmRNA results in both enrichment of H3K9me2 on the AgRP promoter and transcriptional repression of AgRP. Because epigenetic modifications are dynamic, it is possible for some of these modifications to be reversed when external cues are altered. The reversal phenomenon was observed in calorically restricted rats, in which upregulation ofKdm4dmRNA resulted in demethylation of H3K9 on theAgRPpromoter and transcriptional increase of AgRP. In order to verify that KDM4D is necessary to reverse obesity by dieting, we demonstrated thatin vivoinhibition of KDM4D activity by pharmacological agent JIB-04 in naïve rats resulted in transcriptional repression of AgRP, decreasing orexigenic signaling, thus inhibiting hunger.We propose that the action of KDM4D through the demethylation of H3K9 is critical in maintaining a stable epigenetic landscape of the AgRP promoter, and may offer a target to develop new treatments for obesity.Copyright © 2023 Rapps, Kisliouk, Marco, Weller and Meiri."

While methods to analyze data from single cell high throughput chromatin conformation capture (scHi-C) experiments are maturing, methods that can jointly analyze multiple single cell modalities with scHi-C data are lacking. Here, we introduce Muscle, a semi-nonnegative joint decomposition ofMultiplesinglecelltensors, to jointly analyze 3D conformation and DNA methylation data at the single cell level. Muscle takes advantage of the inherent tensor structure of the scHi-C data, and integrates this modality with DNA methylation. We developed an alternating least squares algorithm for estimating Muscle parameters and established its optimality properties. Parameters estimated by Muscle directly align with the key components of the downstream analysis of scHi-C data in a cell type specific manner. Evaluations with data-driven experiments and simulations demonstrate the advantages of the joint modeling framework of Muscle over single modality modeling or a baseline multi modality modeling for cell type delineation and elucidating associations between modalities.

The DEGs were subjected to enrichment analysis, and two machine learning algorithms were used to identify candidate genes associated with IPF. These genes were verified in a validation cohort from the GEO database. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted to assess the predictive value of the IPF-associated genes. The cell-type identification by estimating relative subsets of RNA transcripts (CIBERSORT) algorithm was used to evaluate the proportion of immune cells in IPF and normal tissues. Additionally, the correlation between the expression of IPF-associated genes and the infiltration levels of immune cells was examined.A total of 302 upregulated and 192 downregulated genes were identified. Functional annotation, pathway enrichment, Disease Ontology and gene set enrichment analyses revealed that the DEGs were related to the extracellular matrix and immune responses. COL3A1, CDH3, CEBPD, and GPIHBP1 were identified as candidate biomarkers using machine learning algorithms, and their predictive value was verified in a validation cohort. Additionally, ROC analysis revealed that the four genes had high predictive accuracy. The infiltration levels of plasma cells, M0 macrophages and resting dendritic cells were higher and those of resting natural killer (NK) cells, M1 macrophages and eosinophils were lower in the lung tissues of patients with IPF than in those of healthy individuals. The expression of the abovementioned genes was correlated with the infiltration levels of plasma cells, M0 macrophages and eosinophils.COL3A1, CDH3, CEBPD, and GPIHBP1 are candidate biomarkers of IPF.

However, the specific biomarkers and precise mechanisms of this disease are not fully understood, which can delay the best treatment time, hence, this study aimed to detect the potential biomarkers and pathophysiological process of KD through bioinformatic analysis.The Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO) was the source of the RNA sequencing data from KD patients. Differential expressed genes (DEGs) were screened between KD patients and healthy controls (HCs) with the ""limma"" R package. Weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to discover the most corresponding module and hub genes of KD. The node genes were obtained by the combination of the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model with the top 5 genes from five algorithms in CytoHubba, which were further validated with the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve). CIBERSORTx was employed to discover the constitution of immune cells in KDs and HCs. Functional enrichment analysis was performed to understand the biological implications of the modular genes. Finally, competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNA) networks of node genes were predicted using online databases.A total of 267 DEGs were analyzed between 153 KD patients and 92 HCs in the training set, spanning two modules according to WGCNA. The turquoise module was identified as the hub module, which was mainly enriched in cell activation involved in immune response, myeloid leukocyte activation, myeloid leukocyte mediated immunity, secretion and leukocyte mediated immunity biological processes; included type II diabetes mellitus, nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism, O-glycan biosynthesis, glycerolipid and glutathione metabolism pathways. The node genes included ADM, ALPL, HK3, MMP9 and S100A12, and there was good performance in the validation studies. Immune cell infiltration analysis revealed that gamma delta T cells, monocytes, M0 macrophage, activated dendritic cells, activated mast cells and neutrophils were elevated in KD patients. Regarding the ceRNA networks, three intact networks were constructed: NEAT1/NORAD/XIST-hsa-miR-524-5p-ADM, NEAT1/NORAD/XIST-hsa-miR-204-5p-ALPL, NEAT1/NORAD/XIST-hsa-miR-524-5p/hsa-miR-204-5p-MMP9.To conclude, the five-gene signature and three ceRNA networks constructed in our study are of great value in the early diagnosis of KD and might help to elucidate our understanding of KD at the RNA regulatory level.© 2023.

Neurotrophic factors are key factors associated with the progression of degenerative neuropathies and gliomas.The 2601 neurotrophic factor-related genes (NFRGs) available in the Genecards portal were analyzed and 12 NFRGs with potential roles in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease and the prognosis of GBM were identified. LASSO regression and random forest algorithms were then used to screen the key NFRGs. The correlation of the key NFRGs with immune pathways was verified using GSEA (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis). A prognostic risk scoring system was constructed using LASSO (Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) and multivariate Cox risk regression based on the expression of the 12 NFRGs in the GBM cohort from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. We also investigated differences in clinical characteristics, mutational landscape, immune cell infiltration, and predicted efficacy of immunotherapy between risk groups. Finally, the accuracy of the model genes was validated using multi-omics mutation analysis, single-cell sequencing, QT-PCR, and HPA.We found that 4 NFRGs were more reliable for the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease through the use of machine learning techniques. These results were validated using two external cohorts. We also identified 7 NFRGs that were highly associated with the prognosis and diagnosis of GBM. Patients in the low-risk group had a greater overall survival (OS) than those in the high-risk group. The nomogram generated based on clinical characteristics and risk scores showed strong prognostic prediction ability. The NFRG signature was an independent prognostic predictor for GBM. The low-risk group was more likely to benefit from immunotherapy based on the degree of immune cell infiltration, expression of immune checkpoints (ICs), and predicted response to immunotherapy. In the end, 2 NFRGs (EN1 and LOXL1) were identified as crucial for the development of Parkinson's disease and the outcome of GBM.Our study revealed that 4 NFRGs are involved in the progression of PD. The 7-NFRGs risk score model can predict the prognosis of GBM patients and help clinicians to classify the GBM patients into high and low risk groups. EN1, and LOXL1 can be used as therapeutic targets for personalized immunotherapy for patients with PD and GBM.Copyright © 2023 Zhao, Chi, Yang, Chen, Wu, Lai, Xu, Su, Luo, Peng, Xia, Cheng and Lu."

The aims of this study were to identify potential prognostic biomarkers and to construct a predictive model related to PRGs.Sequencing and clinical data were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) was performed to identify molecular subtype screening. LASSO regression was used to screen for prognostic markers, and then a risk score model was constructed. The Maxstat package was utilized to calculate the optimal cutoff value, according to which patients were divided into a high-risk group and a low-risk group, and the survival curves were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier (K-M) method. Nomograms and calibration curves were established using the rms package.A total of 33 PRGs were extracted from the TCGA database underlying which 4 MM molecular subtypes were defined. Patients in cluster 1 had poorer survival than those in cluster 2 (p = 0.035). A total of 9 PRGs were screened out as prognostic markers, and the predictive ability of the 9-gene risk score for 3-year survival was best (AUC = 0.658). Patients in the high-risk group had worse survival than those in the low-risk group (p < 0.001), which was consistent with the results verified by the GSE2658 dataset. The nomogram constructed by gender, age, International Staging System (ISS) stage, and risk score had the best prognostic predictive performance with a c-index of 0.721.Our model could enhance the predictive ability of ISS staging and give a reference for clinical decision-making.

Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) further screened immune genes with prognosis values, and tumor immune score was calculated for patients with cholangiocarcinoma after the combination of the three datasets. Kaplan-Meier curve analysis determined the optimal cut-off value, which was applied for dividing cholangiocarcinoma patients into low and high immune score group. To explore the differences in tumor microenvironment and immunotherapy between immune cell-related subtypes and immune score groups of cholangiocarcinoma.34 prognostic immune genes and three immunocell-related subtypes with statistically significant prognosis (IC1, IC2 and IC3) were identified. Among them, IC1 and IC3 showed higher immune cell infiltration, and IC3 may be more suitable for immunotherapy and chemotherapy. 10 immune genes with prognostic significance were screened by LASSO regression analysis, and a tumor immune score model was constructed. Kaplan-Meier (KM) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that RiskScore had excellent prognostic prediction ability. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that 6 gene (NLRX1, AKT1, CSRP1, LEP, MUC4 and SEMA4B) of 10 genes were abnormal expressions between cancer and paracancer tissue.

Intrinsic molecular mechanisms in CD, however, remain poorly understood. The identification of novel biomarkers in CD cases based on larger samples through machine learning approaches may inform the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. A comprehensive analysis was conducted on all CD datasets of Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO); our team then used the robust rank aggregation (RRA) method to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between controls and CD patients. PPI (protein‒protein interaction) network and functional enrichment analyses were performed to investigate the potential functions of the DEGs, with molecular complex detection (MCODE) identifying some important functional modules from the PPI network. Three machine learning algorithms, support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE), random forest (RF), and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), were applied to determine characteristic genes, which were verified by ROC curve analysis and immunohistochemistry (IHC) using clinical samples. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression were used to establish a machine learning score for diagnosis. Single-sample GSEA (ssGSEA) was performed to examine the correlation between immune infiltration and biomarkers. In total, 5 datasets met the inclusion criteria: GSE75214, GSE95095, GSE126124, GSE179285, and GSE186582. Based on RRA integrated analysis, 203 significant DEGs were identified (120 upregulated genes and 83 downregulated genes), and MCODE revealed some important functional modules in the PPI network. Machine learning identified LCN2, REG1A, AQP9, CCL2, GIP, PROK2, DEFA5, CXCL9, and NAMPT; AQP9, PROK2, LCN2, and NAMPT were further verified by ROC curves and IHC in the external cohort. The final machine learning score was defined as [Expression level of AQP9 × (2.644)] + [Expression level of LCN2 × (0.958)] + [Expression level of NAMPT × (1.115)]. ssGSEA showed markedly elevated levels of dendritic cells and innate immune cells, such as macrophages and NK cells, in CD, consistent with the gene enrichment results that the DEGs are mainly involved in the IL-17 signaling pathway and humoral immune response. The selected biomarkers analyzed by the RRA method and machine learning are highly reliable. These findings improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of CD pathogenesis.© 2023.

Cuproptosis, a new way induces cell death, has attracted worldwide attention. However, the relationship between cuproptosis and LGG remains unknown. Our study is all about finding out if there are any genes related to coproptosis that can be used to predict the outcome of LGG.RNA data and clinical information were selected from Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), 5 lncRNAs (GAS5.AS1, MYLK.AS1, AC142472.1, AC011346.1, AL359643.3) were identified by Cox univariate and multivariate regression, as well as LASSO Cox regression. In the training and test sets, a dual validation of the predictive signature comprised of these 5 lncRNAs was undertaken. The findings demonstrate that the risk model is able to predict the survival regression of LGG patients and has a good performance in either the KM curve approach or the ROC curve. GO, GSEA and KEGG were carried out to explore the possible molecular processes that affecting the prognosis of LGG. The characteristics of immune microenvironment were investigated by using CIBERSORT, ESTIMATE and ssGSEA.We identified five lncRNAs related with cuproptosis that were closely associated with the prognosis of LGG and used these five lncRNAs to develop a risk model. Using this risk model, LGG patients were then divided into high-risk and low-risk groups. The two patient groups had significantly distinct survival characteristics. Analyses of Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) revealed that the differential genes of the two patient groups were primarily concentrated in neural active ligand-receptor interaction and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction. The ssGSEA score determined the information related to immune infiltration, and the two groups were differentially expressed in immune subpopulations such as T cells and B cells as well.Our study discovered 5 cuproptosis-related lncRNAs which contribute to predicting patients' survival of LGG and provide ideas for the exploration of new targets for LGG in the future.Copyright © 2023 Wen, Zhao and Shu."

GO and KEGG analysis indicated that several enrichment terms were associated with changes in autophagy. Three genes (MFN1,ULK1andPARK2) were finally determined as potential hub genes by three algorithms. In the training set, the AUROC ofMFN1,ULK1andPARK2were 0.839, 0.906 and 0.842. However, the results of the validation set demonstrated thatMFN1andPARK2had no significant difference in distinguishing DN samples from healthy controls, while the AUROC ofULK1was 0.894. Immune infiltration analysis using CIBERSORT showed thatULK1was positively related to neutrophils, whereas negatively related to M1 and M2 macrophages. Finally,ULK1was positively correlated with GFR in Nephroseq database.ULK1is a potential biomarker for DN and may influence the development of diabetic nephropathy by regulating mitophagy.Copyright © 2023 Yang, Gao, Mao, Liu, Liu and Wu."
"36713077","Cuproptosis-related LncRNAs signature as biomarker of prognosis and immune infiltration in pancreatic cancer.","Front Genet","Background:Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a malignant gastrointestinal tumor with a terrible prognosis. Cuproptosis is a recently discovered form of cell death. This study is intended to explore the relationship between cuproptosis-related lncRNAs (CRLncs) signature with the prognosis and the tumor microenvironment (TME) of PC.Methods:Transcript sequencing data of PC samples with clinical information were obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Univariate Cox regression analysis and LASSO regression analysis were employed to construct the prognostic signature based on CRLncs associated with PC survival. A nomogram was created according to this signature, and the signaling pathway enrichment was analyzed. Subsequently, we explored the link between this prognostic signature with the mutational landscape and TME. Eventually, drug sensitivity was predicted based on this signature.Results:Forty-six of 159 CRLncs were most significantly relevant to the prognosis of PC, and a 6-lncRNA prognostic signature was established. The expression level of signature lncRNAs were detected in PC cell lines. The AUC value of the ROC curve for this risk score predicting 5-year survival in PC was .944, which was an independent prognostic factor for PC. The risk score was tightly related to the mutational pattern of PC, especially the driver genes of PC. Single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) demonstrated a significant correlation between signature with the TME of PC. Ultimately, compounds were measured for therapy in high-risk and low-risk PC patients, respectively.Conclusion:A prognostic signature of CRLncs for PC was established in the current study, which may serve as a promising marker for the outcomes of PC patients and has important forecasting roles for gene mutations, immune cell infiltration, and drug sensitivity in PC.Copyright © 2023 Chen, Yu, Zhou, Chen, Li and Tan."

Ongoing large-scale efforts to process and normalize publicly available gene expression data enable rapid and systematic reanalysis. While several powerful tools systematically process RNA-seq data, enabling their reanalysis, few resources systematically recompute differentially expressed genes (DEGs) generated from individual studies. We developed a robust differential expression analysis pipeline to recompute 3162 human DEG lists from The Cancer Genome Atlas, Genotype-Tissue Expression Consortium, and 142 studies within the Sequence Read Archive. After measuring the accuracy of the recomputed DEG lists, we built the Differential Expression Enrichment Tool (DEET), which enables users to interact with the recomputed DEG lists. DEET, available through CRAN and RShiny, systematically queries which of the recomputed DEG lists share similar genes, pathways, and TF targets to their own gene lists. DEET identifies relevant studies based on shared results with the user's gene lists, aiding in hypothesis generation and data-driven literature review.© The Author(s) 2023.

"36685882","Prognostic prediction of clear cell renal cell carcinoma based on lipid metabolism-related lncRNA risk coefficient model.","Front Genet","Objective:In order to predict the prognosis in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) so as to understand cancer lipid metabolism and sensitivity to immune-targeting drugs, model algorithms were used to establish a risk coefficient model of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) associated with lipid metabolism.Methods:The transcriptome data were retrieved from TCGA, and lncRNAs associated with lipid metabolism were obtained through Pearson correlation and differential expression analyses. Differentially expressed lipid metabolism-related lncRNAs and lipid metabolism-related lncRNA pairs were obtained using the R language software. The minimum absolute shrinkage method and the selector operation regression method were used to construct the model and draw the receiver operator characteristic curve. High-risk patients were differentiated from low-risk patients through the cut-off value, and the correlation analyses of the high-risk subgroup and low-risk subgroup were performed.Results:This research discovered that 25 pairs of lncRNAs were associated with the lipid metabolism of ccRCC, and 12 of these pairs were utilized to build the model. In combination with clinical data, the areas under the 1-, 3- and 5-year survival curves of ccRCC patients were 0.809, 0.764 and 0.792, separately. The cut-off value was used to perform subgroup analysis. The results showed that high-risk patients had poor prognosis. The results of Cox multivariate regressive analyses revealed that age and risk score were independent prediction factors of ccRCC prognosis. In addition, immune cell infiltration, the levels of gene expression at immune checkpoints, and high-risk patients more susceptible to sunitinib-targeted treatment were assessed by the risk model.Conclusion:Our team identified new prognostic markers of ccRCC and established risk models that could assess the prognosis of ccRCC patients and help determine which type of patients were more susceptible to sunitinib.

This analysis included 410 offspring of the Early Life Exposure in Mexico to Environmental Toxicants (ELEMENT) birth cohort followed up to two time points in late childhood/adolescence. At Time 1, DNAm was quantified in blood leukocytes at long interspersed nuclear elements (LINE-1),H19, and 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11β-HSD-2), and at Time 2 in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α). At each time point, cardiometabolic risk factors were assessed including lipid profiles, glucose, blood pressure, and anthropometry. Linear mixed effects models were used for LINE-1,H19, and11β-HSD-2to account for the repeated-measure outcomes. Linear regression models were conducted for the cross-sectional association betweenPPAR-αwith the outcomes. DNAm at LINE-1 was associated with log glucose at site 1 [β = -0.029,p= 0.0006] and with log high-density lipoprotein cholesterol at site 3 [β = 0.063,p= 0.0072].11β-HSD-2DNAm at site 4 was associated with log glucose (β = -0.018,p= 0.0018). DNAm at LINE-1 and11β-HSD-2was associated with few cardiometabolic risk factors among youth in a locus-specific manner.

Partial bladder outlet obstruction (pBOO) causes a massive burden to patients and finally leads to bladder fibrosis. Several cell types engage in the pBOO pathological process, including urothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts. To clarify the function of YAP in bladder fibrosis, we performed the RNA-seq and CUT&Tag of the bladder smooth muscle cell to analyze the YAP ablation of human bladder smooth muscle cells (hBdSMCs) and immunoprecipitation of YAP. 141 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified through RNA-seq between YAP-knockdown and nature control. After matching with the results of CUT&Tag, 36 genes were regulated directly by YAP. Then we identified the hub genes in the DEGs, including CDCA5, CENPA, DTL, NCAPH, and NEIL3, that contribute to cell proliferation. Thus, our study provides a regulatory network of YAP in smooth muscle proliferation. The possible effects of YAP on hBdSMC might be a vital target for pBOO-associated bladder fibrosis.Copyright © 2023 Di, Xiang and Jian."
"36699128","An epigenetic DNA methylation clock for age estimates in Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus).","Evol Appl","Knowledge of an animal's chronological age is crucial for understanding and predicting population demographics, survival and reproduction, but accurate age determination for many wild animals remains challenging. Previous methods to estimate age require invasive procedures, such as tooth extraction to analyse growth layers, which are difficult to carry out with large, mobile animals such as cetaceans. However, recent advances in epigenetic methods have opened new avenues for precise age determination. These 'epigenetic clocks' present a less invasive alternative and can provide age estimates with unprecedented accuracy. Here, we present a species-specific epigenetic clock based on skin tissue samples for a population of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) in Shark Bay, Western Australia. We measured methylation levels at 37,492 cytosine-guanine sites (CpG sites) in 165 samples using the mammalian methylation array. Chronological age estimates with an accuracy of ±1 year were available for 68 animals as part of a long-term behavioral study of this population. Using these samples with known age, we built an elastic net model with Leave-One-Out-Cross-Validation, which retained 43 CpG sites, providing anr = 0.86 and median absolute age error (MAE) = 2.1 years (5% of maximum age). This model was more accurate for our data than the previously published methylation clock based on skin samples of common bottlenose dolphins (T. truncatus:r = 0.83, MAE = 2.2) and the multi-species odontocete methylation clock (r = 0.68, MAE = 6.8), highlighting that species-specific clocks can have superior performance over those of multi-species assemblages. We further developed an epigenetic sex estimator, predicting sex with 100% accuracy. As age and sex are critical parameters for the study of animal populations, this clock and sex estimator will provide a useful tool for extracting life history information from skin samples rather than long-term observational data for free-ranging Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins worldwide.© 2022 The Authors.

"36855111","Epigenetics and stroke: role of DNA methylation and effect of aging on blood-brain barrier recovery.","Fluids Barriers CNS","Incomplete recovery of blood-brain barrier (BBB) function contributes to stroke outcomes. How the BBB recovers after stroke remains largely unknown. Emerging evidence suggests that epigenetic factors play a significant role in regulating post-stroke BBB recovery. This study aimed to evaluate the epigenetic and transcriptional profile of cerebral microvessels after thromboembolic (TE) stroke to define potential causes of limited BBB recovery. RNA-sequencing and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) analyses were performed using microvessels isolated from young (6 months) and old (18 months) mice seven days poststroke compared to age-matched sham controls. DNA methylation profiling of poststroke brain microvessels revealed 11,287 differentially methylated regions (DMR) in old and 9818 DMR in young mice, corresponding to annotated genes. These DMR were enriched in genes encoding cell structural proteins (e.g., cell junction, and cell polarity, actin cytoskeleton, extracellular matrix), transporters and channels (e.g., potassium transmembrane transporter, organic anion and inorganic cation transporters, calcium ion transport), and proteins involved in endothelial cell processes (e.g., angiogenesis/vasculogenesis, cell signaling and transcription regulation). Integrated analysis of methylation and RNA sequencing identified changes in cell junctions (occludin), actin remodeling (ezrin) as well as signaling pathways like Rho GTPase (RhoA and Cdc42ep4). Aging as a hub of aberrant methylation affected BBB recovery processes by profound alterations (hypermethylation and repression) in structural protein expression (e.g., claudin-5) as well as activation of a set of genes involved in endothelial to mesenchymal transformation (e.g., Sox9, Snai1), repression of angiogenesis and epigenetic regulation. These findings revealed that DNA methylation plays an important role in regulating BBB repair after stroke, through regulating processes associated with BBB restoration and prevalently with processes enhancing BBB injury.© 2023.

Acute and chronic exposure to MPTP resulted in decreased expression of genes involved in sodium channel regulation. However, upregulation of pro-inflammatory pathways was seen after single dose but not after chronic MPTP treatment. Dopamine biosynthesis and synaptic vesicle recycling pathways were downregulated in PD patients and after chronic MPTP treatment in mice.

Univariate regression and LASSO regression analyses were used to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to patient prognosis, and multivariate Cox regression analysis was applied to establish the risk score equation and construct the survival prognosis model. Receiver operating characteristic curve and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses with clinically independent prognostic parameters were performed to verify the predictive power of the model and further establish a prognostic nomogram.A total of 380 DEGs were identified in LUAD tissues through GEO and TCGA datasets, and 5 DEGs (TCN1, CENPF, MAOB, CRTAC1 and PLEK2) were screened out by multivariate Cox regression analysis, indicating that the prognostic risk model could be used as an independent prognostic factor (Hazard ratio = 1.520,P< 0.001). Internal and external validation of the model confirmed that the prediction model had good sensitivity and specificity (Area under the curve = 0.754, 0.737). Combining genetic models and clinical prognostic factors, nomograms can also predict overall survival more effectively.A 5-mRNA-based model was constructed to predict the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma, which may provide clinicians with reliable prognostic assessment tools and help clinical treatment decisions.©The Author(s) 2022.

Thus, biomarkers for prediction of antidepressant responses are needed, as predicting which patients will not respond to antidepressants can optimize selection of alternative therapies. We aimed to identify biomarkers that could predict antidepressant responsiveness using a novel data-driven approach based on statistical pattern recognition. We retrospectively divided patients with major depressive disorder into antidepressant responder and non-responder groups. Comprehensive gene expression analysis was performed using peripheral blood without narrowing the genes. We designed a classifier according to our own discrete Bayes decision rule that can handle categorical data. Nineteen genes showed differential expression in the antidepressant non-responder group (n = 15) compared to the antidepressant responder group (n = 15). In the training sample of 30 individuals, eight candidate genes had significantly altered expression according to quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The expression of these genes was examined in an independent test sample of antidepressant responders (n = 22) and non-responders (n = 12). Using the discrete Bayes classifier with theHERC5, IFI6,andIFI44genes identified in the training set yielded 85% discrimination accuracy for antidepressant responsiveness in the 34 test samples. Pathway analysis of the RNA sequencing data for antidepressant responsiveness identified that hypercytokinemia- and interferon-related genes were increased in non-responders. Disease and biofunction analysis identified changes in genes related to inflammatory and infectious diseases, including coronavirus disease. These results strongly suggest an association between antidepressant responsiveness and inflammation, which may be useful for future treatment strategies for depression.© 2023 The Authors."

PLCD1 plays a pivotal role in tumor suppression of several types of cancers; however, its expression and underlying molecular mechanisms in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) pathogenesis remain elusive.RT-PCR and Western blot were used to detect PLCD1 expression in RCC cell lines and normal tissues. Bisulfite treatment, MSP and BGS were utilized to explore the CpG methylation status of PLCD1 promoter. Online databases were analyzed for the association between PLCD1 expression/methylation and patient survival. In vitro experiments including CCK8, colony formation, wound-healing, transwell migration and invasion, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry assays were performed to evaluate tumor cell behavior. Luciferase assay and Western blot were used to examine effect of PLCD1 on WNT/β-catenin and EGFR-FAK-ERK signaling.We found that PLCD1 was widely expressed in multiple adult normal tissues including kidney, but frequently downregulated or silenced in RCC due to its promoter CpG methylation. Restoration of PLCD1 expression inhibited the viability, migration and induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in RCC cells. PLCD1 restoration led to the inhibition of signaling activation of WNT/β-catenin and EGFR-FAK-ERK pathways, and the EMT program of RCC cells.Our results demonstrate that PLCD1 is a potent tumor suppressor frequently inactivated by promoter methylation in RCC and exerts its tumor suppressive functions via suppressing WNT/β-catenin and EGFR-FAK-ERK signaling. These findings establish PLCD1 as a promising prognostic biomarker and treatment target for RCC.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Here, we comprehensively map the 3D genome topology reorganization during mouse SC lineage progression. Specifically, rewiring at the compartment level is most pronounced when SCs become activated. Marked loss in topologically associating domain (TAD) border insulation and chromatin looping also occurs during early activation process. Meanwhile, TADs can form TAD clusters and super-enhancer-containing TAD clusters orchestrate stage-specific gene expression. Furthermore, we uncover that transcription factor PAX7 is pivotal in enhancer-promoter (E-P) loop formation. We also identify cis-regulatory elements that are crucial for local chromatin organization atPax7locus andPax7expression. Lastly, we unveil that geriatric SC displays a prominent gain in long-range contacts and loss of TAD border insulation. Together, our results uncover that 3D chromatin extensively reorganizes at multiple architectural levels and underpins the transcriptome remodeling during SC lineage development and SC aging."
"36726011","Transcriptional reprogramming of skeletal muscle stem cells by the niche environment.","Nat Commun","Adult stem cells are indispensable for tissue regeneration, but their function declines with age. The niche environment in which the stem cells reside plays a critical role in their function. However, quantification of the niche effect on stem cell function is lacking. Using muscle stem cells (MuSC) as a model, we show that aging leads to a significant transcriptomic shift in their subpopulations accompanied by locus-specific gain and loss of chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation. By combining in vivo MuSC transplantation and computational methods, we show that the expression of approximately half of all age-altered genes in MuSCs from aged male mice can be restored by exposure to a young niche environment. While there is a correlation between gene reversibility and epigenetic alterations, restoration of gene expression occurs primarily at the level of transcription. The stem cell niche environment therefore represents an important therapeutic target to enhance tissue regeneration in aging.© 2023. The Author(s)."

It can affect many aspects of a patient's daily life, so it is necessary to explore the mechanism and pathological alterations. For this purpose, we applied induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived telencephalon organoids to recapitulate the alterations occurring in the early cerebral cortex of ADHD patients. We found that telencephalon organoids of ADHD showed less growth of layer structures than control-derived organoids. On day 35 of differentiation, the thinner cortex layer structures of ADHD-derived organoids contained more neurons than those of control-derived organoids. Furthermore, ADHD-derived organoids showed a decrease in cell proliferation during development from day 35 to 56. On day 56 of differentiation, there was a significant difference in the proportion of symmetric and asymmetric cell division between the ADHD and control groups. In addition, we observed increased cell apoptosis in ADHD during early development. These results show alterations in the characteristics of neural stem cells and the formation of layer structures, which might indicate key roles in the pathogenesis of ADHD.

"36763080","Regulatory dissection of the severe COVID-19 risk locus introgressed by Neanderthals.","Elife","Individuals infected with theSARS-CoV-2virus present with a wide variety of symptoms ranging from asymptomatic to severe and even lethal outcomes. Past research has revealed a genetic haplotype on chromosome 3 that entered the human population via introgression from Neanderthals as the strongest genetic risk factor for the severe response to COVID-19. However, the specific variants along this introgressed haplotype that contribute to this risk and the biological mechanisms that are involved remain unclear. Here, we assess the variants present on the risk haplotype for their likelihood of driving the genetic predisposition to severe COVID-19 outcomes. We do this by first exploring their impact on the regulation of genes involved in COVID-19 infection using a variety of population genetics and functional genomics tools. We then perform a locus-specific massively parallel reporter assay to individually assess the regulatory potential of each allele on the haplotype in a multipotent immune-related cell line. We ultimately reduce the set of over 600 linked genetic variants to identify four introgressed alleles that are strong functional candidates for driving the association between this locus and severe COVID-19. Using reporter assays in the presence/absence ofSARS-CoV-2, we find evidence that these variants respond to viral infection. These variants likely drive the locus' impact on severity by modulating the regulation of two critical chemokine receptor genes:CCR1andCCR5. These alleles are ideal targets for future functional investigations into the interaction between host genomics and COVID-19 outcomes.© 2023, Jagoda, Marnetto et al."

This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of m6A methylation in metabolic syndrome in offspring result from intrauterine hyperglycemia.GDM mice were established by feeding a high-fat diet 1 weeks before pregnancy. The m6A RNA methylation quantification kit was used to detect liver tissue methylation levels. PCR array was used to determine the expression of the m6A methylation modification enzyme. Immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR, and western blot were used to examine the expression of RBM15, METTL13, IGF2BP1, and IGF2BP2. Subsequently, methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing combined with mRNA sequencing, followed by dot blot and glucose uptake tests, were performed.In this study, we found that offspring from a GDM mother were more vulnerable to glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. GC-MS revealed significant metabolic changes including saturated fatty acids and unsaturated fatty acids in liver of GDM offspring. We also demonstrated that global mRNA m6A methylation level was significantly increased in the fetal liver of GDM mice, indicating epigenetic change may have a strong relationship with the mechanism of metabolism syndrome. Concordantly, RBM15, the RNA binding methyltransferase, was upregulated in the liver. In vitro, RBM15 suppressed insulin sensitivity and increased insulin resistance through m6A-regulated epigenetic inhabitation of CLDN4. Moreover, MeRIP-sequencing and mRNA-sequencing revealed that differently regulated genes with differential m6A peaks were enriched in metabolic pathways.Our study revealed the essential role of RBM15 in insulin resistance and the effect of RBM15-regulated m6A modification in the metabolic syndrome of offspring of GDM mice.© 2023.

However, it is unknown whether oxytocin influences the acquisition or the consolidation of the trauma. The current study investigates the effect of the activation of the oxytocin system during the consolidation of an analogue trauma on the formation of intrusive memories over four consecutive days and whether this effect is influenced by individual neurobiological, genetic, or psychological factors. We conducted a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study in 217 healthy women. They received either a single dose of intranasal oxytocin (24 IU) or placebo after exposure to a trauma film paradigm, which reliably induces intrusive memories. We used a general random forest to examine a potential heterogeneous treatment effect of oxytocin on the consolidation of intrusive memories. Furthermore, we used a poisson regression to examine whether salivary alpha amylase activity (sAA) as a marker of noradrenergic activity and cortisol response to the film, polygenic risk score (PRS) for psychiatric disorders, and psychological factors influence the number of intrusive memories. We found no significant effect of oxytocin on the formation of intrusive memories (F(2, 543.16) = 0.75, p = 0.51, ηp2 = 0.00) and identified no heterogeneous treatment effect. We replicated previous associations of the PRS for PTSD, sAA and the cortisol response on intrusive memories. We further found a positive association between high trait anxiety and intrusive memories, and a negative association between the emotion regulation strategy reappraisal and intrusive memories. Data of the present study suggest that the consolidation of intrusive memories in women is modulated by genetic, neurobiological and psychological factors, but is not influenced by oxytocin.

However, it is unclear whether this correlation is causally or violated by confounding or backward causality. Therefore, this study explored the potential causal relationship between intestinal metabolites and dependent metabolites on ASD.We used a two-sample Mendelian random analysis and selected variants closely related to intestinal flora-dependent metabolites as instrumental variables. MR-Egger, inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR-PRESSO, maximum likelihood, and weighted median were performed to reveal their causal relationships. Ten metabolites were studied, which included trimethylamine-N-oxide, betaine, carnitine, choline, glutamate, kynurenine, phenylalanine, serotonin, tryptophan, and tyrosine. Sensitivity tests were also performed to evaluate the robustness of the MR study.The IVW method revealed that serotonin may increase the ASD risk (OR 1.060, 95% CI: 1.006-1.118), while choline could decrease the ASD risk (OR 0.925, 95% CI: 0.868-0.988). However, no definite causality was observed between other intestinal metabolites (e.g., trimethylamine-N-oxide, betaine, and carnitine) with ASD. Additionally, neither the funnel plot nor the MR-Egger test showed horizontal pleiotropy, and the MR-PRESSO test found no outliers. Cochran's Q test showed no significant heterogeneity among the studies, suggesting the robustness of the study.Our study found potential causality from intestinal metabolites on ASD. Clinicians are encouraged to offer preventive measures to such populations.Copyright © 2023 Liu, Bu, Li, Wang, Ding and Fang."
"36693822","Polygenic risk for mental disorders as predictors of posttraumatic stress disorder after mild traumatic brain injury.","Transl Psychiatry","Many patients with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) are at risk for mental health problems such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The objective of this study was to determine whether the polygenic risk for PTSD (or for related mental health disorders or traits including major depressive disorder [MDD] and neuroticism [NEU]) was associated with an increased likelihood of PTSD in the aftermath of mTBI. We used data from individuals of European ancestry with mTBI enrolled in TRACK-TBI (n = 714), a prospective longitudinal study of level 1 trauma center patients. One hundred and sixteen mTBI patients (16.3%) had probable PTSD (PCL-5 score ≥33) at 6 months post-injury. We used summary statistics from recent GWAS studies of PTSD, MDD, and NEU to generate polygenic risk scores (PRS) for individuals in our sample. A multivariable model that included age, sex, pre-injury history of mental disorder, and cause of injury explained 7% of the variance in the PTSD outcome; the addition of the PTSD-PRS (and five ancestral principal components) significantly increased the variance explained to 11%. The adjusted odds of PTSD in the uppermost PTSD-PRS quintile was nearly four times higher (aOR = 3.71, 95% CI 1.80-7.65) than in the lowest PTSD-PRS quintile. There was no evidence of a statistically significant interaction between PTSD-PRS and prior history of mental disorder, indicating that PTSD-PRS had similar predictive utility among those with and without pre-injury psychiatric illness. When added to the model, neither MDD-PRS nor NEU-PRS were significantly associated with the PTSD outcome. These findings show that the risk for PTSD in the context of mTBI is, in part, genetically influenced. They also raise the possibility that an individual's PRS could be clinically actionable if used-possibly with other non-genetic predictors-to signal the need for enhanced follow-up and early intervention; this precision medicine approach needs to be prospectively studied.© 2023.

"36688949","Detecting genetic heterogeneities in response to trauma: The case of 9/11.","SSM Ment Health","The current study evaluates genetic heterogeneities in response to trauma among U.S. young adults. Using Add Health Wave III, which coincidently overlapped with the September 11 attacks, and a depression mean and variance polygenic scores, we investigate how the polygenic scores moderate the causal effect of 9/11 on mental health. Our results show the presence of genetic heterogeneity, where those with high genetic plasticity experience an increase in depressive symptoms following trauma while those with low genetic plasticity do not. While the documented differences in reactions to trauma are important, we also note our ability to predict responses based only on genetic measures are too imprecise to identify susceptible clinical patients. We, therefore, contend that the expected benefits from genetic screening to identify susceptible individuals after trauma are limited. Our results provide novel evidence of a specific source of an additional heterogeneity contributing to the inequality of health following trauma."
"36768184","Epigenetic Factors Related to Low Back Pain: A Systematic Review of the Current Literature.","Int J Mol Sci","Low back pain (LBP) is one of the most common causes of pain and disability. At present, treatment and interventions for acute and chronic low back pain often fail to provide sufficient levels of pain relief, and full functional restoration can be challenging. Considering the significant socio-economic burden and risk-to-benefit ratio of medical and surgical intervention in low back pain patients, the identification of reliable biomarkers such as epigenetic factors associated with low back pain could be useful in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to review the available literature regarding the epigenetic factors associated with low back pain. This review was carried out in accordance with Preferential Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The search was carried out in October 2022. Only peer-reviewed articles were considered for inclusion. Fourteen studies were included and showed promising results in terms of reliable markers. Epigenetic markers for LBP have the potential to significantly modify disease management. Most recent evidence suggests that epigenetics is a more promising field for the identification of factors associated with LBP, offering a rationale for further investigation in this field with the long-term goal of finding epigenetic biomarkers that could constitute biological targets for disease management and treatment."

This epigenetic reprogramming is activated by exogenous or endogenous insults, leading to altered healthy and different disease states. The epigenetic and environmental changes involve a roadmap of epigenetic networking, such as dietary components and exercise on epigenetic imprinting and restoring epigenome patterns laid down during embryonic development, which are paramount to establishing youthful cell type and health. Nutrition and exercise are among the most well-known environmental epigenetic factors influencing the proper developmental and functional lifestyle, with potential beneficial or detrimental effects on health status. The diet and exercise strategies applied from conception could represent an innovative epigenetic target for preventing and treating human diseases. Here, we describe the potential role of diet and exercise as therapeutic epigenetic strategies for health and diseases, highlighting putative future perspectives in this field."

"36815187","Pilot study suggests DNA methylation of the glucocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C1) is associated with MDMA-assisted therapy treatment response for severe PTSD.","Front Psychiatry","Previous research has demonstrated that epigenetic changes in specific hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) genes may predict successful psychotherapy in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A recent Phase 3 clinical trial reported high efficacy of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted therapy for treating patients with severe PTSD compared to a therapy with placebo group (NCT03537014). This raises important questions regarding potential mechanisms of MDMA-assisted therapy. In the present study, we examined epigenetic changes in three key HPA axis genes before and after MDMA and placebo with therapy. As a pilot sub-study to the parent clinical trial, we assessed potential HPA epigenetic predictors for treatment response with genomic DNA derived from saliva (MDMA,n= 16; placebo,n= 7). Methylation levels at all 259 CpG sites annotated to three HPA genes (CRHR1,FKBP5, andNR3C1) were assessed in relation to treatment response as measured by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5; Total Severity Score). Second, group (MDMA vs. placebo) differences in methylation change were assessed for sites that predicted treatment response.Methylation change across groups significantly predicted symptom reduction on 37 of 259 CpG sites tested, with two sites surviving false discovery rate (FDR) correction. Further, the MDMA-treatment group showed more methylation change compared to placebo on one site of theNR3C1gene.The findings of this study suggest that therapy-related PTSD symptom improvements may be related to DNA methylation changes in HPA genes and such changes may be greater in those receiving MDMA-assisted therapy. These findings can be used to generate hypothesis driven analyses for future studies with larger cohorts.Copyright © 2023 Lewis, Tafur, Spencer, Green, Harrison, Kelmendi, Rabin, Yehuda, Yazar-Klosinski and Cahn."
"36835161","Alzheimer's Disease: An Updated Overview of Its Genetics.","Int J Mol Sci","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease in the world. It is classified as familial and sporadic. The dominant familial or autosomal presentation represents 1-5% of the total number of cases. It is categorized as early onset (EOAD; <65 years of age) and presents genetic mutations inpresenilin 1(PSEN1),presenilin 2(PSEN2), or theAmyloid precursor protein(APP). Sporadic AD represents 95% of the cases and is categorized as late-onset (LOAD), occurring in patients older than 65 years of age. Several risk factors have been identified in sporadic AD; aging is the main one. Nonetheless, multiple genes have been associated with the different neuropathological events involved in LOAD, such as the pathological processing of Amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide and Tau protein, as well as synaptic and mitochondrial dysfunctions, neurovascular alterations, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation, among others. Interestingly, using genome-wide association study (GWAS) technology, many polymorphisms associated with LOAD have been identified. This review aims to analyze the new genetic findings that are closely related to the pathophysiology of AD. Likewise, it analyzes the multiple mutations identified to date through GWAS that are associated with a high or low risk of developing this neurodegeneration. Understanding genetic variability will allow for the identification of early biomarkers and opportune therapeutic targets for AD."

Structured questionnaires were administered, and blood pressure (BP) and anthropometric measurements were performed by trained personnel. Multiple logistic regression analysis was done to investigate factors associated with prehypertension progressing to hypertension.Over the 2-year follow-up, 28.5% experienced progression of prehypertension to hypertension; this occurred more frequently in men than women (29.7% vs. 27.1%).

"36814838","Identifying key multifunctional components shared by critical cancer and normal liver pathways via SparseGMM.","Cell Rep Methods","Despite the abundance of multimodal data, suitable statistical models that can improve our understanding of diseases with genetic underpinnings are challenging to develop. Here, we present SparseGMM, a statistical approach for gene regulatory network discovery. SparseGMM uses latent variable modeling with sparsity constraints to learn Gaussian mixtures from multiomic data. By combining coexpression patterns with a Bayesian framework, SparseGMM quantitatively measures confidence in regulators and uncertainty in target gene assignment by computing gene entropy. We apply SparseGMM to liver cancer and normal liver tissue data and evaluate discovered gene modules in an independent single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset. SparseGMM identifies PROCR as a regulator of angiogenesis and PDCD1LG2 and HNF4A as regulators of immune response and blood coagulation in cancer. Furthermore, we show that more genes have significantly higher entropy in cancer compared with normal liver. Among high-entropy genes are key multifunctional components shared by critical pathways, including p53 and estrogen signaling.© 2022 The Authors."

Previously, we showed that technical replicates can be used for precise estimates of this noise, and we provided a tool for correction of technical noise in allele-specific expression analysis. This approach is very accurate but costly due to the need for two or more replicates of each library. Here, we develop a spike-in approach that is highly accurate at only a small fraction of the cost.We show that a distinct RNA added as a spike-in before library preparation reflects technical noise of the whole library and can be used in large batches of samples. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using combinations of RNA from species distinguishable by alignment, namely, mouse, human, andC.elegans. Our new approach, controlFreq , enables highly accurate and computationally efficient analysis of allele-specific expression in (and between) arbitrarily large studies at an overall cost increase of ~ 5%.Analysis pipeline for this approach is available at GitHub as R package controlFreq ( github.com/gimelbrantlab/controlFreq ).agimelbrant@altius.org."
"36685594","Epigenetic modification-related mechanisms of hepatocellular carcinoma resistance to immune checkpoint inhibition.","Front Immunol","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) constitutes most primary liver cancers and is one of the most lethal and life-threatening malignancies globally. Unfortunately, a substantial proportion of HCC patients are identified at an advanced stage that is unavailable for curative surgery. Thus, palliative therapies represented by multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) sorafenib remained the front-line treatment over the past decades. Recently, the application of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), especially targeting the PD-1/PD-L1/CTLA-4 axis, has achieved an inspiring clinical breakthrough for treating unresectable solid tumors. However, many HCC patients with poor responses lead to limited benefits in clinical applications, which has quickly drawn researchers' attention to the regulatory mechanisms of immune checkpoints in HCC immune evasion. Evasion of immune surveillance by cancer is attributed to intricate reprogramming modulation in the tumor microenvironment. Currently, more and more studies have found that epigenetic modifications, such as chromatin structure remodeling, DNA methylation, histone post-translational modifications, and non-coding RNA levels, may contribute significantly to remodeling the tumor microenvironment to avoid immune clearance, affecting the efficacy of immunotherapy for HCC. This review summarizes the rapidly emerging progress of epigenetic-related changes during HCC resistance to ICIs and discusses the mechanisms of underlying epigenetic therapies available for surmounting immune resistance. Finally, we summarize the clinical advances in combining epigenetic therapies with immunotherapy, aiming to promote the formation of immune combination therapy strategies.Copyright © 2023 Tao, Liang, Zeng and Yin."

Far simpler is to address the abnormalities caused by those metabolic and genetic changes in the cell types of the brain that mediate the behavioral abnormality. Relevant data regarding the changed brain cell types are described in this article and are derived from subjects with the paradigmatic behavioral abnormality of PTSD and from subjects with traumatic brain injury or chronic traumatic encephalopathy. If this analysis is correct, then therapy is required that benefits all of the affected brain cell types; those are astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, synapses and neurons, endothelial cells, and microglia (the pro-inflammatory (M1) subtype requires switching to the anti-inflammatory (M2) subtype). Combinations are advocated using several drugs, erythropoietin, fluoxetine, lithium, and pioglitazone, that benefit all of the five cell types, and that should be used to form a two-drug combination, suggested as pioglitazone with either fluoxetine or lithium. Clemastine, fingolimod, and memantine benefit four of the cell types, and one chosen from those could be added to the two-drug combination to form a three-drug combination. Using low doses of chosen drugs will limit both toxicity and drug-drug interactions. A clinical trial is required to validate both the advocated concept and the choice of drugs."
"36824367","miR-514a promotes neuronal development in human iPSC-derived neurons.","Front Cell Dev Biol","Proper development and function of the central nervous system require precise regulation of gene expression. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a group of small non-coding RNAs that can negatively regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, are critical regulators of neuronal development, and dysregulation of microRNAs has been implicated in various neurological disorders. Changes in microRNA expression and repertoire are related to the emergence of social and behavioral variations in closely related primates, including humans, during evolution. MicroRNA-514a (miR-514a) is an X-linked miRNA that is conserved in species with higher social and cognitive functions, and frequent tandem duplications of miR-514a have been found in primate genomes. Here, we demonstrate that miR-514a plays a crucial role in neuronal development in neurons derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Overexpression of miR-514a increased dendritic length, soma size, and activity levels of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons, whereas blocking of endogenous miR-514a inhibited neuronal development. Furthermore, we performed a functional analysis of the miR-514a variation found during primate evolution, to investigate the impact of miR-514a sequence variation and associated changes in expression on brain development during evolution. We found that mutation in miR-514a significantly reduced the expression of the mature form and abolished the effects observed when native miR-514a was expressed. Our findings provide new insights into the functional role of miR-514a in the regulation of neuronal development and evolution of primate brain development.Copyright © 2023 Akaba, Takahashi, Suzuki, Kosaki and Tsujimura."

However, the relationship between shared symptoms and shared genetic liability is still poorly understood.Well-characterised, cross-disorder samples are needed to investigate this matter, but few currently exist. Our aim is to develop procedures to purposely curate and aggregate genotypic and phenotypic data in psychiatric research.As part of the Cardiff MRC Mental Health Data Pathfinder initiative, we have curated and harmonised phenotypic and genetic information from 15 studies to create a new data repository, DRAGON-Data. To date, DRAGON-Data includes over 45 000 individuals: adults and children with neurodevelopmental or psychiatric diagnoses, affected probands within collected families and individuals who carry a known neurodevelopmental risk copy number variant.We have processed the available phenotype information to derive core variables that can be reliably analysed across groups. In addition, all data-sets with genotype information have undergone rigorous quality control, imputation, copy number variant calling and polygenic score generation.DRAGON-Data combines genetic and non-genetic information, and is available as a resource for research across traditional psychiatric diagnostic categories.

Baseline data of a school cohort of physical and mental health status and life experience survey on primary and secondary school students in Anhui Province, China was used. Childhood maltreatment of children and adolescents was assessed by Chinese version of Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form (CTQ-SF). Urine samples were collected to assess levels of soluble urokinase Plasminogen Activator Receptor (suPAR), C-reactive protein (CRP) and cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Logistic regression was conducted to examine the association between childhood maltreatment exposure and risk of high inflammation burden. A total of 844 students were included with mean age 11.41 ± 1.57 years old. Adolescents with emotional abuse were significantly more likely to have high level of IL-6 (OR = 3.59, 95% CI 1.16-11.14). In addition, adolescents with emotional abuse were more likely to show high IL-6 and high suPAR combination (OR = 33.41, 95% CI 1.69-659.22), and high IL-6 and low CRP combination (OR = 4.34, 95% CI 1.29-14.55). Subgroup analyses showed that emotional abuse was associated with high IL-6 burden among boys or adolescents with depression. Childhood emotional abuse was positively associated with higher burden of IL-6. Early detection and prevention of emotional abuse for children and adolescents, especially for boys or adolescents with depression status, may be helpful for preventing elevated inflammatory burden and related health problems.© 2023.

"36797759","DNA methylation entropy as a measure of stem cell replication and aging.","Genome Biol","Epigenetic marks are encoded by DNA methylation and accumulate errors as organisms age. This drift correlates with lifespan, but the biology of how this occurs is still unexplained. We analyze DNA methylation with age in mouse intestinal stem cells and compare them to nonstem cells.Age-related changes in DNA methylation are identical in stem and nonstem cells, affect most prominently CpG islands and correlate weakly with gene expression. Age-related DNA methylation entropy, measured by the Jensen-Shannon Distribution, affects up to 25% of the detectable CpG sites and is a better measure of aging than individual CpG methylation. We analyze this entropy as a function of age in seven other tissues (heart, kidney, skeletal muscle, lung, liver, spleen, and blood) and it correlates strikingly with tissue-specific stem cell division rates. Thus, DNA methylation drift and increased entropy with age are primarily caused by and are sensors for, stem cell replication in adult tissues.These data have implications for the mechanisms of tissue-specific functional declines with aging and for the development of DNA-methylation-based biological clocks.© 2023.

When these mutations occur in ""driver"" genes, they can potentially confer fitness advantages to the cell, leading to a clonal expansion. While most clonal expansions of mutant cells are generally considered to be asymptomatic since they do not impact overall blood cell numbers, CH carriers display long-term risks of all-cause mortality and age-associated diseases including cardiovascular disease (CVD). This review summarizes recent findings in CH related to aging, atherosclerotic CVD, and inflammation, emphasizing epidemiological and mechanistic studies, and potential therapeutic options to treat CVDs that are promoted by CH.Epidemiological studies have revealed associations between CH and CVDs. Experimental studies with CH models employing the Tet2- and Jak2-mutant mouse lines display inflammasome activation and a chronic inflammatory state that leads to accelerated atherosclerotic lesion growth. A body of evidence suggests that CH represents a new causal risk factor for CVD. Studies also indicate that understanding an individual's CH status could provide guidance for personalized approaches to treat atherosclerosis and other CVDs with anti-inflammatory drugs.© 2023.

"36849495","Re-analysis of publicly available methylomes using signal detection yields new information.","Sci Rep","Cytosine methylation is an epigenetic mark that participates in regulation of gene expression and chromatin stability in plants. Advancements in whole genome sequencing technologies have enabled investigation of methylome dynamics under different conditions. However, the computational methods for analyzing bisulfite sequence data have not been unified. Contention remains in the correlation of differentially methylated positions with the investigated treatment and exclusion of noise, inherent to these stochastic datasets. The prevalent approaches apply Fisher's exact test, logistic, or beta regression, followed by an arbitrary cut-off for differences in methylation levels. A different strategy, the MethylIT pipeline, utilizes signal detection to determine cut-off based on a fitted generalized gamma probability distribution of methylation divergence. Re-analysis of publicly available BS-seq data from two epigenetic studies in Arabidopsis and applying MethylIT revealed additional, previously unreported results. Methylome repatterning in response to phosphate starvation was confirmed to be tissue-specific and included phosphate assimilation genes in addition to sulfate metabolism genes not implicated in the original study. During seed germination plants undergo major methylome reprogramming and use of MethylIT allowed us to identify stage-specific gene networks. We surmise from these comparative studies that robust methylome experiments must account for data stochasticity to achieve meaningful functional analyses.© 2023. The Author(s)."

In most mammals, including humans and mice, the size of the chromosome is ~16,000 base pairs and unlike nuclear DNA, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is not densely compacted. This results in mtDNA to be highly accessible for enzymes such as the Tn5 transposase, commonly used for accessible chromatin profiling of nuclear chromatinized DNA. Here, we describe a method for the concomitant sequencing of mtDNA and accessible chromatin in thousands of individual cells via the mitochondrial single-cell assay for transposase accessible chromatin by sequencing (mtscATAC-seq). Our approach extends the utility of existing scATAC-seq products and protocols as we (Nam et al, Nat Rev Genet 22:3-18, 2021) fix cells using formaldehyde to retain mitochondria and its mtDNA within its originating cell, (Buenrostro et al, Nat Methods 10:1213-1218, 2013) modify lysis conditions to permeabilize cells and mitochondria, and (Corces et al, Nat Methods 14:959-962, 2017) optimize bioinformatic processing protocols to collectively increase mitochondrial genome coverage for downstream analysis. Here, we discuss the essentials for the experimental and computational methodologies to generate and analyze thousands of multiomic profiles of single cells over the course of a few days, enabling the profiling of accessible chromatin and mtDNA genotypes to reconstruct clonal relationships and studies of mitochondrial genetics and disease.© 2023.

Such mosaicism has been implicated in a broad range of developmental anomalies; however, their etiology is poorly understood. Patients carrying a common somatic oncogenic mutation in either PIK3CA or AKT1 can present with disproportionally large digits or limbs. How mutant clones, carrying an oncogenic mutation that often drives unchecked proliferation, can lead to controlled and coordinated overgrowth is unknown. We use zebrafish to explore the growth dynamics of oncogenic clones during development. Here, in a subset of clones, we observed a local increase in proportion of the fin skeleton closely resembling overgrowth phenotypes in patients. We unravel the cellular and developmental mechanisms of these overgrowths, and pinpoint the cell type and timing of clonal expansion. Coordinated overgrowth is associated with rapid clone expansion during early pre-chondrogenic phase of bone development, inducing a heterochronic shift that drives the change in bone size. Our study details how development integrates and translates growth potential of oncogenic clones, thereby shaping the phenotypic consequences of somatic mutations.© 2023.

"36828915","S100 family proteins are linked to organoid morphology and EMT in pancreatic cancer.","Cell Death Differ","Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a continuum that includes epithelial, partial EMT, and mesenchymal states, each of which is associated with cancer progression, invasive capabilities, and ultimately, metastasis. We used a lineage-traced sporadic model of pancreatic cancer to generate a murine organoid biobank from primary and secondary tumors, including sublines that underwent partial EMT and complete EMT. Using an unbiased proteomics approach, we found that organoid morphology predicts the EMT state, and the solid organoids are associated with a partial EMT signature. We also observed that exogenous TGFβ1 induces solid organoid morphology that is associated with changes in the S100 family, complete EMT, and the formation of high-grade tumors. S100A4 may be a useful biomarker for predicting EMT state, disease progression, and outcome in patients with pancreatic cancer.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36725963","Tumor organoid biobank-new platform for medical research.","Sci Rep","Organoids are a new type of 3D model for tumor research, which makes up for the shortcomings of cell lines and xenograft models, and promotes the development of personalized precision medicine. Long-term culture, expansion and storage of organoids provide the necessary conditions for the establishment of biobanks. Biobanks standardize the collection and preservation of normal or pathological specimens, as well as related clinical information. The tumor organoid biobank has a good quality control system, which is conducive to the clinical transformation and large-scale application of tumor organoids, such as disease modeling, new drug development and high-throughput drug screening. This article summarized the common tumor types of patient-derived organoid (PDO) biobanks and the necessary information for biobank construction, such as the number of organoids, morphology, success rate of culture and resuscitation, pathological types. In our results, we found that patient-derived tumor organoid (PDTO) biobanks were being established more and more, with the Netherlands, the United States, and China establishing the most. Biobanks of colorectal, pancreas, breast, glioma, and bladder cancers were established more, which reflected the relative maturity of culture techniques for these tumors. In addition, we provided insights on the precautions and future development direction of PDTO biobank building.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36713532","Pancreatic cancer derived 3D organoids as a clinical tool to evaluate the treatment response.","Front Oncol","Pancreatic cancer (PC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in both men and women. The standard of care for patients with locally advanced PC of chemotherapy, stereotactic radiotherapy (RT), or chemo-radiation-therapy has shown highly variable and limited success rates. However, three-dimensional (3D) Pancreatic tumor organoids (PTOs) have shown promise to study tumor response to drugs, and emerging treatments underin vitroconditions. We investigated the potential for using 3D organoids to evaluate the precise radiation and drug dose responses ofin vivoPC tumors.PTOs were created from mouse pancreatic tumor tissues, and their microenvironment was compared to that ofin vivotumors using immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining. The organoids andin vivoPC tumors were treated with fractionated X-ray RT, 3-bromopyruvate (3BP) anti-tumor drug, and combination of 3BP + fractionated RT.Pancreatic tumor organoids (PTOs) exhibited a similar fibrotic microenvironment and molecular response (as seen by apoptosis biomarker expression) asin vivotumors. Untreated tumor organoids andin vivotumor both exhibited proliferative growth of 6 folds the original size after 10 days, whereas no growth was seen for organoids andin vivotumors treated with 8 (Gray) Gy of fractionated RT. Tumor organoids showed reduced growth rates of 3.2x and 1.8x when treated with 4 and 6 Gy fractionated RT, respectively. Interestingly, combination of 100 µM of 3BP + 4 Gy of RT showed pronounced growth inhibition as compared to 3-BP alone or 4 Gy of radiation alone. Further, positive identification of SOX2, SOX10 and TGFβ indicated presence of cancer stem cells in tumor organoids which might have some role in resistance to therapies in pancreatic cancer.PTOs produced a similar microenvironment and exhibited similar growth characteristics asin vivotumors following treatment, indicating their potential for predictingin vivotumor sensitivity and response to RT and combined chemo-RT treatments.Copyright © 2023 Shukla, Dukic, Roy, Bhandary, Gerry, Poirier, Lamichhane, Molitoris, Carrier, Banerjee, Regine and Polf."
"36849463","Parental personality and early life ecology: a prospective cohort study from preconception to postpartum.","Sci Rep","Personality reliably predicts life outcomes ranging from social and material resources to mental health and interpersonal capacities. However, little is known about the potential intergenerational impact of parent personality prior to offspring conception on family resources and child development across the first thousand days of life. We analysed data from the Victorian Intergenerational Health Cohort Study (665 parents, 1030 infants; est. 1992), a two-generation study with prospective assessment of preconception background factors in parental adolescence, preconception personality traits in young adulthood (agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, extraversion, and openness), and multiple parental resources and infant characteristics in pregnancy and after the birth of their child. After adjusting for pre-exposure confounders, both maternal and paternal preconception personality traits were associated with numerous parental resources and attributes in pregnancy and postpartum, as well as with infant biobehavioural characteristics. Effect sizes ranged from small to moderate when considering parent personality traits as continuous exposures, and from small to large when considering personality traits as binary exposures. Young adult personality, well before offspring conception, is associated with the perinatal household social and financial context, parental mental health, parenting style and self-efficacy, and temperamental characteristics of offspring. These are pivotal aspects of early life development that ultimately predict a child's long-term health and development.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36845057","Associations between maternal dietary scores during early pregnancy with placental outcomes.","Front Nutr","Individual macronutrient and micronutrient effects on placental growth have been widely investigated. However, the influence of overall maternal diet is relatively unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine associations between a range of maternal dietary scores during early pregnancy with placental outcomes, and to investigate whether there is evidence of sexual dimorphism.This analysis of the Lifeways Cross-Generational Cohort includes 276 mother-child pairs. A validated 148-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire assessed maternal diet in early pregnancy. Dietary scores reflecting dietary quality [Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2015), Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)], dietary inflammatory potential [Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) and the energy adjusted DII (E-DII)], dietary antioxidant status [Dietary Antioxidant Quality (DAQ)], and glycemic and insulinemic loads/indices (GL/GI, IL/II) were calculated. Linear regression analyses assessed maternal dietary score relationships with untrimmed placental weight (PW) and birth weight:placental weight (BW:PW) ratio.In fully adjusted models, maternal E-DII and GI were positively associated, and HEI-2015 and DAQ were negatively associated with PW (B: 12.31, 95% CI: 0.41, 24.20,p = 0.04, B: 4.13, 95% CI: 0.10, 8.17,p = 0.04, B: -2.70, 95% CI: -5.03, -0.35,p = 0.02 and B: -15.03, 95% CI: -28.08, -1.98,p = 0.02, for E-DII, GI, HEI-2015 and DAQ respectively). Maternal DAQ associations with BW:PW ratio were attenuated. When stratified by sex, maternal GI and pregnancy-specific DAQ were associated with PW in female offspring (B: 5.61, 95% CI: 0.27, 10.96,p = 0.04 and B: -15.31, 95% CI: -30.35, -0.27,p = 0.046). Maternal E-DII and HEI-2015 were associated with PW in males (B: 24.31, 95% CI: 5.66, 42.96,p = 0.01 and B: -3.85, 95% CI: -7.47, -0.35,p = 0.03 respectively).The results of this novel investigation suggest that maternal diet may influence placental development. Female fetuses may be more sensitive to increased glucose levels whereas male fetuses may be more susceptible toin-uterostresses that are regulated by inflammatory pathways and overall diet quality. Hence, early pregnancy offers an opportune time for a mother to prioritize dietary changes that focus on reducing inflammatory and glycemic responses.Copyright © 2023 Teo, Murrin, Mehegan, Douglas, Hébert, Segurado, Kelleher and Phillips."
"36736319","Maturational patterns of the infant gut mycobiome are associated with early-life body mass index.","Cell Rep Med","Unlike the bacterial microbiome, the role of early-life gut fungi in host metabolism and childhood obesity development remains poorly characterized. To address this, we investigate the relationship between the gut mycobiome of 100 infants from the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) Cohort Study and body mass index Z scores (BMIz) in the first 5 years of life. An increase in fungal richness during the first year of life is linked to parental and infant BMI. The relationship between richness pattern and early-life BMIz is modified by maternal BMI, maternal diet, infant antibiotic exposure, and bacterial beta diversity. Further, the abundances of Saccharomyces, Rhodotorula, and Malassezia are differentially associated with early-life BMIz. Using structural equation modeling, we determine that the mycobiome's contribution to BMIz is likely mediated by the bacterial microbiome. This demonstrates that mycobiome maturation and infant growth trajectories are distinctly linked, advocating for inclusion of fungi in larger pediatric microbiome studies.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

"36831292","Chordin-like 1, a Novel Adipokine, Markedly Promotes Adipogenesis and Lipid Accumulation.","Cells","White adipose tissue serves as a metabolically dynamic organ that can synthesize and secrete biologically active compounds such as adipokines as well as a caloric reservoir for maintaining energy homeostasis. Adipokines are involved in diverse biological and physiological processes and there have been extensive attempts to characterize the effects of over two dozen adipokines. However, many of these adipokines are produced by not only adipose tissue, but also other tissues. Therefore, investigations into the effects of adipokines on physiological functions have been challenged. In this regard, we aimed to identify a new secreted protein that is encoded by genes specifically expressed in white adipose tissue through analysis of multi-tissue transcriptome and protein expression. As a result, we report a novel adipokine that is encoded by the adipose-specific gene, chordin-like 1 (Chrdl1), which is specifically expressed in white adipose tissue in mice; this expression pattern was conserved in the human orthologousCHRDL1gene. The expression ofChrdl1was enriched in fat cells and developmentally regulated in vitro and in vivo, and moreover, its retrovirus-mediated overexpression and recombinant protein treatment led to markedly increased adipogenesis. Further pathway enrichment analysis revealed enriched pathways related to lipogenesis and adipogenic signaling. Our findings support a pro-adipogenic role of CHRDL1 as a new adipokine and pave the way toward animal studies and future research on its clinical implications and development of anti-obesity therapy."

The clinical and molecular features of hematologic malignancies are highly heterogenous, and some hematologic malignancies are incurable, challenging the treatment, and prognosis of the patients. However, hematopoiesis and oncogenesis of hematologic malignancies are profoundly affected by epigenetic regulation. Studies have found that methylation-related mutations, abnormal methylation profiles of DNA, and abnormal histone deacetylase expression are recurrent in leukemia and lymphoma. Furthermore, the hypomethylating agents and histone deacetylase inhibitors are effective to treat acute myeloid leukemia and T-cell lymphomas, indicating that epigenetic regulation is indispensable to hematologic oncogenesis. Epigenetic regulation mainly includes DNA modifications, histone modifications, and noncoding RNA-mediated targeting, and regulates various DNA-based processes. This review presents the role of writers, readers, and erasers of DNA methylation and histone methylation, and acetylation in hematologic malignancies. In addition, this review provides the influence of microRNAs and long noncoding RNAs on hematologic malignancies. Furthermore, the implication of epigenetic regulation in targeted treatment is discussed. This review comprehensively presents the change and function of each epigenetic regulator in normal and oncogenic hematopoiesis and provides innovative epigenetic-targeted treatment in clinical practice.© 2023.

Cancer genomes have a distinct methylation landscape (Methylscape), which could be used as a universal cancer biomarker. This study developed a simple, low-cost, and straightforward Methylscape sensing platform using cysteamine-decorated gold nanoparticles (Cyst/AuNPs), in which the sensing principle is based on methylation-dependent DNA solvation. Normal and cancer DNAs have distinct methylation profiles; thus, they can be distinguished by observing the dispersion of Cyst/AuNPs adsorbed on these DNA aggregates in MgCl2solution. After optimising the MgCl2, Cyst/AuNPs, DNA concentration, and incubation time, the optimised conditions were used for leukemia screening, by comparing the relative absorbance (ΔA650/525). Following the DNA extraction from actual blood samples, this sensor demonstrated effective leukemia screening in 15 minutes with high sensitivity, achieving 95.3% accuracy based on the measurement by an optical spectrophotometer. To further develop for practical realisation, a smartphone assisted by machine learning was used to screen cancer patients, achieving 90.0% accuracy in leukemia screening. This sensing platform can be applied not only for leukemia screening but also for other cancers associated with epigenetic modification.This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry."

Here, we used multi-omic profiling to characterize interactions between maternal genetics, milk gene expression, milk composition, and the infant fecal microbiome in 242 exclusively breastfeeding mother-infant pairs. We identified 487 genetic loci associated with milk gene expression unique to the lactating mammary gland, including loci that impacted breast cancer risk and human milk oligosaccharide concentration. Integrative analyses uncovered connections between milk gene expression and infant gut microbiome, including an association between the expression of inflammation-related genes with IL-6 concentration in milk and the abundance ofBifidobacteriain the infant gut. Our results show how an improved understanding of the genetics and genomics of human milk connects lactation biology with maternal and infant health."
"36828916","BAP18 facilitates CTCF-mediated chromatin accessible to regulate enhancer activity in breast cancer.","Cell Death Differ","The estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) signaling pathway is a crucial target for ERα-positive breast cancer therapeutic strategies. Co-regulators and other transcription factors cooperate for effective ERα-related enhancer activation. Recent studies demonstrate that the transcription factor CTCF is essential to participate in ERα/E2-induced enhancer transactivation. However, the mechanism of how CTCF is achieved remains unknown. Here, we provided evidence that BAP18 is required for CTCF recruitment on ERα-enriched enhancers, facilitating CTCF-mediated chromatin accessibility to promote enhancer RNAs transcription. Consistently, GRO-seq demonstrates that the enhancer activity is positively correlated with BAP18 enrichment. Furthermore, BAP18 interacts with SMARCA1/BPTF to accelerate the recruitment of CTCF to ERα-related enhancers. Interestingly, BAP18 is involved in chromatin accessibility within enhancer regions, thereby increasing enhancer transactivation and enhancer-promoter looping. BAP18 depletion increases the sensitivity of anti-estrogen and anti-enhancer treatment in MCF7 cells. Collectively, our study indicates that BAP18 coordinates with CTCF to enlarge the transactivation of ERα-related enhancers, providing a better understanding of BAP18/CTCF coupling chromatin remodeling and E-P looping in the regulation of enhancer transcription.© 2023.

We generated a user-friendly browser ( https://estrogene.org/ ) for data visualization and gene inquiry under user-defined experimental conditions and statistical thresholds. Notably, documentation-based meta-analysis revealed a considerable lack of experimental details. Comparison of independent RNA-seq or ER ChIP-seq data with the same design showed large variability and only strong effects could be consistently detected. We defined temporal estrogen response metasignatures and showed the association with specific transcriptional factors, chromatin accessibility and ER heterogeneity. Unexpectedly, harmonizing 146 transcriptomic analyses uncovered a subset of E2-bidirectionally regulated genes, which linked to immune surveillance in the clinical setting. Furthermore, we defined context dependent E2 response programs in MCF7 and T47D cell lines, the two most frequently used models in the field. Collectively, the EstroGene database provides an informative resource to the cancer research community and reveals a diverse mode of ER signaling."
"36869380","Loss of MLL3/4 decouples enhancer H3K4 monomethylation, H3K27 acetylation, and gene activation during embryonic stem cell differentiation.","Genome Biol","Enhancers are essential in defining cell fates through the control of cell-type-specific gene expression. Enhancer activation is a multi-step process involving chromatin remodelers and histone modifiers including the monomethylation of H3K4 (H3K4me1) by MLL3 (KMT2C) and MLL4 (KMT2D). MLL3/4 are thought to be critical for enhancer activation and cognate gene expression including through the recruitment of acetyltransferases for H3K27.Here we test this model by evaluating the impact of MLL3/4 loss on chromatin and transcription during early differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells. We find that MLL3/4 activity is required at most if not all sites that gain or lose H3K4me1 but is largely dispensable at sites that remain stably methylated during this transition. This requirement extends to H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac) at most transitional sites. However, many sites gain H3K27ac independent of MLL3/4 or H3K4me1 including enhancers regulating key factors in early differentiation. Furthermore, despite the failure to gain active histone marks at thousands of enhancers, transcriptional activation of nearby genes is largely unaffected, thus uncoupling the regulation of these chromatin events from transcriptional changes during this transition. These data challenge current models of enhancer activation and imply distinct mechanisms between stable and dynamically changing enhancers.Collectively, our study highlights gaps in knowledge about the steps and epistatic relationships of enzymes necessary for enhancer activation and cognate gene transcription.© 2023.

This approach is particularly critical for understanding attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which has unique public health importance given its early onset, high prevalence, individual variability, and causal association with co-occurring and later developing problems. A further priority concerns multi-disciplinary/multi-method datasets that can span different units of analysis. Here, we describe a public dataset using a case-control design for ADHD that includes: multi-method, multi-measure, multi-informant, multi-trait data, and multi-clinician evaluation and phenotyping. It spans > 12 years of annual follow-up with a lag longitudinal design allowing age-based analyses spanning age 7-19 + years with a full age range from 7 to 21. Measures span genetic and epigenetic (DNA methylation) array data; EEG, functional and structural MRI neuroimaging;; and psychophysiological, psychosocial, clinical and functional outcomes data. The resource also benefits from an autism spectrum disorder add-on cohort and a cross sectional case-control ADHD cohort from a different geographical region for replication and generalizability.

To understand this interplay, we generated a single-cell atlas of immune, glial and retinal pigment epithelial cells from adult mouse retina before and at multiple time points after axonal transection. We identified rare subsets in naive retina, including interferon (IFN)-response glia and border-associated macrophages, and delineated injury-induced changes in cell composition, expression programs and interactions. Computational analysis charted a three-phase multicellular inflammatory cascade after injury. In the early phase, retinal macroglia and microglia were reactivated, providing chemotactic signals concurrent with infiltration of CCR2+monocytes from the circulation. These cells differentiated into macrophages in the intermediate phase, while an IFN-response program, likely driven by microglia-derived type I IFN, was activated across resident glia. The late phase indicated inflammatory resolution. Our findings provide a framework to decipher cellular circuitry, spatial relationships and molecular interactions following tissue injury.© 2023.

"36778591","Necroptosis in CNS diseases: Focus on astrocytes.","Front Aging Neurosci","In the last few years, necroptosis, a recently described type of cell death, has been reported to play an important role in the development of various brain pathologies. Necroptosis is a cell death mechanism that has morphological characteristics similar to necrosis but is mediated by fundamentally different molecular pathways. Necroptosis is initiated by signaling through the interaction of RIP1/RIP3/MLKL proteins (receptor-interacting protein kinase 1/receptor-interacting protein kinase 3/mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein). RIPK1 kinase is usually inactive under physiological conditions. It is activated by stimulation of death receptors (TNFR1, TNFR2, TLR3, and 4, Fas-ligand) by external signals. Phosphorylation of RIPK1 results in the formation of its complex with death receptors. Further, complexes with the second member of the RIP3 and MLKL cascade appear, and the necroptosome is formed. There is enough evidence that necroptosis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of brain ischemia and neurodegenerative diseases. In recent years, a point of view that both neurons and glial cells can play a key role in the development of the central nervous system (CNS) pathologies finds more and more confirmation. Astrocytes play complex roles during neurodegeneration and ischemic brain damage initiating both impair and protective processes. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that induce pathogenic activity of astrocytes remain veiled. In this review, we consider these processes in terms of the initiation of necroptosis. On the other hand, it is important to remember that like other types of programmed cell death, necroptosis plays an important role for the organism, as it induces a strong immune response and is involved in the control of cancerogenesis. In this review, we provide an overview of the complex role of necroptosis as an important pathogenetic component of neuronal and astrocyte death in neurodegenerative diseases, epileptogenesis, and ischemic brain damage.Copyright © 2023 Mitroshina, Saviuk and Vedunova."
"36769067","Astrocyte Immune Functions and Glaucoma.","Int J Mol Sci","Astrocytes, a non-neuronal glial cell type in the nervous system, are essential for regulating physiological functions of the central nervous system. In various injuries and diseases of the central nervous system, astrocytes often change their phenotypes into neurotoxic ones that participate in pro-inflammatory responses (hereafter referred to as ""immune functions""). Such astrocytic immune functions are not only limited to brain diseases but are also found in ocular neurodegenerative diseases such as glaucoma, a retinal neurodegenerative disease that is the leading cause of blindness worldwide. The eye has two astrocyte-lineage cells: astrocytes and Müller cells. They maintain the physiological environment of the retina and optic nerve, thereby controlling visual function. Dysfunction of astrocyte-lineage cells may be involved in the onset and progression of glaucoma. These cells become reactive in glaucoma patients, and animal studies have suggested that their immune responses may be linked to glaucoma-related events: tissue remodeling, neuronal death, and infiltration of peripheral immune cells. In this review, we discuss the role of the immune functions of astrocyte-lineage cells in the pathogenesis of glaucoma."

Mental health conditions are highly prevalent in many countries, and the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risk of further erosion of the mental well-being in the population. Therefore, it is relevant to assess the current status of the application of AI toward mental health research to inform about trends, gaps, opportunities, and challenges.This study aims to perform a systematic overview of AI applications in mental health in terms of methodologies, data, outcomes, performance, and quality.A systematic search in PubMed, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and Cochrane databases was conducted to collect records of use cases of AI for mental health disorder studies from January 2016 to November 2021. Records were screened for eligibility if they were a practical implementation of AI in clinical trials involving mental health conditions. Records of AI study cases were evaluated and categorized by the International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision (ICD-11). Data related to trial settings, collection methodology, features, outcomes, and model development and evaluation were extracted following the CHARMS (Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction Modelling Studies) guideline. Further, evaluation of risk of bias is provided.A total of 429 nonduplicated records were retrieved from the databases and 129 were included for a full assessment-18 of which were manually added. The distribution of AI applications in mental health was found unbalanced between ICD-11 mental health categories. Predominant categories were Depressive disorders (n=70) and Schizophrenia or other primary psychotic disorders (n=26). Most interventions were based on randomized controlled trials (n=62), followed by prospective cohorts (n=24) among observational studies. AI was typically applied to evaluate quality of treatments (n=44) or stratify patients into subgroups and clusters (n=31). Models usually applied a combination of questionnaires and scales to assess symptom severity using electronic health records (n=49) as well as medical images (n=33). Quality assessment revealed important flaws in the process of AI application and data preprocessing pipelines. One-third of the studies (n=56) did not report any preprocessing or data preparation. One-fifth of the models were developed by comparing several methods (n=35) without assessing their suitability in advance and a small proportion reported external validation (n=21). Only 1 paper reported a second assessment of a previous AI model. Risk of bias and transparent reporting yielded low scores due to a poor reporting of the strategy for adjusting hyperparameters, coefficients, and the explainability of the models. International collaboration was anecdotal (n=17) and data and developed models mostly remained private (n=126).These significant shortcomings, alongside the lack of information to ensure reproducibility and transparency, are indicative of the challenges that AI in mental health needs to face before contributing to a solid base for knowledge generation and for being a support tool in mental health management.©Roberto Tornero-Costa, Antonio Martinez-Millana, Natasha Azzopardi-Muscat, Ledia Lazeri, Vicente Traver, David Novillo-Ortiz.

A hidden Markov model approach was used to call CNVs.CNVs in schizophrenia cases were twice as large on average than CNVs in controls (p = 0.04). The analyses focused on extremely large >250 kilobases CNVs or homozygous deletions of any size. One extremely large deletion was noted in a single case (16.5 megabases on chromosome 10). Two cases had an 814 kb duplication of chromosome 7 spanning a cluster of genes, including circadian-related loci, and two other cases had 277 kb deletions of chromosome 9 encompassing an olfactory receptors gene family. CNVs were also seen in loci previously associated with schizophrenia, namely a 16p11 proximal duplication and two 22q11.2 deletions.Runs of homozygosity (ROHs) were analyzed across the genome to investigate correlation with schizophrenia risk.

We aimed to 1) evaluate the longitudinal change in the physical activity trajectory according to sex which is associated with age and to 2) determine the factors associated with the dynamic change in physical activity-related variables across a wide age range among Japanese adults. This longitudinal prospective study included 689 Japanese adults (3914 measurements) aged 26-85 years, whose physical activity data in at least two surveys were available. Physical activity-related variables, such as intensity (inactive, light [LPA; 1.5 to 2.9 metabolic equivalents (METs)], moderate-to-vigorous [MVPA; ≥3.0 METs]), total energy expenditure (TEE), physical activity level (PAL), and step count, were evaluated using a validated triaxial accelerometer. Statistical analysis involved the latent growth curve models and random-effect panel data multivariate regression analysis. During a mean follow-up period of 6.8 years, physical activity was assessed an average of 5.1 times in men and 5.9 times in women. The profiles for the inactive time, LPA (only men), MVPA, step count, PAL, and TEE showed clear curvature, indicating an accelerated rate of change around the age of 70. In contrast, other variables exhibited minimal or no curvature over the age span. The MVPA trajectory was positively associated with alcohol consumption, hand grips, leg power, and trunk flexibility and negatively associated with age, local area, body mass index (BMI), comorbidity score, and heart rate over time. Our results indicated that the physical activity trajectory revealed clear curvature, accelerated rate of change around the age of 70, and determined physical health and fitness and BMI as dynamic factors associated with physical activity changes. These findings may be useful to help support populations to achieve and maintain the recommended level of physical activity.Copyright: © 2023 Watanabe et al.

"36836673","Age-Related Changes in the Clustering of Blood Populations in Cynomolgus Monkeys Depend on Sex and Immune Status.","Life (Basel)","Non-anthropoid primates cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis), also known as crab-eating macaques, are increasingly used in biomedical and preclinical studies due to their evolutionary proximity to humans, sharing similar diets, infectious and senile diseases. Age-related changes and sexual dimorphism of the immune system of C. monkeys have not been sufficiently characterized in literature, though age and sex differences affect the course of diseases and sensitivity to medications. Aging in C. monkeys is accompanied by an increase in CD3+CD4+CD8+ (DP-T) cells, plasma B-cells, and a decrease in platelets. Erythromyeloid bias has also been noticed in older animals. There was an increase in eosinophils, haematocrit (HCT) and haemoglobin concentration (HGB). Senile decline in the function of the immune system had sex differences. An increase in the number of monocytes, cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTL) and a decrease in the T-helper population were more pronounced in older females. A significant reduction in the number of B-cells and activated T-cells was detected in males only. A moderate correlation with the regression model of aging was established for DP-T, HCT and HGB. The reduction in the B cells count in males and the increase in CTL level in females are moderately correlated with age. Other blood cell populations did not show significant correlations in the regression models due to their high sample variability. The novel cell population CD3-CD20loCD16/CD56+, presumably NK-cells subset, was revealed. This cell population demonstrated an increase trend with age in both sexes. Population-statistical age norms for different sexes for young and very old macaques were established. The blood population clusters associated with sex and immune status in older animals were also identified."

This prospective cohort study aimed to assess differences in the incidence and course of reported AEFIs after COVID-19 vaccination between males and females in the Netherlands and provides a summary of sex-disaggregated outcomes in published literature.Patient reported outcomes of AEFIs over a six month period following the first vaccination with BioNTech-Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Moderna or the Johnson&Johnson vaccine were collected in a Cohort Event Monitoring study. Logistic regression was used to assess differences in incidence of 'any AEFI', local reactions and the top ten most reported AEFIs between the sexes. Effects of age, vaccine brand, comorbidities, prior COVID-19 infection and the use of antipyretic drugs were analyzed as well. Also, time-to-onset, time-to-recovery and perceived burden of AEFIs was compared between the sexes. Third, a literature review was done to retrieve sex-disaggregated outcomes of COVID-19 vaccination.The cohort included 27,540 vaccinees (38.5% males). Females showed around two-fold higher odds of having any AEFI as compared to males with most pronounced differences after the first dose and for nausea and injection site inflammation. Age was inversely associated with AEFI incidence, whereas a prior COVID-19 infection, the use of antipyretic drugs and several comorbidities were positively associated. The perceived burden of AEFIs and time-to-recovery were slightly higher in females.The results of this large cohort study correspond to existing evidence and contribute to the knowledge gain necessary to disentangle the magnitude of the effect sex in response to vaccination. Whilst females have a significant higher probability of experiencing an AEFI than males, we observed that the course and burden is only to a minor extent different between the sexes.Copyright © 2023 Duijster, Lieber, Pacelli, Van Balveren, Ruijs, Raethke, Kant and Van Hunsel."
"36793337","Sex hormone influence on female-biased autoimmune diseases hints at puberty as an important factor in pathogenesis.","Front Pediatr","The majority of autoimmune diseases affect more women than men, suggesting an important role for sex hormones in regulating immune response. Current research supports this idea, highlighting the importance of sex hormones in both immune and metabolic regulation. Puberty is characterized by drastic changes in sex hormone levels and metabolism. These pubertal changes may be what forms the gulf between men and women in sex bias towards autoimmunity. In this review, a current perspective on pubertal immunometabolic changes and their impact on the pathogenesis of a select group of autoimmune diseases is presented. SLE, RA, JIA, SS, and ATD were focused on in this review for their notable sex bias and prevalence. Due to both the scarcity of pubertal autoimmune data and the differences in mechanism or age-of-onset in juvenile analogues often beginning prior to pubertal changes, data on the connection between the specific adult autoimmune diseases and puberty often relies on sex hormone influence in pathogenesis and established sex differences in immunity that begin during puberty.© 2023 Yang, Kennicott, Zhu, Kim, Wakefield, Studener, Liang."

Numerous computational methods now exist for analyzing single-cell data and identifying cell states. These methods mostly rely on the expression of genes considered as markers for a given cell state. Yet, there is a lack of scRNA-seq computational tools to study the evolution of cell states, particularly how cell states change their molecular profiles. This can include novel gene activation or the novel deployment of programs already existing in other cell types, known as co-option.Here we present scEvoNet, a Python tool for predicting cell type evolution in cross-species or cancer-related scRNA-seq datasets. ScEvoNet builds the confusion matrix of cell states and a bipartite network connecting genes and cell states. It allows a user to obtain a set of genes shared by the characteristic signature of two cell states even between distantly-related datasets. These genes can be used as indicators of either evolutionary divergence or co-option occurring during organism or tumor evolution. Our results on cancer and developmental datasets indicate that scEvoNet is a helpful tool for the initial screening of such genes as well as for measuring cell state similarities.The scEvoNet package is implemented in Python and is freely available from https://github.com/monsoro/scEvoNet . Utilizing this framework and exploring the continuum of transcriptome states between developmental stages and species will help explain cell state dynamics.© 2023. The Author(s)."

However, it is not clear how trafficking of mitochondria, essential for RGC growth and maturation, changes during RGC development. The purpose of this study was to understand the dynamics and regulation of mitochondrial transport during RGC maturation using acutely purified RGCs as a model system.Primary RGCs were immunopanned from rats of either sex during three stages of development. MitoTracker dye and live-cell imaging were used to quantify mitochondrial motility. Analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing was used to identify Kinesin family member 5A (Kif5a) as a relevant motor candidate for mitochondrial transport. Kif5a expression was manipulated with either short hairpin RNA (shRNA) or exogenous expression adeno-associated virus viral vectors.Anterograde and retrograde mitochondrial trafficking and motility decreased through RGC development. Similarly, the expression of Kif5a, a motor protein that transports mitochondria, also decreased during development. Kif5a knockdown decreased anterograde mitochondrial transport, while Kif5a expression increased general mitochondrial motility and anterograde mitochondrial transport.Our results suggested that Kif5a directly regulates mitochondrial axonal transport in developing RGCs. Future work exploring the role of Kif5a in vivo in RGCs is indicated."

Profiling individual cells within the tumor tissues is crucial to characterize the tumor microenvironment and its therapeutic implications. Since single-cell technologies are still not cost-effective, scientists have developed many statistical deconvolution methods to delineate cellular characteristics from bulk transcriptome data. Here, we present an overview of 20 deconvolution techniques, including cutting-edge techniques recently established. We categorized deconvolution techniques by three primary criteria: characteristics of methodology, use of prior knowledge of cell types and outcome of the methods. We highlighted the advantage of the recent deconvolution tools that are based on probabilistic models. Moreover, we illustrated two scenarios of the common application of deconvolution methods to study tumor microenvironments. This comprehensive review will serve as a guideline for the researchers to select the appropriate method for their application of deconvolution."

The identification of spatially variable genes (SVGs) is an essential step for downstream spatial domain characterization. Although several methods have been proposed for identifying SVGs, inadequate ability to decipher spatial domains, poor efficiency, and insufficient interoperability with existing standard analysis workflows still impede the applications of these methods. Here we propose SINFONIA, a scalable method for identifying spatially variable genes via ensemble strategies. Implemented in Python, SINFONIA can be seamlessly integrated into existing analysis workflows. Using 15 spatial transcriptomic datasets generated with different protocols and with different sizes, dimensions and qualities, we show the advantage of SINFONIA over three baseline methods and two variants via systematic evaluation of spatial clustering, domain resolution, latent representation, spatial visualization, and computational efficiency with 21 quantitative metrics. Additionally, SINFONIA is robust relative to the choice of the number of SVGs. We anticipate SINFONIA will facilitate the analysis of spatial transcriptomics."

However, while it is recognized that different tissues have distinct tRNA profiles and codon usages in their transcriptomes, the effect of tissue-specific codon optimality on protein synthesis remains elusive.We leverage existing state-of-the-art transcriptomics and proteomics datasets from the GTEx project and the Human Protein Atlas to compute the protein-to-mRNA ratios of 36 human tissues. Using this as a proxy of translational efficiency, we build a machine learning model that identifies codons enriched or depleted in specific tissues. We detect two clusters of tissues with an opposite pattern of codon preferences. We then use these identified patterns for the development of CUSTOM, a codon optimizer algorithm which suggests a synonymous codon design in order to optimize protein production in a tissue-specific manner. In human cell-line models, we provide evidence that codon optimization should take into account particularities of the translational machinery of the tissues in which the target proteins are expressed and that our approach can design genes with tissue-optimized expression profiles.We provide proof-of-concept evidence that codon preferences exist in tissue-specific protein synthesis and demonstrate its application to synthetic gene design. We show that CUSTOM can be of benefit in biological and biotechnological applications, such as in the design of tissue-targeted therapies and vaccines.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36814837","A cross entropy test allows quantitative statistical comparison of t-SNE and UMAP representations.","Cell Rep Methods","The advent of high-dimensional single-cell data has necessitated the development of dimensionality-reduction tools. t-Distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) are the two most frequently used approaches, allowing clear visualization of complex single-cell datasets. Despite the need for quantitative comparison, t-SNE and UMAP have largely remained visualization tools due to the lack of robust statistical approaches. Here, we have derived a statistical test for evaluating the difference between dimensionality-reduced datasets using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test on the distributions of cross entropy of single cells within each dataset. As the approach uses the inter-relationship of single cells for comparison, the resulting statistic is robust and capable of identifying true biological variation. Further, the test provides a valid distance between single-cell datasets, allowing the organization of multiple samples into a dendrogram for quantitative comparison of complex datasets.

However, its full potential for precision medicine has yet to be reached. Towards this, we propose A Single-cell Guided Pipeline to Aid Repurposing of Drugs (ASGARD) that defines a drug score to recommend drugs by considering all cell clusters to address the intercellular heterogeneity within each patient. ASGARD shows significantly better average accuracy on single-drug therapy compared to two bulk-cell-based drug repurposing methods. We also demonstrated that it performs considerably better than other cell cluster-level predicting methods. In addition, we validate ASGARD using the drug response prediction method TRANSACT with Triple-Negative-Breast-Cancer patient samples. We find that many top-ranked drugs are either approved by the Food and Drug Administration or in clinical trials treating corresponding diseases.

Based on the concept that these data are often best described as continuous mixtures of cells or molecules, we present a computational framework for the transfer of annotations to cells and their combinations (TACCO), which consists of an optimal transport model extended with different wrappers to annotate a wide variety of data. We apply TACCO to identify cell types and states, decipher spatiomolecular tissue structure at the cell and molecular level and resolve differentiation trajectories using synthetic and biological datasets. While matching or exceeding the accuracy of specialized tools for the individual tasks, TACCO reduces the computational requirements by up to an order of magnitude and scales to larger datasets (for example, considering the runtime of annotation transfer for 1 M simulated dropout observations).© 2023.

The increasing abundance of data requires new theoretical and computational frameworks for understanding cell fate determination, accurately classifying cell fates from expression data, and integrating knowledge from cell atlases. Here, we present single-cell Type Order Parameters (scTOP): a statistical-physics-inspired approach for constructing ""order parameters"" for cell fate given a reference basis of cell types. scTOP can quickly and accurately classify cells at a single-cell resolution, generate interpretable visualizations of developmental trajectories, and assess the fidelity of engineered cells. Importantly, scTOP does this without using feature selection, statistical fitting, or dimensional reduction (e.g., UMAP, PCA, etc.). We illustrate the power of scTOP utilizing a wide variety of human and mouse datasets (bothin vivoandin vitro). By reanalyzing mouse lung alveolar development data, we characterize a transient perinatal hybrid alveolar type 1/alveolar type 2 (AT1/AT2) cell population that disappears by 15 days post-birth and show that it is transcriptionally distinct from previously identified adult AT2-to-AT1 transitional cell types. Visualizations of lineage tracing data on hematopoiesis using scTOP confirm that a single clone can give rise to as many as three distinct differentiated cell types. We also show how scTOP can quantitatively assess the transcriptional similarity between endogenous and transplanted cells in the context of murine pulmonary cell transplantation. Finally, we provide an easy-to-use Python implementation of scTOP. Our results suggest that physics-inspired order parameters can be an important tool for understanding development and characterizing engineered cells."

Gene co-expression estimation is an essential step in this direction. It can annotate functionalities of unknown genes or construct the basis of gene regulatory network inference. This study thoroughly tests the existing gene co-expression estimation methods on simulation datasets with known ground truth co-expression networks. We generate these novel datasets using two simulation processes that use the parameters learned from the experimental data. We demonstrate that these simulations better capture the underlying properties of the real-world single-cell datasets than previously tested simulations for the task. Our performance results on tens of simulated and eight experimental datasets show that all methods produce estimations with a high false discovery rate potentially caused by high-sparsity levels in the data. Finally, we find that commonly used pre-processing approaches, such as normalization and imputation, do not improve the co-expression estimation.

The graph-based correlation method assigns each cell a localLindex, pinpointing specific cell groups of certain regulatory states. Such single-cell resolved regulatory state information enables the heterogeneity analysis equipped in the package. Applying scGREAT to the 10X Multiome PBMC dataset, we demonstrated how it could help subcluster cell types, infer regulation-based pseudo-time trajectory, discover feature modules, and find cluster-specific regulatory gene-peak pairs.

"36711528","ConDoR: Tumor phylogeny inference with a copy-number constrained mutation loss model.","bioRxiv","Tumors consist of subpopulations of cells that harbor distinct collections of somatic mutations. These mutations range in scale from single nucleotide variants (SNVs) to large-scale copy-number aberrations (CNAs). While many approaches infer tumor phylogenies using SNVs as phylogenetic markers, CNAs that overlap SNVs may lead to erroneous phylogenetic inference. Specifically, an SNV may be lost in a cell due to a deletion of the genomic segment containing the SNV. Unfortunately, no current single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq) technology produces accurate measurements of both SNVs and CNAs. For instance, recenttargetedscDNA-seq technologies, such as Mission Bio Tapestri, measure SNVs with high fidelity in individual cells, but yield much less reliable measurements of CNAs. We introduce a new evolutionary model, theconstrained k-Dollo model, that uses SNVs as phylogenetic markers and partial information about CNAs in the form of clustering of cells with similar copy-number profiles. This copy-number clustering constrains where loss of SNVs can occur in the phylogeny. We develop ConDoR (Constrained Dollo Reconstruction), an algorithm to infer tumor phylogenies from targeted scDNA-seq data using the constrainedk-Dollo model. We show that ConDoR outperforms existing methods on simulated data. We use ConDoR to analyze a new multi-region targeted scDNA-seq dataset of 2153 cells from a pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumor and produce a more plausible phylogeny compared to existing methods that conforms to histological results for the tumor from a previous study. We also analyze a metastatic colorectal cancer dataset, deriving a more parsimonious phylogeny than previously published analyses and with a simpler monoclonal origin of metastasis compared to the original study.Software is available at https://github.com/raphael-group/constrained-Dollo."

We describe scTriangulate, a computational framework to mix-and-match multiple clustering results, modalities, associated algorithms, and resolutions to achieve an optimal solution. Rather than ensemble approaches which select the ""consensus"", scTriangulate picks the most stable solution through coalitional iteration. When evaluated on diverse multimodal technologies, scTriangulate outperforms alternative approaches to identify high-confidence cell-populations and modality-specific subtypes. Unlike existing integration strategies that rely on modality-specific joint embedding or geometric graphs, scTriangulate makes no assumption about the distributions of raw underlying values. As a result, this approach can solve unprecedented integration challenges, including the ability to automate reference cell-atlas construction, resolve clonal architecture within molecularly defined cell-populations and subdivide clusters to discover splicing-defined disease subtypes. scTriangulate is a flexible strategy for unified integration of single-cell or multimodal clustering solutions, from nearly unlimited sources.© 2023.

Considerable insight has emerged from studies on presumed monogenic blood disorders, which continue to provide key insights into the mechanisms critical for hematopoiesis. Furthermore, the emergence of large-scale biobanks and cohorts has uncovered thousands of genomic loci associated with blood cell traits and diseases. Some of these blood cell trait-associated loci act as modifiers of what were once thought to be monogenic blood diseases. However, most of these loci await functional validation. Here, we discuss the validation bottleneck and emerging methods to more effectively connect variant to function.

However, their performance has not been evaluated extensively in single-cell eQTL analysis, especially for different cell types. Potential challenges arise due to the structure of single-cell RNA-seq data, including sparsity, skewness, and mean-variance relationship. Here, we show by a series of analyses that PEER and PCA require additional quality control and data transformation steps on the pseudo-bulk matrix to obtain valid latent variables; otherwise, it can result in highly correlated factors (Pearson's correlation r = 0.63 ~ 0.99). Incorporating valid PFs/PCs in the eQTL association model would identify 1.7 ~ 13.3% more eGenes. Sensitivity analysis showed that the pattern of change between the number of eGenes detected and fitted PFs/PCs varied significantly in different cell types. In addition, using highly variable genes to generate latent variables could achieve similar eGenes discovery power as using all genes but save considerable computational resources (~ 6.2-fold faster).© 2023.

Given the widespread use of ICB and the critical role hematopoietic stem cell-derived lymphocytes play in mediating antitumor responses, CH may be associated with therapeutic efficacy and hematologic toxicity.To determine the association between CH and outcomes, hematologic toxicity, and therapeutic efficacy in patients with metastatic gastrointestinal tract cancers being treated with systemic therapy, both in the first-line metastatic treatment setting and in ICB.This retrospective cohort study included 633 patients with stage IV colorectal (CRC) and esophagogastric (EGC) cancer who were treated with first-line chemotherapy and/or ICB at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Patients underwent matched tumor and peripheral blood DNA sequencing using the Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets next-generation sequencing assay between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2020.Clonal hematopoiesis-related genetic alterations were identified by next-generation sequencing of patients' tumor and normal blood buffy coat samples, with a subset of these CH alterations annotated as likely putative drivers (CH-PD) based upon previously established criteria.Patients with CH and CH-PD in peripheral blood samples were identified, and these findings were correlated with survival outcomes (progression-free survival [PFS] and overall survival [OS]) during first-line chemotherapy and ICB, as well as baseline white blood cell levels and the need for granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support.Among the 633 patients included in the study (390 men [61.6%]; median age, 58 [IQR, 48-66] years), the median age was 52 (IQR, 45-63) years in the CRC group and 61 (IQR, 53-69) years in the EGC group. In the CRC group, 161 of 301 patients (53.5%) were men, compared with 229 of 332 patients (69.0%) in the EGC group. Overall, 62 patients (9.8%) were Asian, 45 (7.1%) were Black or African American, 482 (76.1%) were White, and 44 (7.0%) were of unknown race or ethnicity. Presence of CH was identified in 115 patients with EGC (34.6%) and 83 with CRC (27.6%), with approximately half of these patients harboring CH-PD (CRC group, 44 of 83 [53.0%]; EGC group, 55 of 115 [47.8%]). Patients with EGC and CH-PD exhibited a significantly worse median OS of 16.0 (95% CI, 11.6-22.3) months compared with 21.6 (95% CI, 19.6-24.3) months for those without CH-PD (P = .01). For patients with CRC and EGC, CH and CH-PD were not associated with PFS differences in patients undergoing ICB or first-line chemotherapy.

OncogenicIDH1/2mutations confer neomorphic activity, leading to the production of D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2-HG), a potent inhibitor of α-KG-dependent enzymes which include the TET methylcytosine dioxygenases. Given their mutual exclusivity in myeloid neoplasms,IDH1,IDH2, andTET2mutations may converge on a common oncogenic mechanism. Contrary to this expectation, we observed that they have distinct, and even opposite, effects on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in genetically engineered mice. Epigenetic and single-cell transcriptomic analyses revealed thatIdh2R172KandTet2loss-of-function have divergent consequences on the expression and activity of key hematopoietic and leukemogenic regulators. Notably, chromatin accessibility and transcriptional deregulation inIdh2R172Kcells were partially disconnected from DNA methylation alterations. These results highlight unanticipated divergent effects ofIDH1/2andTET2mutations, providing support for the optimization of genotype-specific therapies."

"36831115","The Current Therapeutic Role of Chromatin Remodeling for the Prognosis and Treatment of Heart Failure.","Biomedicines","Cardiovascular diseases are a major cause of death globally, with no cure to date. Many interventions have been studied and suggested, of which epigenetics and chromatin remodeling have been the most promising. Over the last decade, major advancements have been made in the field of chromatin remodeling, particularly for the treatment of heart failure, because of innovations in bioinformatics and gene therapy. Specifically, understanding changes to the chromatin architecture have been shown to alter cardiac disease progression via variations in genomic sequencing, targeting cardiac genes, using RNA molecules, and utilizing chromatin remodeler complexes. By understanding these chromatin remodeling mechanisms in an injured heart, treatments for heart failure have been suggested through individualized pharmaceutical interventions as well as biomarkers for major disease states. By understanding the current roles of chromatin remodeling in heart failure, a potential therapeutic approach may be discovered in the future."
"36778892","Personalizing treatments for patients based on cardiovascular phenotyping.","Expert Rev Precis Med Drug Dev","Cardiovascular disease persists as the leading cause of death worldwide despite continued advances in diagnostics and therapeutics. Our current approach to patients with cardiovascular disease is rooted in reductionism, which presupposes that all patients share a similar phenotype and will respond the same to therapy; however, this is unlikely as cardiovascular diseases exhibit complex heterogeneous phenotypes.With the advent of high-throughput platforms for omics testing, phenotyping cardiovascular diseases has advanced to incorporate large-scale molecular data with classical history, physical examination, and laboratory results. Findings from genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics profiling have been used to define more precise cardiovascular phenotypes and predict adverse outcomes in population-based and disease-specific patient cohorts. These molecular data have also been utilized to inform drug efficacy based on a patient's unique phenotype.Multiscale phenotyping of cardiovascular disease has revealed diversity among patients that can be used to personalize pharmacotherapies and predict outcomes. Nonetheless, precision phenotyping for cardiovascular disease remains a nascent field that has not yet translated into widespread clinical practice despite its many potential advantages for patient care. Future endeavors that demonstrate improved pharmacotherapeutic responses and associated reduction in adverse events will facilitate mainstream adoption of precision cardiovascular phenotyping."
"36869227","Neighborhood deprivation, racial segregation and associations with cancer risk and outcomes across the cancer-control continuum.","Mol Psychiatry","The racial/ethnic disparities in cancer incidence and outcome are partially due to the inequities in neighborhood advantage. Mounting evidences supported a link between neighborhood deprivation and cancer outcomes including higher mortality. In this review, we discuss some of the findings related to work on area-level neighborhood variables and cancer outcomes, and the potential biological and built/natural environmental mechanisms that might explain this link. Studies have also shown that residents of deprived neighborhoods or of racially or economically segregated neighborhoods have worse health outcomes than residents of more affluent neighborhoods and/or less racially or economically segregated neighborhoods, even after adjusting for the individual-level socioeconomic status. To date, little research has been conducted investigating the biological mediators that may play roles in the associations of neighborhood deprivation and segregation with cancer outcomes. The psychophysiological stress induced by neighborhood disadvantage among people living in these neighborhoods could be a potential underlying biological mechanism. We examined a number of chronic stress-related pathways that may potentially mediate the relationship between area-level neighborhood factors and cancer outcomes, including higher allostatic load, stress hormones, altered epigenome and telomere maintenance and biological aging. In conclusion, the extant evidence supports the notion that neighborhood deprivation and racial segregation have unfavorable impacts on cancer. Understanding how neighborhood factors influence the biological stress response has the potential to inform where and what types of resources are needed within the community to improve cancer outcomes and reduce disparities. More studies are warranted to directly assess the role of biological and social mechanisms in mediating the relationship between neighborhood factors and cancer outcomes.© 2023.

"36845417","Restoring the missing person to personalized medicine and precision psychiatry.","Front Neurosci","Precision psychiatry has emerged as part of the shift to personalized medicine and builds on frameworks such as the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), multilevel biological ""omics"" data and, most recently, computational psychiatry. The shift is prompted by the realization that a one-size-fits all approach is inadequate to guide clinical care because people differ in ways that are not captured by broad diagnostic categories. One of the first steps in developing this personalized approach to treatment was the use of genetic markers to guide pharmacotherapeutics based on predictions of pharmacological response or non-response, and the potential risk of adverse drug reactions. Advances in technology have made a greater degree of specificity or precision potentially more attainable. To date, however, the search for precision has largely focused on biological parameters. Psychiatric disorders involve multi-level dynamics that require measures of phenomenological, psychological, behavioral, social structural, and cultural dimensions. This points to the need to develop more fine-grained analyses of experience, self-construal, illness narratives, interpersonal interactional dynamics, and social contexts and determinants of health. In this paper, we review the limitations of precision psychiatry arguing that it cannot reach its goal if it does not include core elements of the processes that give rise to psychopathological states, which include the agency and experience of the person. Drawing from contemporary systems biology, social epidemiology, developmental psychology, and cognitive science, we propose a cultural-ecosocial approach to integrating precision psychiatry with person-centered care.Copyright © 2023 Gómez-Carrillo, Paquin, Dumas and Kirmayer."

How PNMA proteins trigger a severe autoimmune disease is unclear.PNMAgenes are predominately expressed in the central nervous system with little known functions but are ectopically expressed in some tumors. Here, we show thatPNMA2is derived from a Ty3 retrotransposon that encodes a protein which forms virus-like capsids released from cells as non-enveloped particles. Recombinant PNMA2 capsids injected into mice induce a robust autoimmune reaction with significant generation of autoantibodies that preferentially bind external ""spike"" PNMA2 capsid epitopes, while capsid-assembly-defective PNMA2 protein is not immunogenic. PNMA2 autoantibodies present in cerebrospinal fluid of patients with anti-Ma2 paraneoplastic neurologic disease show similar preferential binding to PNMA2 ""spike"" capsid epitopes. These observations suggest that PNMA2 capsids released from tumors trigger an autoimmune response that underlies Ma2 paraneoplastic neurological syndrome."

These capacities are tightly linked to an increase in the size and connectivity of the cerebral cortex, which is thought to have resulted from evolutionary changes in the mechanisms of cortical development. Convergent progress in evolutionary genomics, developmental biology and neuroscience has recently enabled the identification of genomic changes that act as human-specific modifiers of cortical development. These modifiers influence most aspects of corticogenesis, from the timing and complexity of cortical neurogenesis to synaptogenesis and the assembly of cortical circuits.

"36741116","The evolutionary origin of psychosis.","Front Psychiatry","Imagination, the driving force of creativity, and primary psychosis are human-specific, since we do not observe behaviors in other species that would convincingly suggest they possess the same traits. Both these traits have been linked to the function of the prefrontal cortex, which is the most evolutionarily novel region of the human brain. A number of evolutionarily novel genetic and epigenetic changes that determine the human brain-specific structure and function have been discovered in recent years. Among them are genomic loci subjected to increased rates of single nucleotide substitutions in humans, called human accelerated regions. These mostly regulatory regions are involved in brain development and sometimes contain genetic variants that confer a risk for schizophrenia. On the other hand, neuroimaging data suggest that mind wandering and related phenomena (as a proxy of imagination) are in many ways similar to rapid eye movement dreaming, a function also present in non-human species. Furthermore, both functions are similar to psychosis in several ways: for example, the same brain areas are activated both in dreams and visual hallucinations. In the present Perspective we hypothesize that imagination is an evolutionary adaptation of dreaming, while primary psychosis results from deficient control by higher-order brain areas over imagination. In the light of this, human accelerated regions might be one of the key drivers in evolution of human imagination and the pathogenesis of psychotic disorders.Copyright © 2023 Levchenko, Gusev and Rogaev."
"36638273","A Human-Specific De Novo Gene Promotes Cortical Expansion and Folding.","Adv Sci (Weinh)","Newly originated de novo genes have been linked to the formation and function of the human brain. However, how a specific gene originates from ancestral noncoding DNAs and becomes involved in the preexisting network for functional outcomes remains elusive. Here, a human-specific de novo gene, SP0535, is identified that is preferentially expressed in the ventricular zone of the human fetal brain and plays an important role in cortical development and function. In human embryonic stem cell-derived cortical organoids, knockout of SP0535 compromises their growth and neurogenesis. In SP0535 transgenic (TG) mice, expression of SP0535 induces fetal cortex expansion and sulci and gyri-like structure formation. The progenitors and neurons in the SP0535 TG mouse cortex tend to proliferate and differentiate in ways that are unique to humans. SP0535 TG adult mice also exhibit improved cognitive ability and working memory. Mechanistically, SP0535 interacts with the membrane protein Na+/K+ATPase subunit alpha-1 (ATP1A1) and releases Src from the ATP1A1-Src complex, allowing increased level of Src phosphorylation that promotes cell proliferation. Thus, SP0535 is the first proven human-specific de novo gene that promotes cortical expansion and folding, and can function through incorporating into an existing conserved molecular network.© 2023 The Authors.

Mendelian randomization approaches can help control for such confounding.SCALLOP Consortium data of 19,195 participants were used to generate an FGF-23 genetic score. Data from 337,448 UK Biobank participants were used to estimate associations between higher genetically predicted FGF-23 concentration and the odds of any atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (n=26,266 events), nonatherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (n=12,652), and noncardiovascular diseases previously linked to FGF-23. Measurements of carotid intima-media thickness and left ventricular mass were available in a subset. Associations with cardiovascular outcomes were also tested in three large case-control consortia: CARDIOGRAMplusC4D (coronary artery disease, n=181,249 cases), MEGASTROKE (stroke, n=34,217), and HERMES (heart failure, n=47,309).We identified 34 independent variants for circulating FGF-23, which formed a validated genetic score. There were no associations between genetically predicted FGF-23 and any of the cardiovascular or noncardiovascular outcomes. In UK Biobank, the odds ratio (OR) for any atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease per 1-SD higher genetically predicted logFGF-23 was 1.03 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.98 to 1.08), and for any nonatherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, it was 1.01 (95% CI, 0.94 to 1.09). The ORs in the case-control consortia were 1.00 (95% CI, 0.97 to 1.03) for coronary artery disease, 1.01 (95% CI, 0.95 to 1.07) for stroke, and 1.00 (95% CI, 0.95 to 1.05) for heart failure. In those with imaging, logFGF-23 was not associated with carotid or cardiac abnormalities.Genetically predicted FGF-23 levels are not associated with atherosclerotic and nonatherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, suggesting no important causal link.This article contains a podcast at https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/www.asn-online.org/media/podcast/CJASN/2023_01_10_CJN05080422.mp3.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

Literature was non-systematically assessed and reviewed for suitability by the authors. For the selection phase, we describe current eligibility criteria for screening, along with their limitations and potential refinements through advanced clinical scores and biomarker assessments. For LC screening, we discuss how the accuracy of computerized tomography (CT) scan reading might be augmented by IT tools, helping radiologists to cope with increasing workloads. For PN management, we evaluate the precision of follow-up scans by semi-automatic volume measurements of CT-detected PN. Moreover, we present an integrative approach to evaluate the probability of PN malignancy to enable safe decisions on further management. As a clear limitation, additional validation studies are required for most innovative diagnostic approaches presented in this article, but the integration of clinical risk models, current imaging techniques, and advancing biomarker research has the potential to improve the LC screening performance generally."

However, this process becomes increasingly difficult as the number of target proteases increases because most substrates are promiscuously cleaved by multiple proteases. We introduce a method-substrate libraries for compressed sensing of enzymes (SLICE)-for selecting libraries of promiscuous substrates that classify protease mixtures (1) without deconvolution of compressed signals and (2) without highly specific substrates. SLICE ranks substrate libraries using a compression score (C), which quantifies substrate orthogonality and protease coverage. This metric is predictive of classification accuracy across 140in silico(Pearsonr = 0.71) and 55in vitrolibraries (r = 0.55). Using SLICE, we select a two-substrate library to classify 28 samples containing 11 enzymes in plasma (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] = 0.93). We envision that SLICE will enable the selection of libraries that capture information from hundreds of enzymes using fewer substrates for applications like activity-based sensors for imaging and diagnostics.© 2022 The Authors."

The detection of differing size patterns, termed fragmentomics, exploits information about the nucleosomal packing of DNA. Fragmentomics not only implies size pattern characterization but also considers the positioning and occupancy of nucleosomes, which result in cirDNA fragments being protected and persisting in the circulation. Fragmentomics can determine tissue of origin and distinguish cancer-derived cirDNA. The screening power of fragmentomics has been considerably strengthened in the omics era, as shown in the ongoing development of sophisticated technologies assisted by machine learning. Fragmentomics can thus be regarded as a strategy for characterizing cancer within individuals and offers an alternative or a synergistic supplement to mutation searches, methylation, or nucleosome positioning. As such, it offers potential for improving diagnostics and cancer screening.© 2022 The Author(s)."

Moreover, many liquid biopsy strategies being developed for early detection of cancer lack the sensitivity required to detect early-stage cancers. Early detection is key for improved quality of life, survival, and to reduce the financial burden of cancer treatments which are greater at later stage detection. This review examines the current liquid biopsy market, focusing in particular on the strengths and drawbacks of techniques in achieving early cancer detection.

Consequently, the genetically unstable cells contribute to intratumoral genetic heterogeneity and phenotypic diversity of cancer. These genetic alterations can be detected by several diagnostic techniques of molecular biology and the detection of alteration in genomic integrity may serve as reliable genetic molecular markers for the early detection of cancer or cancer-related abnormal changes in the body cells. These genetic molecular markers can detect cancer earlier than any other method of cancer diagnosis, once a tumor is diagnosed, then replacement or therapeutic manipulation of these cancer-related abnormal genetic changes can be possible, which leads toward effective and target-specific cancer treatment and in many cases, personalized treatment of cancer could be performed without the adverse effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

There is little information on maternal-fetal transmission of messages which influence fetal growth. We analyzed adipocyte-derived small extracellular vesicular (ADsEV) microRNAs in maternal and cord blood to explore their adipogenic potential. Methods We studied 127 mother-neonate pairs (51 lean and 76 adipose neonates, in 68 NGT and 59 GDM pregnancies). Adiposity refers to the highest tertile (T3) of sum of skinfolds in neonates of normal glucose tolerant (NGT) mothers, lean to the to lowest tertile (T1). ADsEV miRNAs from maternal and cord blood samples were profiled on Agilent 8*60K microarray. Differential expression (DE) of ADsEV miRNAs in adipose vs. lean neonates was studied before and after adjustment for maternal gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), adiposity, and vitamin B12-folate status. Results Multiple miRNAs were common in maternal and cord blood and positively correlated. We identified 24 maternal and 5 cord blood miRNAs differentially expressed (p ≤ 0.1) in the adipose neonate group, and 19 and 26 respectively, in the adjusted analyses. Even though DE miRNAs were different in maternal and cord blood, they targeted similar adipogenic pathways (e.g., the forkhead box O (FOXO) family of transcription factors, mitogen‑activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) pathway). Maternal GDM and adiposity were associated with many DE ADsEV miRNAs. Conclusion Our results suggest that the ADsEV miRNAs in mothers are potential regulators of fetal adiposity. The expression and functionality of miRNAs appears to be influenced by maternal adiposity, hyperglycemia, and micronutrient status during pregnancy."

Its histopathological classification as muscle invasive (MIBC) and non-muscle invasive (NMIBC) is the most prominent aspect, affecting the prognosis and progression of this disease. In this study, we defined the active regulatory landscape of MIBC and NMIBC cell lines using H3K27ac ChIP-seq and used an integrative approach to combine our findings with existing data. Our analysis revealed FRA1 and FLI1 as two critical transcription factors differentially regulating MIBC regulatory landscape. We show that FRA1 and FLI1 regulate the genes involved in epithelial cell migration and cell junction organization. Knock-down of FRA1 and FLI1 in MIBC revealed the downregulation of several EMT-related genes such as MAP4K4 and FLOT1. Further, ChIP-SICAP performed for FRA1 and FLI1 enabled us to infer chromatin binding partners of these transcription factors and link this information with their target genes. Finally, we show that knock-down of FRA1 and FLI1 result in significant reduction of invasion capacity of MIBC cells towards muscle microenvironment using IC-CHIP assays. Our results collectively highlight the role of these transcription factors in selection and design of targeted options for treatment of MIBC.© 2023. The Author(s)."

This is not surprising given the work from multiple laboratories using cell and animal models that have established that Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 L-type calcium channels (LTCCs), encoded byCACNA1CandCACNA1D, respectively, play a key role in various neuronal processes that are essential for normal brain development, connectivity, and experience-dependent plasticity. Of the multiple genetic aberrations reported, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) inCACNA1CandCACNA1Dthat are present within introns, in accordance with the growing body of literature establishing that large numbers of SNPs associated with complex diseases, including neuropsychiatric disorders, are present within non-coding regions. How these intronic SNPs affect gene expression has remained a question. Here, we review recent studies that are beginning to shed light on how neuropsychiatric-linked non-coding genetic variants can impact gene expression via regulation at the genomic and chromatin levels. We additionally review recent studies that are uncovering how altered calcium signaling through LTCCs impact some of the neuronal developmental processes, such as neurogenesis, neuron migration, and neuron differentiation. Together, the described changes in genomic regulation and disruptions in neurodevelopment provide possible mechanisms by which genetic variants of LTCC genes contribute to neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders."

Despite the clinical and social importance of prenatal alcohol use, limited routinely collected information or epidemiological data exists in Canada. The aim of this study was to pool data from multiple Canadian cohort studies to identify sociodemographic characteristics before and during pregnancy that were associated with alcohol consumption during pregnancy and to assess the impact of different patterns of alcohol use on birth outcomes.We harmonized information collected (e.g., pregnant women's alcohol intake, infants' gestational age and birth weight) from five Canadian pregnancy cohort studies to consolidate a large sample (n = 11,448). Risk factors for any alcohol use during pregnancy, including any alcohol use prior to pregnancy recognition, and binge drinking, were estimated using binomial regressions including fixed effects of pregnancy cohort membership and multiple maternal risk factors. Impacts of alcohol use during pregnancy on birth outcomes (preterm birth and low birth weight for gestational) were also estimated using binomial regression models.In analyses adjusting for multiple risk factors, women's alcohol use during pregnancy, both any use and any binge drinking, was associated with drinking prior to pregnancy, smoking during pregnancy, and white ethnicity. Higher income level was associated with any drinking during pregnancy. Neither drinking during pregnancy nor binge drinking during pregnancy was significantly associated with preterm delivery or low birth weight for gestational age in our sample.Pooling data across pregnancy cohort studies allowed us to create a large sample of Canadian women and investigate the risk factors for alcohol consumption during pregnancy. We suggest that future pregnancy and birth cohorts should always include questions related to the frequency and amount of alcohol consumed before and during pregnancy that are prospectively harmonized to support data reusability and collaborative research.© 2023.

"36721200","The effect of maternal BMI, smoking and alcohol on congenital heart diseases: a Mendelian randomisation study.","BMC Med","Congenital heart diseases (CHDs) remain a significant cause of infant morbidity and mortality. Epidemiological studies have explored maternal risk factors for offspring CHDs, but few have used genetic epidemiology methods to improve causal inference.Three birth cohorts, including 65,510 mother/offspring pairs (N = 562 CHD cases) were included. We used Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses to explore the effects of genetically predicted maternal body mass index (BMI), smoking and alcohol on offspring CHDs. We generated genetic risk scores (GRS) using summary data from large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and validated the strength and relevance of the genetic instrument for exposure levels during pregnancy. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) of CHD per 1 standard deviation (SD) higher GRS. Results for the three cohorts were combined using random-effects meta-analyses. We performed several sensitivity analyses including multivariable MR to check the robustness of our findings.The GRSs associated with the exposures during pregnancy in all three cohorts. The associations of the GRS for maternal BMI with offspring CHD (pooled OR (95% confidence interval) per 1SD higher GRS: 0.95 (0.88, 1.03)), lifetime smoking (pooled OR: 1.01 (0.93, 1.09)) and alcoholic drinks per week (pooled OR: 1.06 (0.98, 1.15)) were close to the null. Sensitivity analyses yielded similar results.Our results do not provide robust evidence of an effect of maternal BMI, smoking or alcohol on offspring CHDs. However, results were imprecise. Our findings need to be replicated, and highlight the need for more and larger studies with maternal and offspring genotype and offspring CHD data.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36703855","The association among SES, screen time, and outdoor play in children at different ages: The GECKO Drenthe study.","Front Public Health","This study examined the association among socioeconomic status (SES), screen time, and outdoor play in children at different ages in the GECKO Drenthe birth cohort study.Valid data were obtained from two surveys at ages 3-4 years and 10-11 years. Screen time (TV watching and computer use) and outdoor play were reported by parents. Childhood SES was derived by a synthetic ""Equivalized Household Income Indicator,"" an estimated disposable income. Quantile regression models (cross-sectional analysis) and linear regression models (change between 3-4 and 10-11 years) were used.In general, screen time increased strongly from a median of 51 min/day at 3-4 years (n= 888) to 122 min/day at 10-11 years (n= 1023), whereas time spent on outdoor play remained stable over age (77 min/day at 3-4 years and 81 min/day at 10-11 years). More time spent on outdoor play (50th quantile) was found in children with low SES families at 3-4 years, while at 10-11 years, more outdoor play was found in the high SES group. At 10-11 years, in the higher ranges of screen time, children from high SES had relatively lower screen time [50th quantile: -10.7 (-20.8; -0.6); 75th quantile: -13.6 (-24.4; -2.8)]. In the longitudinal analysis (n= 536), high SES was associated with an increasing time spent on outdoor play [11.7 (2.7; 20.8)].Socioeconomic disparities in children's outdoor play and screen behavior may be more obvious with increasing age. Low SES may facilitate both outdoor play (at 3-4 years) and screen time (at 10-11 years); however, children from high SES families develop slightly more favorable behavior patterns with age.Copyright © 2023 Lu, Wiersma and Corpeleijn."
"36701266","Gestational age at birth and body size from infancy through adolescence: An individual participant data meta-analysis on 253,810 singletons in 16 birth cohort studies.","PLoS Med","Preterm birth is the leading cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality and is associated with adverse developmental and long-term health outcomes, including several cardiometabolic risk factors and outcomes. However, evidence about the association of preterm birth with later body size derives mainly from studies using birth weight as a proxy of prematurity rather than an actual length of gestation. We investigated the association of gestational age (GA) at birth with body size from infancy through adolescence.We conducted a two-stage individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis using data from 253,810 mother-child dyads from 16 general population-based cohort studies in Europe (Denmark, Finland, France, Italy, Norway, Portugal, Spain, the Netherlands, United Kingdom), North America (Canada), and Australasia (Australia) to estimate the association of GA with body mass index (BMI) and overweight (including obesity) adjusted for the following maternal characteristics as potential confounders: education, height, prepregnancy BMI, ethnic background, parity, smoking during pregnancy, age at child's birth, gestational diabetes and hypertension, and preeclampsia. Pregnancy and birth cohort studies from the LifeCycle and the EUCAN-Connect projects were invited and were eligible for inclusion if they had information on GA and minimum one measurement of BMI between infancy and adolescence. Using a federated analytical tool (DataSHIELD), we fitted linear and logistic regression models in each cohort separately with a complete-case approach and combined the regression estimates and standard errors through random-effects study-level meta-analysis providing an overall effect estimate at early infancy (>0.0 to 0.5 years), late infancy (>0.5 to 2.0 years), early childhood (>2.0 to 5.0 years), mid-childhood (>5.0 to 9.0 years), late childhood (>9.0 to 14.0 years), and adolescence (>14.0 to 19.0 years). GA was positively associated with BMI in the first decade of life, with the greatest increase in mean BMI z-score during early infancy (0.02, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.00; 0.05, p < 0.05) per week of increase in GA, while in adolescence, preterm individuals reached similar levels of BMI (0.00, 95% CI: -0.01; 0.01, p 0.9) as term counterparts. The association between GA and overweight revealed a similar pattern of association with an increase in odds ratio (OR) of overweight from late infancy through mid-childhood (OR 1.01 to 1.02) per week increase in GA. By adolescence, however, GA was slightly negatively associated with the risk of overweight (OR 0.98 [95% CI: 0.97; 1.00], p 0.1) per week of increase in GA. Although based on only four cohorts (n = 32,089) that reached the age of adolescence, data suggest that individuals born very preterm may be at increased odds of overweight (OR 1.46 [95% CI: 1.03; 2.08], p < 0.05) compared with term counterparts. Findings were consistent across cohorts and sensitivity analyses despite considerable heterogeneity in cohort characteristics. However, residual confounding may be a limitation in this study, while findings may be less generalisable to settings in low- and middle-income countries.This study based on data from infancy through adolescence from 16 cohort studies found that GA may be important for body size in infancy, but the strength of association attenuates consistently with age. By adolescence, preterm individuals have on average a similar mean BMI to peers born at term.Copyright: © 2023 Vinther et al.

Several studies have shown that leukemic cells have a distinct immunological microenvironment, which is at least partially due to genetic alterations such as theTP53mutation and epigenetic dysregulation. HMAs possibly improve intrinsic anti-leukemic immunity and sensitivity to immune therapies such as PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors and anti-CD47 agents.

This study is to validate the effects of psychological factors on oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) among COFP patients in China. Pain catastrophizing, which is a subjective cognitive emotion used to manage the psychological aspects of pain among COFP patients, was examined in relation to COFP severity and OHRQoL. All 479 participants were recruited in Changsha, Hunan Province, China. Cronbach's alpha coefficients (0.868-0.960), composite reliability scores (0.924-0.969), and average variance extracted from each construct (0.555-0.753) all indicated a good model fit. Pearson's correlation analysis showed that age and education status have a positive correlation with COFP severity, pain catastrophizing, and anxiety. COFP severity was related to anxiety, depression, and COFP-OHRQoL. Pain catastrophizing was related to employment status. Anxiety and depression symptoms indirectly mediated the correlation between COFP severity and COFP-OHRQoL. As a second-stage moderator, pain catastrophizing moderated the mediating effects of anxiety symptoms and depression symptoms. Our findings suggest that anxiety, depression, and pain catastrophizing should be evaluated jointly to improve COFP-OHRQoL among COFP patients. This evidence will help therapists to comprehensively treat patients for the best treatment effect."
"36831044","Circulating Biomarkers for Prediction of Immunotherapy Response in NSCLC.","Biomedicines","Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) constitutes the majority of the lung cancer population and the prognosis is poor. In recent years, immunotherapy has become the standard of care for advanced NSCLC patients as numerous trials demonstrated that immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are more efficacious than conventional chemotherapy. However, only a minority of NSCLC patients benefit from this treatment. Therefore, there is an unmet need for biomarkers that could accurately predict response to immunotherapy. Liquid biopsy allows repeated sampling of blood-based biomarkers in a non-invasive manner for the dynamic monitoring of treatment response. In this review, we summarize the efforts and progress made in the identification of circulating biomarkers that predict immunotherapy benefit for NSCLC patients. We also discuss the challenges with future implementation of circulating biomarkers into clinical practice."

Although these approaches have far outperformed traditional therapies in various clinical settings, both remain plagued by mechanisms of innate and acquired resistance that limit therapeutic efficacy in many patients. With a focus on tumor-intrinsic resistance to immunotherapy, this review highlights our current understanding of the immunologic and oncogenic pathways whose genetic dysregulation in cancer cells enables immune escape. Emphasis is placed on genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic aberrations that influence the activity of these pathways in the context of immune resistance. Specifically, the role of pathways that govern interferon signaling, antigen processing and presentation, and immunologic cell death as determinants of tumor immune susceptibility are discussed. Likewise, mechanisms of tumor immune resistance mediated by dysregulated RAS-MAPK, WNT, PI3K-AKT-mTOR, and cell cycle pathways are described. Finally, this review highlights the ways in which recent insight into genetic dysregulation of these immunologic and oncogenic signaling pathways is informing the design of combination targeted therapy-immunotherapy regimens that aim to restore immune susceptibility of cancer cells by overcoming resistance mechanisms that often limit the success of monotherapies.© 2023.

In this regard, it should be noted that even in the advanced current situation of many techniques and methods accompanied with developments of technology, there are still existing challenges and needs focused on real samples and low concentrations of genomic materials. The approaches discussed/described adopt spectroscopical techniques and new optical setups. PCR bases are introduced to understand the role of non-covalent interactions by discussing about Nobel prizes related to genomic material detection. The review also discusses colorimetric methods, polymeric transducers, fluorescence detection methods, enhanced plasmonic techniques such as metal-enhanced fluorescence (MEF), semiconductors, and developments in metamaterials. In addition, nano-optics, challenges linked to signal transductions, and how the limitations reported in each technique could be overcome are considered in real samples. Accordingly, this study shows developments where optical active nanoplatforms generate signal detection and transduction with enhanced performances and, in many cases, enhanced signaling from single double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) interactions. Future perspectives on miniaturized instrumentation, chips, and devices aimed at detecting genomic material are analyzed. However, the main concept in this report derives from gained insights into nanochemistry and nano-optics. Such concepts could be incorporated into other higher-sized substrates and experimental and optical setups."

Exploring the regulation of both eQTLs and pQTLs simultaneously in a context- and cell-type dependent manner may help to unravel mechanistic basis for genetic regulation of pQTLs. Here, we performed meta-analysis ofCandida albicans-induced pQTLs from two population-based cohorts and intersected the results withCandida-induced cell-type specific expression association data (eQTL). This revealed systematic differences between the pQTLs and eQTL, where only 35% of the pQTLs significantly correlated with mRNA expressions at single cell level, indicating the limitation of eQTLs use as a proxy for pQTLs. By taking advantage of the tightly co-regulated pattern of the proteins, we also identified SNPs affecting protein network uponCandidastimulations. Colocalization of pQTLs and eQTLs signals implicated several genomic loci including MMP-1 and AMZ1. Analysis ofCandida-induced single cell gene expression data implicated specific cell types that exhibit significant expression QTLs upon stimulation. By highlighting the role of trans-regulatory networks in determining the abundance of secretory proteins, our study serve as a framework to gain insights into the mechanisms of genetic regulation of protein levels in a context-dependent manner.Copyright © 2023 Boahen, Oelen, Le, Netea, Franke, Wijst and Kumar."

Proteomics holds great promise in the discovery of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for HF. The aim of this study is to investigate the causal effects of genetically predicted plasma proteome on HF using the Mendelian randomization (MR) approach.Summary-level data for the plasma proteome (3,301 healthy individuals) and HF (47,309 cases; 930,014 controls) were extracted from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of European descent. MR associations were obtained using the inverse variance-weighted (IVW) method, sensitivity analyses, and multivariable MR analyses.Using single-nucleotide polymorphisms as instrumental variables, 1-SD increase in MET level was associated with an approximately 10% decreased risk of HF (odds ratio [OR]: 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.89 to 0.95;p = 1.42 × 10-6), whereas increases in the levels of CD209 (OR: 1.04; 95% CI: 1.02-1.06;p = 6.67 × 10-6) and USP25 (OR: 1.06; 95% CI: 1.03-1.08;p = 7.83 × 10-6) were associated with an increased risk of HF. The causal associations were robust in sensitivity analyses, and no evidence of pleiotropy was observed.The study findings suggest that the hepatocyte growth factor/c-MET signaling pathway, dendritic cells-mediated immune processes, and ubiquitin-proteasome system pathway are involved in the pathogenesis of HF.

"36812516","A proteomic survival predictor for COVID-19 patients in intensive care.","PLOS Digit Health","Global healthcare systems are challenged by the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a need to optimize allocation of treatment and resources in intensive care, as clinically established risk assessments such as SOFA and APACHE II scores show only limited performance for predicting the survival of severely ill COVID-19 patients. Additional tools are also needed to monitor treatment, including experimental therapies in clinical trials. Comprehensively capturing human physiology, we speculated that proteomics in combination with new data-driven analysis strategies could produce a new generation of prognostic discriminators. We studied two independent cohorts of patients with severe COVID-19 who required intensive care and invasive mechanical ventilation. SOFA score, Charlson comorbidity index, and APACHE II score showed limited performance in predicting the COVID-19 outcome. Instead, the quantification of 321 plasma protein groups at 349 timepoints in 50 critically ill patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation revealed 14 proteins that showed trajectories different between survivors and non-survivors. A predictor trained on proteomic measurements obtained at the first time point at maximum treatment level (i.e. WHO grade 7), which was weeks before the outcome, achieved accurate classification of survivors (AUROC 0.81). We tested the established predictor on an independent validation cohort (AUROC 1.0). The majority of proteins with high relevance in the prediction model belong to the coagulation system and complement cascade. Our study demonstrates that plasma proteomics can give rise to prognostic predictors substantially outperforming current prognostic markers in intensive care.Copyright: © 2022 Demichev et al.

In this study, we investigated cellular senescence phenotypes of pre-eclampsia and IUGR pregnancies by simultaneously measuring several biomarkers of senescence. Maternal plasma and placental samples were collected at term gestation from nulliparous women undergoing pre-labour elective caesarean section with pre-eclampsia without intrauterine growth restriction (PE;n= 5), pre-eclampsia associated with intrauterine growth restriction (n = 8), intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR < 10th centile;n= 6), and age-matched controls (n= 20). Placental absolute telomere length and senescence gene analysis was performed by RTqPCR. The expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (p21 and p16) was determined by Western blot. Senescence-associated secretory phenotypes (SASPs) were evaluated in maternal plasma by multiplex ELISA assay. Placental expression of senescence-associated genes showed significant increases in CHEK1, PCNA, PTEN, CDKN2A, and CCNB-1 (p< 0.05) in pre-eclampsia, while TBX-2, PCNA, ATM, and CCNB-1 expression were evident (p< 0.05) and were significantly decreased in IUGR compared with controls. Placental p16 protein expression was significantly decreased in pre-eclampsia only compared with controls (p= 0.028). IL-6 was significantly increased in pre-eclampsia (0.54 pg/mL ± 0.271 vs. 0.3 pg/mL ± 0.102;p= 0.017) while IFN-γ was significantly increased in IUGR (4.6 pg/mL ± 2.2 vs. 2.17 pg/mL ± 0.8;p= 0.002) compared with controls. These results provide evidence of premature senescence in IUGR pregnancies, and while cell cycle checkpoint regulators are activated in pre-eclampsia, the cellular phenotype is one of cell repair and subsequent proliferation rather than progression to senescence. The heterogeneity of these cellular phenotypes highlights the complexity of characterising cellular senescence and may equally be indicative of the differing pathophysiological insults unique to each obstetric complication."

It is unknown whether pathophysiology in vivo can be attenuated by lowering mHTT in either cell type throughout the brain, and the relative contributions of neurons and astrocytes to HD remain undefined. We use zinc finger protein (ZFP) transcriptional repressors to cell-selectively lower mHTT in vivo. Astrocytes display loss of essential functions such as cholesterol metabolism that are partly driven by greater neuronal dysfunctions, which encompass neuromodulation, synaptic, and intracellular signaling pathways. Using transcriptomics, proteomics, electrophysiology, and behavior, we dissect neuronal and astrocytic contributions to HD pathophysiology. Remarkably, brain-wide delivery of neuronal ZFPs results in strong mHTT lowering, rescue of HD-associated behavioral and molecular phenotypes, and significant extension of lifespan, findings that support translational development.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

Recent studies have demonstrated that activation of the immune system plays an important role in the occurrence and maintenance of HT. Thus, this research aimed to determine the immune-related biomarkers in HT. In this study, RNA sequencing data of the gene expression profiling datasets (GSE74144) were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differentially expressed genes between HT and normal samples were identified using the software limma. The immune-related genes associated with HT were screened. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analyses were performed using the program ""clusterProfiler"" of the R package. The protein-protein interaction network of these differentially expressed immune-related genes (DEIRGs) was constructed based on the information from the STRING database. Finally, the TF-hub and miRNA-hub gene regulatory networks were predicted and constructed using the miRNet software. Fifty-nine DEIRGs were observed in HT. The Gene Ontology analysis indicated that DEIRGs were mainly enriched in the positive regulation of cytosolic calcium ions, peptide hormones, protein kinase B signaling, and lymphocyte differentiation. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis indicated that these DEIRGs were significantly involved in the intestinal immune network for IgA production, autoimmune thyroid disease, JAK-STAT signaling pathway, hepatocellular carcinoma, and Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus infection, among others. From the protein-protein interaction network, 5 hub genes (insulin-like growth factor 2, cytokine-inducible Src homology 2-containing protein, suppressor of cytokine signaling 1, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A, and epidermal growth factor receptor) were identified. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed in GSE74144, and all genes with an area under the curve of > 0.7 were identified as the diagnostic genes.

The aging-related decline of the immune system, termed immunosenescence, can lead to disease development, including cancer. The perturbation of immunosenescence genes may characterize the associations between cancer and aging. However, the systematical characterization of immunosenescence genes in pan-cancer remains largely unexplored. In this study, we comprehensively investigated the expression of immunosenescence genes and their roles in 26 types of cancer. We developed an integrated computational pipeline to identify and characterize immunosenescence genes in cancer based on the expression profiles of immune genes and clinical information of patients. We identified 2218 immunosenescence genes that were significantly dysregulated in a wide variety of cancers. These immunosenescence genes were divided into six categories based on their relationships with aging. Besides, we assessed the importance of immunosenescence genes in clinical prognosis and identified 1327 genes serving as prognostic markers in cancers. BTN3A1, BTN3A2, CTSD, CYTIP, HIF1AN, and RASGRP1 were associated with ICB immunotherapy response and served as prognostic factors after ICB immunotherapy in melanoma. Collectively, our results furthered the understanding of the relationship between immunosenescence and cancer and provided insights into immunotherapy for patients.© 2023.

"36699345","Towards future directions in data-integrative supervised prediction of human aging-related genes.","Bioinform Adv","Identification of human genes involved in the aging process is critical due to the incidence of many diseases with age. A state-of-the-art approach for this purpose infers a weighted dynamic aging-specific subnetwork by mapping gene expression (GE) levels at different ages onto the protein-protein interaction network (PPIN). Then, it analyzes this subnetwork in a supervised manner by training a predictive model to learn how network topologies of known aging- versus non-aging-related genes change across ages. Finally, it uses the trained model to predict novel aging-related gene candidates. However, the best current subnetwork resulting from this approach still yields suboptimal prediction accuracy. This could be because it was inferred using outdated GE and PPIN data. Here, we evaluate whether analyzing a weighted dynamic aging-specific subnetwork inferred from newer GE and PPIN data improves prediction accuracy upon analyzing the best current subnetwork inferred from outdated data.Unexpectedly, we find that not to be the case. To understand this, we perform aging-related pathway and Gene Ontology term enrichment analyses. We find that the suboptimal prediction accuracy, regardless of which GE or PPIN data is used, may be caused by the current knowledge about which genes are aging-related being incomplete, or by the current methods for inferring or analyzing an aging-specific subnetwork being unable to capture all of the aging-related knowledge. These findings can potentially guide future directions towards improving supervised prediction of aging-related genes via -omics data integration.All data and code are available at zenodo, DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.6995045.Supplementary data are available atBioinformatics Advancesonline.© The Author(s) 2022.

It is necessary to search for improvement in diagnosis and treatment methods to improve the prognosis. Protein kinase, membrane associated tyrosine/threonine 1 (PKMYT1), a member of the Wee family of protein kinases, has been studied in some tumors except BC. This study has explored that PKMYT1 functional role by bioinformatics methods combined with local clinical samples and experiments. Comprehensive analysis showed that PKMYT1 expression was higher in BC tissues, especially in advanced patients than that in normal breast tissues. The expression of PKMYT1 was an independent determinant for BC patients' prognosis when combined with the clinical features. In addition, based on multi-omics analysis, we found that the PKMYT1 expression was closely relevant to several oncogenic or tumor suppressor gene variants. The analysis of single-cell sequencing indicated that PKMYT1 expression was upregulated in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), consistent with the results of bulk RNA-sequencing. High PKMYT1 expression was correlated with a poor prognosis. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that PKMYT1 expression was associated with cell cycle-related, DNA replication-related, and cancer-related pathways. Further research revealed that PKMYT1 expression was linked to immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, loss-of-function experimentsin vitrowere performed to investigate the role of PKMYT1. TNBC cell lines' proliferation, migration, and invasion were inhibited when PKMYT1 expression was knock-down. Besides, the down-regulation of PKMYT1 induced apoptosisin vitro. As a result, PKMYT1 might be a biomarker for prognosis and a therapeutic target for TNBC.Copyright © 2023 Li, Wang, Zhang, Dong, Cai, Huang and Dong."

Literature was compiled using search engines (PubMed, PubMed central, Medline, and Google) and data from the Canadian Organ Replacement Register.We reviewed the impact, prevalence, economic burden, causes of kidney disease, and priority research areas in Canada. After reviewing the priority areas for kidney research, potential avenues for future research that can integrate precision medicine initiatives for patient-oriented research were outlined.Chronic kidney disease (CKD) remains among the top causes of morbidity and mortality in the world and exerts a large financial strain on the health care system.

The identification of genetic factors for various forms of kidney disease in the adult and pediatric populations provides mechanistic insight into disease pathogenesis. Allocation of resources and funding toward existing high-yield personalized research initiatives have the potential to significantly affect patient-oriented research outcomes but will be difficult due to a constant decline of funding for kidney research.This is an overview primarily focused on Canadian-specific literature rather than a comprehensive systematic review of the literature.

"36787250","Molecular pathways that drive diabetic kidney disease.","J Clin Invest","Kidney disease is a major driver of mortality among patients with diabetes and diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is responsible for close to half of all chronic kidney disease cases. DKD usually develops in a genetically susceptible individual as a result of poor metabolic (glycemic) control. Molecular and genetic studies indicate the key role of podocytes and endothelial cells in driving albuminuria and early kidney disease in diabetes. Proximal tubule changes show a strong association with the glomerular filtration rate. Hyperglycemia represents a key cellular stress in the kidney by altering cellular metabolism in endothelial cells and podocytes and by imposing an excess workload requiring energy and oxygen for proximal tubule cells. Changes in metabolism induce early adaptive cellular hypertrophy and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Later, mitochondrial defects contribute to increased oxidative stress and activation of inflammatory pathways, causing progressive kidney function decline and fibrosis. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system or the sodium-glucose cotransporter is associated with cellular protection and slowing kidney function decline. Newly identified molecular pathways could provide the basis for the development of much-needed novel therapeutics."
"36747796","Incorporating interactions into structured life course modelling approaches: A simulation study and applied example of the role of access to green space and socioeconomic position on cardiometabolic health.","medRxiv","Structured life course modelling approaches (SLCMA) have been developed to understand how exposures across the lifespan relate to later health, but have primarily been restricted to single exposures. As multiple exposures can jointly impact health, here we: i) demonstrate how to extend SLCMA to include exposure interactions; ii) conduct a simulation study investigating the performance of these methods; and iii) apply these methods to explore associations of access to green space, and its interaction with socioeconomic position, with child cardiometabolic health.We used three methods, all based on lasso regression, to select the most plausible life course model: visual inspection, information criteria and cross-validation. The simulation study assessed the ability of these approaches to detect the correct interaction term, while varying parameters which may impact power (e.g., interaction magnitude, sample size, exposure collinearity). Methods were then applied to data from a UK birth cohort.There were trade-offs between false negatives and false positives in detecting the true interaction term for different model selection methods. Larger sample size, lower exposure collinearity, centering exposures, continuous outcomes and a larger interaction effect all increased power. In our applied example we found little-to-no association between access to green space, or its interaction with socioeconomic position, and child cardiometabolic outcomes.Incorporating interactions between multiple exposures is an important extension to SLCMA. The choice of method depends on the researchers' assessment of the risks of under-vs over-fitting. These results also provide guidance for improving power to detect interactions using these methods.In life course epidemiology, it is important to consider how multiple exposures over the lifespan may jointly influence health.We demonstrate how to extend current structured life course modelling approaches to include interactions between multiple different exposures.A simulation study comparing different methods to detect a true interaction effect found a trade-off between false positives and false negatives, suggesting that the optimal choice of method may depend on the researchers' assessment of this trade-off (e.g., exploratory studies may prefer a greater risk of false positives, while confirmatory studies may prefer to minimise the risk of false positives).We identified key factors that improve power to detect a true interaction effect, namely larger sample sizes, centering exposures, lower exposure collinearity, continuous outcomes and larger interaction effect sizes.We applied these methods in a UK birth cohort (ALSPAC; Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children), finding little-to-no evidence of an association between access to green space and its interaction with socioeconomic position on child BMI, obesity or blood pressure."

We develop a method that does not require specialized microfluidic devices, expertise or hardware. Our approach is based on particle-templated emulsification, which allows single-cell encapsulation and barcoding of cDNA in uniform droplet emulsions with only a vortexer. Particle-templated instant partition sequencing (PIP-seq) accommodates a wide range of emulsification formats, including microwell plates and large-volume conical tubes, enabling thousands of samples or millions of cells to be processed in minutes. We demonstrate that PIP-seq produces high-purity transcriptomes in mouse-human mixing studies, is compatible with multiomics measurements and can accurately characterize cell types in human breast tissue compared to a commercial microfluidic platform. Single-cell transcriptional profiling of mixed phenotype acute leukemia using PIP-seq reveals the emergence of heterogeneity within chemotherapy-resistant cell subsets that were hidden by standard immunophenotyping.

"36778447","Benchmarking algorithms for joint integration of unpaired and paired single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data.","bioRxiv","Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) measures gene expression in single cells, while single-nucleus ATAC-sequencing (snATAC-seq) enables the quantification of chromatin accessibility in single nuclei. These two data types provide complementary information for deciphering cell types/states. However, when analyzed individually, scRNA-seq and snATAC-seq data often produce conflicting results regarding cell type/state assignment. In addition, there is a loss of power as the two modalities reflect the same underlying cell types/states. Recently, it has become possible to measure both gene expression and chromatin accessibility from the same nucleus. Such paired data make it possible to directly model the relationships between the two modalities. However, given the availability of the vast amount of single-modality data, it is desirable to integrate the paired and unpaired single-modality data to gain a comprehensive view of the cellular complexity. Here, we benchmarked the performance of seven existing single-cell multi-omic data integration methods. Specifically, we evaluated whether these methods are able to uncover peak-gene associations from single-modality data, and to what extent the multiome data can provide additional guidance for the analysis of the existing single-modality data. Our results indicate that multiome data are helpful for annotating single-modality data, but the number of cells in the multiome data is critical to ensure a good cell type annotation. Additionally, when generating a multiome dataset, the number of cells is more important than sequencing depth for cell type annotation. Lastly, Seurat v4 is the best at integrating scRNA-seq, snATAC-seq, and multiome data even in the presence of complex batch effects."

Single-cell techniques provide excellent tools for studying alterations at the cellular level of disorders. However, the application of these techniques in research on musculoskeletal disorders is still limited.

Cell isolation, experimental methods, and feasible experimental designs for single-cell studies of musculoskeletal system diseases have been reviewed based on tissue characteristics. Then, the paper summarizes the latest findings of single-cell studies in musculoskeletal disorders from three aspects: bone and ossification, joint, and muscle and tendon disorders. Recent discoveries about the cell populations involved in these diseases are highlighted. Furthermore, the therapeutic responses of musculoskeletal disorders, especially single-cell changes after the treatments of implants, stem cell therapies, and drugs are described.

However, these regions often contain many individual variants, while only a subset of them are likely to causally contribute to a trait. Statistical fine-mapping techniques can identify putative causal variants, but their resolution is often limited, especially in regions with multiple variants in high linkage disequilibrium. In these cases, alternative computational methods to estimate the impact of individual variants can aid in variant prioritization.Here, we develop a deep learning pipeline to predict cell-type-specific enhancer activity directly from genomic sequences and quantify the impact of individual genetic variants in these regions. We show that the variants highlighted by our deep learning models are targeted by purifying selection in the human population, likely indicating a functional role. We integrate our deep learning predictions with statistical fine-mapping results for 8 brain-related traits, identifying 63 distinct candidate causal variants predicted to contribute to these traits by modulating enhancer activity, representing 6% of all genome-wide association study signals analyzed. Overall, our study provides a valuable computational method that can prioritize individual variants based on their estimated regulatory impact, but also highlights the limitations of existing methods for variant prioritization and fine-mapping.The data underlying this article, nucleotide-level importance scores, and code for running the deep learning pipeline are available at https://github.com/Pandaman-Ryan/AgentBind-brain.mgymrek@ucsd.edu.Supplementary data are available atBioinformatics Advancesonline.© The Author(s) 2023.

"36759911","New insights on partial trisomy 3q syndrome: de novo 3q27.1-q29 duplication in a newborn with pre and postnatal overgrowth and assisted reproductive conception.","Ital J Pediatr","Duplications of the long arm of chromosome 3 are rare, and associated to a well-defined contiguous gene syndrome known as partial trisomy 3q syndrome. It has been first described in 1966 by Falek et al., and since then around 100 patients have been reported. Clinical manifestations include characteristic facial dysmorphic features, microcephaly, hirsutism, congenital heart disease, genitourinary anomalies, hand and feet abnormalities, growth disturbances and intellectual disability. Most of cases are due to unbalanced translocations, inherited from a parent carrying a balanced aberration (reciprocal translocation or inversion), and rarely the genomic anomaly arises de novo. Very few studies report on the prenatal identification of such rearrangements.Hereby, we report on a newborn with a rare pure duplication of the long arm of chromosome 3. Noninvasive prenatal test (cell free fetal DNA analysis on maternal blood), performed for advanced parental age and use of assisted reproductive technique, evidenced a partial 3q trisomy. Then, invasive cytogenetic (standard and molecular) investigations, carried out through amniocentesis, confirmed and defined a 3q27.1-q29 duplication spanning 10.9 Mb, and including about 80 genes. Our patient showed clinical findings (typical facial dysmorphic features, esotropia, short neck, atrial septal defect, hepatomegaly, mild motor delay) compatible with partial trisomy 3q syndrome diagnosis, in addition to pre- and postnatal overgrowth.Advanced parental age increases the probability of chromosomal and/or genomic anomalies, while ART that of epigenomic defects. Both conditions, thus, deserve more careful prenatal monitoring and screening/diagnostic investigations. Among the latter, cell free fetal DNA testing can detect large segmental aneuploidies, along with chromosomal abnormalities. It identified in our patient a wide 3q rearrangement, then confirmed and defined through invasive molecular cytogenetic analysis. Neonatologists and pediatricians must be aware of the potential risks associated to duplication syndromes. Therefore, they should offer to affected subjects an adequate management and early and careful follow-up. These may be able to guarantee to patients satisfactory growth and development profiles, prevent and/or limit neurodevelopmental disorders, and timely recognition of complications.© 2023.

"36713371","Walk on the wild side: SIV infection in African non-human primate hosts-from the field to the laboratory.","Front Immunol","HIV emerged following cross-species transmissions of simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) that naturally infect non-human primates (NHPs) from Africa. While HIV replication and CD4+T-cell depletion lead to increased gut permeability, microbial translocation, chronic immune activation, and systemic inflammation, the natural hosts of SIVs generally avoid these deleterious consequences when infected with their species-specific SIVs and do not progress to AIDS despite persistent lifelong high viremia due to long-term coevolution with their SIV pathogens. The benign course of natural SIV infection in the natural hosts is in stark contrast to the experimental SIV infection of Asian macaques, which progresses to simian AIDS. The mechanisms of non-pathogenic SIV infections are studied mainly in African green monkeys, sooty mangabeys, and mandrills, while progressing SIV infection is experimentally modeled in macaques: rhesus macaques, pigtailed macaques, and cynomolgus macaques. Here, we focus on the distinctive features of SIV infection in natural hosts, particularly (1): the superior healing properties of the intestinal mucosa, which enable them to maintain the integrity of the gut barrier and prevent microbial translocation, thus avoiding excessive/pathologic immune activation and inflammation usually perpetrated by the leaking of the microbial products into the circulation; (2) the gut microbiome, the disruption of which is an important factor in some inflammatory diseases, yet not completely understood in the course of lentiviral infection; (3) cell population shifts resulting in target cell restriction (downregulation of CD4 or CCR5 surface molecules that bind to SIV), control of viral replication in the lymph nodes (expansion of natural killer cells), and anti-inflammatory effects in the gut (NKG2a/c+CD8+T cells); and (4) the genes and biological pathways that can shape genetic adaptations to viral pathogens and are associated with the non-pathogenic outcome of the natural SIV infection. Deciphering the protective mechanisms against SIV disease progression to immunodeficiency, which have been established through long-term coevolution between the natural hosts and their species-specific SIVs, may prompt the development of novel therapeutic interventions, such as drugs that can control gut inflammation, enhance gut healing capacities, or modulate the gut microbiome. These developments can go beyond HIV infection and open up large avenues for correcting gut damage, which is common in many diseases.Copyright © 2023 Jasinska, Apetrei and Pandrea."
"36771351","Dietary Responses of Dementia-Related Genes Encoding Metabolic Enzymes.","Nutrients","The age-related loss of the cognitive function is a growing concern for global populations. Many factors that determine cognitive resilience or dementia also have metabolic functions. However, this duality is not universally appreciated when the action of that factor occurs in tissues external to the brain. Thus, we examined a set of genes involved in dementia, i.e., those related to vascular dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and the human metabolism for activity in 12 metabolically active tissues. Mining the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data showed that most of these metabolism-dementia (MD) genes (62 of 93, 67%) exhibit a higher median expression in any of the metabolically active tissues than in the brain. After identifying that several MD genes served as blood-based biomarkers of longevity in other studies, we examined the impact of the intake of food, nutrients, and other dietary factors on the expression of MD genes in whole blood in the Framingham Offspring Study (n= 2134). We observed positive correlations between flavonoids andHMOX1, taurine andUQCRC1, broccoli andSLC10A2, and myricetin andSLC9A8(p< 2.09 × 10-4). In contrast, dairy protein, palmitic acid, and pie were negatively correlated, respectively, with the expression ofIGF1R,CSF1R, andSLC9A8, among others (p< 2.92 × 10-4). The results of this investigation underscore the potential contributions of metabolic enzyme activity in non-brain tissues to the risk of dementia. Specific epidemiological or intervention studies could be designed using specific foods and nutrients or even dietary patterns focused on these foods and nutrients that influence the expression of some MD genes to verify the findings presented here."

Due to the exceedingly uncommon occurrence of these tumors, there is controversy regarding the optimal evidence-based management for these patients. We therefore report on a 70-year-old male patient admitted with 3 months of episodic confusion with concurrent hypoglycemia. The patient was found to have inappropriately elevated endogenous insulin levels during these episodes, and somatostatin-receptor subtype 2 selective imaging revealed a pancreatic mass metastatic to local lymph nodes, spleen, and the liver. Fine needle aspiration of pancreatic and liver lesions confirmed the diagnosis of a low grade pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. Molecular analysis of tumor tissue revealed a novel mutational profile consistent with pNET. The patient was initiated on octreotide therapy. However, treatment with octreotide alone demonstrated limited efficacy in controlling the patient's symptoms, prompting consideration of other therapies."
"36830839","An Insight on Functioning Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Neoplasms.","Biomedicines","Pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (PanNENs) are rare neoplasms arising from islets of the Langerhans in the pancreas. They can be divided into two groups, based on peptide hormone secretion, functioning and nonfunctioning PanNENs. The first group is characterized by different secreted peptides causing specific syndromes and is further classified into subgroups: insulinoma, gastrinoma, glucagonoma, somatostatinoma, VIPoma and tumors producing serotonin and adrenocorticotrophic hormone. Conversely, the second group does not release peptides and is usually associated with a worse prognosis. Today, although the efforts to improve the therapeutic approaches, surgery remains the only curative treatment for patients with PanNENs. The development of high-throughput techniques has increased the molecular knowledge of PanNENs, thereby allowing us to understand better the molecular biology and potential therapeutic vulnerabilities of PanNENs. Although enormous advancements in therapeutic and molecular aspects of PanNENs have been achieved, there is poor knowledge about each subgroup of functioning PanNENs.Therefore, we believe that combining high-throughput platforms with new diagnostic tools will allow for the efficient characterization of the main differences among the subgroups of functioning PanNENs. In this narrative review, we summarize the current landscape regarding diagnosis, molecular profiling and treatment, and we discuss the future perspectives of functioning PanNENs."
"36765893","Transcriptomic Deconvolution of Neuroendocrine Neoplasms Predicts Clinically Relevant Characteristics.","Cancers (Basel)","Pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (panNENs) are a rare yet diverse type of neoplasia whose precise clinical-pathological classification is frequently challenging. Since incorrect classifications can affect treatment decisions, additional tools which support the diagnosis, such as machine learning (ML) techniques, are critically needed but generally unavailable due to the scarcity of suitable ML training data for rare panNENs. Here, we demonstrate that a multi-step ML framework predicts clinically relevant panNEN characteristics while being exclusively trained on widely available data of a healthy origin. The approach classifies panNENs by deconvolving their transcriptomes into cell type proportions based on shared gene expression profiles with healthy pancreatic cell types. The deconvolution results were found to provide a prognostic value with respect to the prediction of the overall patient survival time, neoplastic grading, and carcinoma versus tumor subclassification. The performance with which a proliferation rate agnostic deconvolution ML model could predict the clinical characteristics was found to be comparable to that of a comparative baseline model trained on the proliferation rate-informedMKI67levels. The approach is novel in that it complements established proliferation rate-oriented classification schemes whose results can be reproduced and further refined by differentiating between identically graded subgroups. By including non-endocrine cell types, the deconvolution approach furthermore provides an in silico quantification of panNEN dedifferentiation, optimizing it for challenging clinical classification tasks in more aggressive panNEN subtypes."

High-resolution methods to detect 5hmC require high sequencing depth and are therefore expensive. Many studies have used enrichment-based methods to detect 5hmC; however, conventional enrichment-based methods have limited resolution. To overcome these limitations, we developed EBS-seq, a cost-efficient method for 5hmC detection with single-base resolution that combines the advantages of high-resolution methods and enrichment-based methods.EBS-seq uses selective labeling of 5hmC, deamination of cytosine and 5-methylcytosine, pull-down of labeled 5hmC, and C-to-T conversion during DNA amplification. Using this method, we profiled 5hmC in HEK293T cells and two colorectal cancer samples. Compared with conventional enrichment-based 5hmC detection, EBS-seq improved 5hmC signals by localizing them at single-base resolution. Furthermore, EBS-seq was able to determine 5hmC levels in CpG-dense regions where distortion of signals can occur, such as CpG islands and CpG shores. Comparing EBS-seq and conventional high-resolution 5hmC detection by ACE-seq, we showed that EBS-seq is more effective at finding 5hmC sites. Using EBS-seq, we found strong associations between gene expression and gene-body 5hmC content in both HEK293T cells and colorectal cancer samples.EBS-seq is a reliable and cost-efficient method for 5hmC detection because it simultaneously enriches 5hmC-containing DNA fragments and localizes 5hmC signals at single-base resolution. This method is a promising choice for 5hmC detection in challenging clinical samples with low 5hmC levels, such as cancer tissues.© 2023. The Author(s)."

However, much less is known about seasonal diversity distributions and assembly mechanisms of abundant and rare bacteria in drinking water. The combination of environmental variables and high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing was conducted to examine the composition, assembly, co-occurrence patterns of abundant and rare bacteria from five drinking water sites across four seasons in one year in China. The results indicated that abundant taxa were mainly composed of Rhizobiales_UG1, Sphingomonadales_UG1, and Comamonadaceae, while rare taxa were Sphingomonadales_UG1, Rhizobiales_UG2, and Rhizobiales_UG1. The richness of rare bacteria was greater than that of abundant ones, and the richness had no differences among seasons. The beta diversity was significantly discrepant in abundant and rare communities and among seasons. Deterministic mechanism accounted for a larger contribution to abundant taxa than rare taxa. Furthermore, water temperature had higher effects on abundant microbiome than rare ones. Co-occurrence network analysis indicated that abundant taxa that occupied frequently in central positions had stronger effect on co-occurrence network. In our study, these results collectively suggested that rare bacteria respond to environmental variables with an analogical pattern to abundant counterparts (similar community assembly), but their ecological diversities, driving forces, and co-occurrence patterns were not equivalent in drinking water.© 2023.

While such biomarkers have been mainly identified based on the assumption of a linear relationship between phenotypic parameters, including molecular markers, and chronological age, numerous nonlinear changes between markers and aging have been identified. However, the overall landscape of the patterns in nonlinear changes that exist in aging is unknown.We propose a novel computational method, Data-driven Identification and Classification of Nonlinear Aging Patterns (DICNAP), that is based on functional data analysis to identify biomarkers for aging and potential patterns of change during aging in a data-driven manner. We applied the proposed method to large-scale, public DNA methylation data to explore the potential patterns of age-related changes in methylation intensity. The results showed that not only linear, but also nonlinear changes in DNA methylation patterns exist. A monotonous demethylation pattern during aging, with its rate decreasing at around age 60, was identified as the candidate stable nonlinear pattern. We also analyzed the age-related changes in methylation variability. The results showed that the variability of methylation intensity tends to increase with age at age-associated sites. The representative variability pattern is a monotonically increasing pattern that accelerates after middle age.DICNAP was able to identify the potential patterns of the changes in the landscape of DNA methylation during aging. It contributes to an improvement in our theoretical understanding of the aging process.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Recently developed Pore-C can capture multiway chromatin contacts that reflect regional topologies of single chromosomes. By carrying out high-throughput Pore-C, we reveal extensive but regionally restricted clusters of single-allele topologies that aggregate into canonical 3D genome structures in two human cell types. We show that fragments in multi-contact reads generally coexist in the same TAD. In contrast, a concurrent significant proportion of multi-contact reads span multiple compartments of the same chromatin type over megabase distances. Synergistic chromatin looping between multiple sites in multi-contact reads is rare compared to pairwise interactions. Interestingly, the single-allele topology clusters are cell type-specific even inside highly conserved TADs in different types of cells. In summary, HiPore-C enables global characterization of single-allele topologies at an unprecedented depth to reveal elusive genome folding principles.© 2023. The Author(s)."

However, the regenerative mechanism behind this has remained unknown. This long process is reminiscent of the normal development of the visual system from immature neural cells to mature neurons. Here, we focused on the expression of three Yamanaka factors (Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4: OSK), which are well-known inducers of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells in the zebrafish retina after ONI. mRNA expression of OSK was rapidly induced in the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) 1-3 h after ONI. Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) mRNA was most rapidly induced in the RGCs at 0.5 h. The activation of OSK mRNA was completely suppressed by the intraocular injection of HSF1 morpholino prior to ONI. Furthermore, the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed the enrichment of OSK genomic DNA bound to HSF1. The present study clearly showed that the rapid activation of Yamanaka factors in the zebrafish retina was regulated by HSF1, and this sequential activation of HSF1 and OSK might provide a key to unlocking the regenerative mechanism of injured RGCs in fish."

Rejuvenation aims to influence the natural evolution of such aging clocks and to enhance regenerative capacity, thus overcoming the limitations of common anti-aging interventions. Current rejuvenation processes are based on heterochronic parabiosis, cell damage dilution through asymmetrical cell division, the excretion of extracellular vesicles, the modulation of genetic instability involving G-quadruplexes and DNA methylation, and cell reprogramming using Yamanaka factors and the actions of antioxidant species. In this context, we reviewed the most recent contributions that report on small molecules acting as senotherapeutics; these molecules act by promoting one or more of the abovementioned processes. Candidate drugs and natural compounds that are being studied as potential rejuvenation therapies act by interfering with CDGSH iron-sulfur domain 2 (CISD2) expression, G-quadruplex structures, DNA methylation, and mitochondrial decay. Moreover, direct and indirect antioxidants have been reported to counteract or revert aging through a combination of mixed mechanisms."
"36768896","Aging Effects on Optic Nerve Neurodegeneration.","Int J Mol Sci","Common risk factors for many ocular pathologies involve non-pathologic, age-related damage to the optic nerve. Understanding the mechanisms of age-related changes can facilitate targeted treatments for ocular pathologies that arise at any point in life. In this review, we examine these age-related, neurodegenerative changes in the optic nerve, contextualize these changes from the anatomic to the molecular level, and appreciate their relationship with ocular pathophysiology. From simple structural and mechanical changes at the optic nerve head (ONH), to epigenetic and biochemical alterations of tissue and the environment, multiple age-dependent mechanisms drive extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss, and lowered regenerative ability of respective axons. In conjunction, aging decreases the ability of myelin to preserve maximal conductivity, even with ""successfully"" regenerated axons. Glial cells, however, regeneratively overcompensate and result in a microenvironment that promotes RGC axonal death. Better elucidating optic nerve neurodegeneration remains of interest, specifically investigating human ECM, RGCs, axons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes; clarifying the exact processes of aged ocular connective tissue alterations and their ultrastructural impacts; and developing novel technologies and pharmacotherapies that target known genetic, biochemical, matrisome, and neuroinflammatory markers. Management models should account for age-related changes when addressing glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and other blinding diseases."
"36743471","Reprogramming of ovarian aging epigenome by resveratrol.","PNAS Nexus","Resveratrol is an antiaging, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory natural polyphenolic compound. Growing evidence indicates that resveratrol has potential therapeutic effects for improving aging ovarian function. However, the mechanisms underlying prolonged reproductive longevity remain elusive. We found that resveratrol ameliorates ovarian aging transcriptome, some of which are associated with specific changes in methylome. In addition to known aging transcriptome of oocytes and granulosa cells such as decline in oxidoreductase activity, metabolism and mitochondria function, and elevated DNA damage and apoptosis, actin cytoskeleton are notably downregulated with age, and these defects are mostly rescued by resveratrol. Moreover, the aging-associated hypermethylation of actin cytoskeleton is decreased by resveratrol. In contrast, deletion ofTet2, involved in DNA demethylation, abrogates resveratrol-reprogrammed ovarian aging transcriptome. Consistently,Tet2deficiency results in additional altered pathways as shown by increased mTOR and Wnt signaling, as well as reduced DNA repair and actin cytoskeleton with mouse age. Moreover, genes associated with oxidoreductase activity and oxidation-reduction process were hypermethylated inTet2-deficient oocytes from middle-age mice treated with resveratrol, indicating that loss ofTet2abolishes the antioxidant effect of resveratrol. Taking together, our finding provides a comprehensive landscape of transcriptome and epigenetic changes associated with ovarian aging that can be reprogrammed by resveratrol administration, and suggests that aberrantly increased DNA methylation byTet2deficiency promotes additional aging epigenome that cannot be effectively restored to younger state by resveratrol.The Author(s) 2023.

"36717618","Purified regenerating retinal neurons reveal regulatory role of DNA methylation-mediated Na+/K+-ATPase in murine axon regeneration.","Commun Biol","While embryonic mammalian central nervous system (CNS) axons readily grow and differentiate, only a minority of fully differentiated mature CNS neurons are able to regenerate injured axons, leading to stunted functional recovery after injury and disease. To delineate DNA methylation changes specifically associated with axon regeneration, we used a Fluorescent-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS)-based methodology in a rat optic nerve transection model to segregate the injured retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) into regenerating and non-regenerating cell populations. Whole-genome DNA methylation profiling of these purified neurons revealed genes and pathways linked to mammalian RGC regeneration. Moreover, whole-methylome sequencing of purified uninjured adult and embryonic RGCs identified embryonic molecular profiles reactivated after injury in mature neurons, and others that correlate specifically with embryonic or adult axon growth, but not both. The results highlight the contribution to both embryonic growth and adult axon regeneration of subunits encoding the Na+/K+-ATPase. In turn, both biochemical and genetic inhibition of the Na+/K+-ATPase pump significantly reduced RGC axon regeneration. These data provide critical molecular insights into mammalian CNS axon regeneration, pinpoint the Na+/K+-ATPase as a key regulator of regeneration of injured mature CNS axons, and suggest that successful regeneration requires, in part, reactivation of embryonic signals.© 2023.

"36711649","Damage-induced senescent immune cells regulate regeneration of the zebrafish retina.","bioRxiv","Zebrafish spontaneously regenerate their retina in response to damage through the action of Müller glia. Even though Müller glia (MG) are conserved in higher vertebrates, the capacity to regenerate retinal damage is lost. Recent work has focused on the regulation of inflammation during tissue regeneration with precise temporal roles for macrophages and microglia. Senescent cells that have withdrawn from the cell cycle have mostly been implicated in aging, but are still metabolically active, releasing pro-inflammatory signaling molecules as part of the Senescence Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP). Here, we discover that in response to retinal damage, a subset of cells expressing markers of microglia/macrophages also express markers of senescence. These cells display a temporal pattern of appearance and clearance during retina regeneration. Premature removal of senescent cells by senolytic treatment led to a decrease in proliferation and incomplete repair of the ganglion cell layer after NMDA damage. Our results demonstrate a role for modulation of senescent cell responses to balance inflammation, regeneration, plasticity, and repair as opposed to fibrosis and scarring."
"36710928","Gene-agnostic therapeutic approaches for inherited retinal degenerations.","Front Mol Neurosci","Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) are associated with mutations in over 250 genes and represent a major cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. While gene augmentation or gene editing therapies could address the underlying genetic mutations in a small subset of patients, their utility remains limited by the great genetic heterogeneity of IRDs and the costs of developing individualised therapies. Gene-agnostic therapeutic approaches target common pathogenic pathways that drive retinal degeneration or provide functional rescue of vision independent of the genetic cause, thus offering potential clinical benefits to all IRD patients. Here, we review the key gene-agnostic approaches, including retinal cell reprogramming and replacement, neurotrophic support, immune modulation and optogenetics. The relative benefits and limitations of these strategies and the timing of clinical interventions are discussed.Copyright © 2023 John, Quinn, Hu, Cehajic-Kapetanovic and Xue."
"36627108","Synthetic Biology Design as a Paradigm Shift toward Manufacturing Affordable Adeno-Associated Virus Gene Therapies.","ACS Synth Biol","Gene therapy has demonstrated enormous potential for changing how we combat disease. By directly engineering the genetic composition of cells, it provides a broad range of options for improving human health. Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) represent a leading gene therapy vector and are expected to address a wide range of conditions in the coming decade. Three AAV therapies have already been approved by the FDA to treat Leber's congenital amaurosis, spinal muscular atrophy, and hemophilia B. Yet these therapies cost around $850,000, $2,100,000, and $3,500,000, respectively. Such prices limit the broad applicability of AAV gene therapy and make it inaccessible to most patients. Much of this problem arises from the high manufacturing costs of AAVs. At the same time, the field of synthetic biology has grown rapidly and has displayed a special aptitude for addressing biomanufacturing problems. Here, we discuss emerging efforts to apply synthetic biology design to decrease the price of AAV production, and we propose that such efforts could play a major role in making gene therapy much more widely accessible."

The mechanisms underlying these associations have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we characterized the plasma proteomics profile of CVH and tested whether specific proteins mediated the associations between CVH and all-cause mortality in participants of the InCHIANTI study. Of the 1301 proteins tested, 92 proteins were associated with CVH (22 positively, 70 negatively). Proteins most strongly associated with CVH included leptin (LEP), fatty acid binding protein 3 (FABP3), Angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2), and growth-differential factor 15 (GDF15). Of the 92 CVH-associated proteins, 33 proteins significantly mediated the associations between CVH and all-cause mortality, with percent mediation ranging from 5 to 30%. The most significant mediating proteins were GDF15 and insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGFBP2). Proteins associated with better CVH were enriched for proteins that reflect the suppression of the complement coagulation and GH/IGF pathways."

Summary data of sarcopenia were obtained from a GWAS of 256,523 Europeans aged 60 years and over. The causal effects of the proteins were investigated by cis-Mendelian Randomisation (MR) and multiverse sensitivity analysis. We also explored the robust proteins' causal associations with appendicular lean mass (ALM) and surveyed their druggability and clinical development activities.In sum, 60 proteins from plasma proteome analysis studies and 12 from other studies were enrolled for MR analysis. In the whole population, four proteins (HPT, AT1B2, ISLR2 and TNF12) showed causal associations with the risk of sarcopenia according to the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) criterion. In the female population, AT1B2 and TNFSF12 revealed causal associations with sarcopenia risk according to the EWGSOP criterion; HGF revealed a negative association according to the National Institutes of Health criterion. All of them were druggable, and the inhibitors of TNF12 and HGF were evaluated in clinical trials for other diseases. TNF12 also revealed a negative causal association with ALM, whereas HGF was positively causally associated with ALM.Five druggable plasma proteins revealed causal associations with sarcopenia in the whole or female populations. TNF12 and HGF were the targets of therapeutic agents evaluated in clinical trials, and they were also causally associated with ALM.

The high incidence and mortality of breast cancer calls for improved prevention, diagnostics, and treatment, including identification of new prognostic and predictive biomarkers for use in precision medicine.With the aim of compiling a cohort amenable to integrative study designs, we collected detailed epidemiological and clinical data, blood samples, and tumor tissue from a subset of participants from the prospective, population-based Norwegian Women and Cancer (NOWAC) study. These study participants were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in North Norway before 2013 according to the Cancer Registry of Norway and constitute the Clinical and Multi-omic (CAMO) cohort. Prospectively collected questionnaire data on lifestyle and reproductive factors and blood samples were extracted from the NOWAC study, clinical and histopathological data were manually curated from medical records, and archived tumor tissue collected.The lifestyle and reproductive characteristics of the study participants in the CAMO cohort (n = 388) were largely similar to those of the breast cancer patients in NOWAC (n = 10 356). The majority of the cancers in the CAMO cohort were tumor grade 2 and of the luminal A subtype. Approx. 80% were estrogen receptor positive, 13% were HER2 positive, and 12% were triple negative breast cancers. Lymph node metastases were present in 31% at diagnosis. The epidemiological dataset in the CAMO cohort is complemented by mRNA, miRNA, and metabolomics analyses in plasma, as well as miRNA profiling in tumor tissue. Additionally, histological analyses at the level of proteins and miRNAs in tumor tissue are currently ongoing.The CAMO cohort provides data suitable for epidemiological, clinical, molecular, and multi-omics investigations, thereby enabling a systems epidemiology approach to translational breast cancer research.Copyright: © 2023 Delgado et al.

Organoids of the liver, kidney, intestine, lung, and brain have been developed in recent years. Human brain organoids are used for understanding pathogenesis and investigating therapeutic options for neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric, neurodegenerative, and neurological disorders. Theoretically, several brain disorders can be modeled with the aid of human brain organoids, and hence the potential exists for understanding migraine pathogenesis and its treatment with the aid of brain organoids. Migraine is considered a brain disorder with neurological and non-neurological abnormalities and symptoms. Both genetic and environmental factors play essential roles in migraine pathogenesis and its clinical manifestations. Several types of migraines are classified, for example, migraines with and without aura, and human brain organoids can be developed from patients with these types of migraines to study genetic factors (e.g., channelopathy in calcium channels) and environmental stressors (e.g., chemical and mechanical). In these models, drug candidates for therapeutic purposes can also be tested. Here, the potential and limitations of human brain organoids for studying migraine pathogenesis and its treatment are communicated to generate motivation and stimulate curiosity for further research. This must, however, be considered alongside the complexity of the concept of brain organoids and the neuroethical aspects of the topic. Interested researchers are invited to join the network for protocol development and testing the hypothesis presented here."
"36766763","The Breakthroughs and Caveats of Using Human Pluripotent Stem Cells in Modeling Alzheimer's Disease.","Cells","Modeling Alzheimer's disease (AD) using human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is a field now spanning 15 years. Developments in the field have shown a shift in using simple 2D cortical neuron models to more advanced tri-cultures and 3D cerebral organoids that recapitulate more features of the disease. This is largely due to development and optimization of new cell protocols. In this review, we highlight recent major breakthroughs in the AD field and the implications this has in modeling AD using iPSCs (AD-iPSCs). To date, AD-iPSCs have been largely used to recapitulate and study impaired amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and tau phosphorylation in both familial and sporadic AD. AD-iPSCs have also been studied for varying neuronal and glial dysfunctions. Moreover, they have been useful for discovering new molecular mechanisms, such as identifying proteins that bridge APP processing with tau phosphorylation and for identifying molecular pathways that bridge APP processing dysfunction with impaired cholesterol biosynthesis. Perhaps the greatest use of AD-iPSCs has been in discovering compounds via drug screening, that reduce amyloid beta (Aβ) in neurons, such as the anti-inflammatory compound, cromolyn, and antiparasitic drugs, avermectins. In addition, high content screening using AD-iPSCs has led to the identification of statins that can reduce levels of phosphorylated tau (p-Tau) in neurons. Some of these compounds have made it through to testing in human clinical trials. Improvements in omic technologies including single cell RNA sequencing and proteomics as well as advances in production of iPSC-cerebral organoids and tri-cultures is likely to result in the further discovery of new drugs and treatments for AD. Some caveats remain in the field, including, long experimental conditions to create mature neurons, high costs of media that limit research capabilities, and a lack of reproducibility using current iPSC-cerebral organoid protocols. Despite these current limitations, AD-iPSCs remain an excellent cellular model for studying AD mechanisms and for drug discovery."

The mutation is located within the amyloid beta (Aβ) domain of APP and leads to Aβ peptide accumulation in and around the cerebral vasculature. There lack of disease models to study the cellular and molecular pathological mechanisms of D-CAA together with the absence of a disease phenotype in vitro in overexpression cell models, as well as the limited availability of D-CAA animal models indicates the need for a D-CAA patient-derived model.We generated cerebral organoids from four D-CAA patients and four controls, cultured them up to 110 days and performed immunofluorescent and targeted gene expression analyses at two time points (D52 and D110).D-CAA cerebral organoids exhibited Aβ accumulations, showed enhanced neuronal and astrocytic gene expression and TGFβ pathway de-regulation.These results illustrate the potential of cerebral organoids as in vitro disease model of D-CAA that can be used to understand disease mechanisms of D-CAA and can serve as therapeutic intervention platform for various Aβ-related disorders.Copyright © 2023 Daoutsali, Pepers, Stamatakis, van der Graaf, Terwindt, Parfitt, Buijsen and van Roon-Mom."
"36688702","Global stabilizing control of large-scale biomolecular regulatory networks.","Bioinformatics","Cellular behavior is determined by complex non-linear interactions between numerous intracellular molecules that are often represented by Boolean network models. To achieve a desired cellular behavior with minimal intervention, we need to identify optimal control targets that can drive heterogeneous cellular states to the desired phenotypic cellular state with minimal node intervention. Previous attempts to realize such global stabilization were based solely on either network structure information or simple linear dynamics. Other attempts based on non-linear dynamics are not scalable.Here, we investigate the underlying relationship between structurally identified control targets and optimal global stabilizing control targets based on non-linear dynamics. We discovered that optimal global stabilizing control targets can be identified by analyzing the dynamics between structurally identified control targets. Utilizing these findings, we developed a scalable global stabilizing control framework using both structural and dynamic information. Our framework narrows down the search space based on strongly connected components and feedback vertex sets then identifies global stabilizing control targets based on the canalization of Boolean network dynamics. We find that the proposed global stabilizing control is superior with respect to the number of control target nodes, scalability, and computational complexity.We provide a GitHub repository that contains the DCGS framework written in Python as well as biological random Boolean network datasets (https://github.com/sugyun/DCGS).Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.© The Author(s) 2023.

These are critical factors affecting meat yield and quality. In this review, we have highlighted the recent advances in circRNA-related studies of skeletal muscle and adipose in farm animals. We have also described the biogenesis, properties, and biological functions of circRNAs.

However, the extent to which physical activity affects maternal biomarkers and factors that might influence birth weight remains unclear. We analysed data from two lifestyle interventions in which the effects of an exercise programme (2x/week, 60-90 min) on the course of pregnancy with regard to adipokines and offspring were evaluated. A total of 70 women participated in this study (45, intervention group; 25, control group). Anthropometric data and maternal fasting serum leptin and resistin levels were measured at three time points (approximately 14th (T1), 24th (T2), and 36th (T3) weeks of gestation). Neonatal/child data were retrieved from screening examinations. Independent of the intervention, we found a positive correlation between the fat mass at T1 and both leptin and resistin levels at all time points. Leptin level was significantly higher in the control group at T3; however, no differences between the groups were found for resistin. The birth weight was influenced by the birth length, fat mass at T1/T3, and resistin level at T2. The BMI-SDS at one year of age was influenced by maternal fat-free mass at T3 and resistin at T1/T2. Even if these results can only be interpreted cautiously, lifestyle interventions during pregnancy are important in promoting maternal and child health. Further randomised controlled trials and translational studies are warranted to clarify the underlying mechanisms."

However, most reported predictive models are constructed without a large enough sample size, and quantitative expression levels of their constituent serum miRNAs are susceptible to batch effects, decreasing their clinical applicability.We propose a general method for detecting qualitative serum predictive biomarkers using a large cohort of miRNA-profiled serum samples (n = 15,460) based on the within-sample relative expression orderings of miRNAs.Two panels of miRNA pairs (miRPairs) were developed. The first was composed of five serum miRPairs (5-miRPairs), reaching 100% diagnostic accuracy in three validation sets for distinguishing glioma and non-cancer controls (n = 436: glioma = 236, non-cancers = 200). An additional validation set without glioma samples (non-cancers = 2611) showed a predictive accuracy of 95.9%. The second panel included 32 serum miRPairs (32-miRPairs), reaching 100% diagnostic performance in training set on specifically discriminating glioma from other cancer types (sensitivity = 100%, specificity = 100%, accuracy = 100%), which was reproducible in five validation datasets (n = 3387: glioma = 236, non-glioma cancers = 3151, sensitivity> 97.9%, specificity> 99.5%, accuracy> 95.7%). In other brain diseases, the 5-miRPairs classified all non-neoplastic samples as non-cancer, including stroke (n = 165), Alzheimer's disease (n = 973), and healthy samples (n = 1820), and all neoplastic samples as cancer, including meningioma (n = 16), and primary central nervous system lymphoma samples (n = 39). The 32-miRPairs predicted 82.2 and 92.3% of the two kinds of neoplastic samples as positive, respectively. Based on the Human miRNA tissue atlas database, the glioma-specific 32-miRPairs were significantly enriched in the spinal cord (p = 0.013) and brain (p = 0.015).The identified 5-miRPairs and 32-miRPairs provide potential population screening and cancer-specific biomarkers for glioma clinical practice.© 2023.

High-throughput proteomic analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opened new opportunities for scrutinizing this heterogeneity. To date, this is the most comprehensive CSF-based proteomics profiling study in PD with 569 patients (350 idiopathic patients, 65 GBA + mutation carriers and 154 LRRK2 + mutation carriers), 534 controls, and 4135 proteins analyzed. Combining CSF aptamer-based proteomics with genetics we determined protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs). Analyses of pQTLs together with summary statistics from the largest PD genome wide association study (GWAS) identified 68 potential causal proteins by Mendelian randomization. The top causal protein, GPNMB, was previously reported to be upregulated in the substantia nigra of PD patients. We also compared the CSF proteomes of patients and controls. Proteome differences between GBA + patients and unaffected GBA + controls suggest degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, altered dopamine metabolism and increased brain inflammation. In the LRRK2 + subcohort we found dysregulated lysosomal degradation, altered alpha-synuclein processing, and neurotransmission. Proteome differences between idiopathic patients and controls suggest increased neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction/oxidative stress, altered iron metabolism and potential neuroprotection mediated by vasoactive substances. Finally, we used proteomic data to stratify idiopathic patients into ""endotypes"". The identified endotypes show differences in cognitive and motor disease progression based on previously reported protein-based risk scores.Our findings not only contribute to the identification of new therapeutic targets but also to shape personalized medicine in CNS neurodegeneration.© 2023.

However, it has limitation for single algorithm to explore the diagnosing value of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). We aim to develop a novel overall normalized sum weight of multiple-model MLs to assess the diagnosing value in DCM.Gene expression data were selected from previously published databases (six sets of eligible microarrays, 386 samples) with eligible criteria. Two sets of microarrays were used as training; the others were studied in the testing sets (ratio 5:1). Totally, we identified 20 differently expressed genes (DEGs) between DCM and control individuals (7 upregulated and 13 down-regulated).We developed six classification ML methods to identify potential candidate genes based on their overall weights. Three genes, serine proteinase inhibitor A3 (SERPINA3), frizzled-related proteins (FRPs) 3 (FRZB), and ficolin 3 (FCN3) were finally identified as the receiver operating characteristic (ROC). Interestingly, we found all three genes correlated considerably with plasma cells. Importantly, not only in training sets but also testing sets, the areas under the curve (AUCs) forSERPINA3,FRZB, andFCN3were greater than 0.88. The ROC ofSERPINA3was significantly high (0.940 in training and 0.918 in testing sets), indicating it is a potentially functional gene in DCM. Especially, the plasma levels in DCM patients of SERPINA3, FCN, and FRZB were significant compared with healthy control.SERPINA3, FRZB, and FCN3 might be potential diagnosis targets for DCM, Further verification work could be implemented.Copyright © 2023 Zhang, Lin, Wang, Han, Zhang, Gao, Li, Zhang, Zhou, Yu and Fu."

Allergen avoidance has long been the main focus in the prevention of food allergy and late solid food introduction after 6-12 months of age was recommended in high-risk infants. However, the rising prevalence of food allergy despite delayed exposure to allergens and the observations that IgE-mediated sensitization to food products could even occur before the introduction of solid foods resulted in a shift towards early solid food introduction as an attempt to prevent IgE-mediated food allergy. Since then, many trials focused on the clinical outcome of early allergen introduction and overall seem to point to a protective effect on the development of IgE-mediated food allergies. For non-IgE-mediated diseases of food allergy, evidence of early food introduction seems less clear. Moreover, data on the underlying immunological processes in early food introduction is lacking. The goal of this review is to summarize the available data of immunological changes in early food introduction to prevent IgE and non-IgE mediated food allergy.© 2023 Nuyttens, De Vlieger, Diels, Schrijvers and Bullens."

The FaST-LMM and R packages were used for all statistical analyses.For the case-control analysis, the genomic inflation factor (λ) was 1.016, rs149768622 T>C in the first intron ofWWC2gene showed the strongest association with a P value of 3.76E-08 and odds ratio (OR) of 13.24 (95% CI: 3.91-44.78).

"36879033","Psychotic disorders as a framework for precision psychiatry.","Nat Rev Neurol","People with psychotic disorders can show marked interindividual variations in the onset of illness, responses to treatment and relapse, but they receive broadly similar clinical care. Precision psychiatry is an approach that aims to stratify people with a given disorder according to different clinical outcomes and tailor treatment to their individual needs. At present, interindividual differences in outcomes of psychotic disorders are difficult to predict on the basis of clinical assessment alone. Therefore, current research in psychosis seeks to build models that predict outcomes by integrating clinical information with a range of biological measures. Here, we review recent progress in the application of precision psychiatry to psychotic disorders and consider the challenges associated with implementing this approach in clinical practice.© 2023.

"36878965","The molecular pathology of schizophrenia: an overview of existing knowledge and new directions for future research.","Mol Psychiatry","Despite enormous efforts employing various approaches, the molecular pathology in the schizophrenia brain remains elusive. On the other hand, the knowledge of the association between the disease risk and changes in the DNA sequences, in other words, our understanding of the genetic pathology of schizophrenia, has dramatically improved over the past two decades. As the consequence, now we can explain more than 20% of the liability to schizophrenia by considering all analyzable common genetic variants including those with weak or no statistically significant association. Also, a large-scale exome sequencing study identified single genes whose rare mutations substantially increase the risk for schizophrenia, of which six genes (SETD1A, CUL1, XPO7, GRIA3, GRIN2A, and RB1CC1) showed odds ratios larger than ten. Based on these findings together with the preceding discovery of copy number variants (CNVs) with similarly large effect sizes, multiple disease models with high etiological validity have been generated and analyzed. Studies of the brains of these models, as well as transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses of patient postmortem tissues, have provided new insights into the molecular pathology of schizophrenia. In this review, we overview the current knowledge acquired from these studies, their limitations, and directions for future research that may redefine schizophrenia based on biological alterations in the responsible organ rather than operationalized criteria.© 2023.

"36829893","Relationship between Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency, X-Chromosome Inactivation and Inflammatory Markers.","Antioxidants (Basel)","Recent studies suggest that X-linked glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency entails a proinflammatory state that may increase the risk of several disease conditions. However, it is not clear how this relates to the degree of enzyme insufficiency and, in heterozygous females, to skewed inactivation of the X chromosome. This study aimed to (i) investigate the enzyme activity in a cohort of 232 subjects (54.3% females) from Northern Sardinia, Italy, further stratified into three subgroups (G6PD normal, partial deficiency and total deficiency); (ii) measure the levels of some non-specific inflammatory markers, such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and those derived from cell counts, such as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), in relation to the underlying molecular defect and X inactivation. G6PD activity was measured in red blood cells according to G6PD/6PGD ratio, and X-chromosome inactivation was assessed by the HUMARA method. Overall, ESR was increased in males with total deficiency compared with normal males (15.0 ± 7.2 vs. 11.9 ± 6.2,p= 0.002, Tukey's test), albeit not in males with partial deficiency. High-sensitivity CRP was slightly increased in males with total deficiency, compared to males with normal G6PD activity (5.96 ± 3.39 vs. 3.95 ± 2.96,p= 0.048). In females, neither marker showed significant differences across the subgroups. MLR was significantly and progressively increased from normal to totally deficient subjects with intermediate values in partially deficient subjects (0.18, 0.31 and 0.37, ANOVAp= 0.008). The NLR and PLR were not different in the three subgroups. Our findings show that G6PD deficiency may be associated with a proinflammatory profile, especially in elderly females, and worsened by the concomitant asymmetric inactivation of the X chromosome."
"36718450",NA,NA,"Island bat species are disproportionately at risk of extinction, and Hawai'i's only native terrestrial land mammal, the Hawaiian hoary bat (Lasiurus semotus)locally known as 'ōpe'ape'a, is no exception. To effectively manage this bat species with an archipelago-wide distribution, it is important to determine the population size on each island and connectivity between islands. We used 18 nuclear microsatellite loci and one mitochondrial gene from 339 individuals collected from 1988-2020 to evaluate genetic diversity, population structure and estimate effective population size on the Islands of Hawai'i, Maui, O'ahu, and Kaua'i. Genetic differentiation occurred between Hawai'i and Maui, both of which were differentiated from O'ahu and Kaua'i. The population on Maui presents the greatest per-island genetic diversity, consistent with their hypothesized status as the original founding population. A signature of isolation by distance was detected between islands, with contemporary migration analyses indicating limited gene flow in recent generations, and male-biased sex dispersal within Maui. Historical and long-term estimates of genetic effective population sizes were generally larger than contemporary estimates, although estimates of contemporary genetic effective population size lacked upper bounds in confidence intervals for Hawai'i and Kaua'i. Contemporary genetic effective population sizes were smaller on O'ahu and Maui. We also detected evidence of past bottlenecks on all islands with the exception of Hawai'i. Our study provides population-level estimates for the genetic diversity and geographic structure of 'ōpe'ape'a, that could be used by agencies tasked with wildlife conservation in Hawai'i."

Moreover, less is known about gene expression in response to fatal overdose. The primary goal of the present study was to compare gene expression in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) between brain samples of individuals who died of acute opioid intoxication and group-matched controls.Postmortem tissue samples of the DLPFC from 153 deceased individuals (Mage = 35.4; 62% male; 77% European ancestry). Study groups included 72 brain samples from individuals who died of acute opioid intoxication, 53 psychiatric controls, and 28 normal controls. Whole transcriptome RNA-sequencing was used to generate exon counts, and differential expression was tested usinglimma-voom. Analyses were adjusted for relevant sociodemographic characteristics, technical covariates, and cryptic relatedness using quality surrogate variables. Weighted correlation network analysis and gene set enrichment analyses also were conducted.Two genes were differentially expressed in opioid samples compared to control samples. The top gene,NPAS4, was downregulated in opioid samples (log2FC = -2.47, adj.p = .049) and has been implicated in opioid, cocaine, and methamphetamine use. Weighted correlation network analysis revealed 15 gene modules associated with opioid overdose, though no intramodular hub genes were related to opioid overdose, nor were pathways related to opioid overdose enriched for differential expression.Results provide preliminary evidence thatNPAS4is implicated in opioid overdose, and more research is needed to understand its role in opioid abuse and associated outcomes.© 2022 The Author(s).

To refine previously reported gene signatures of neurobiological alterations in OUD from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann Area 9, BA9), we explored the role of microRNAs (miRNA) as powerful epigenetic regulators of gene function.Building on the growing appreciation that miRNAs can cross the blood-brain barrier, we carried out miRNA profiling in same-subject postmortem samples from BA9 and blood tissues.miRNA-mRNA network analysis showed that even though miRNAs identified in BA9 and blood were fairly distinct, their target genes and corresponding enriched pathways overlapped strongly. Among the dominant enriched biological processes were tissue development and morphogenesis, and MAPK signaling pathways. These findings point to robust, redundant, and systemic opioid-induced miRNA dysregulation with a potential functional impact on transcriptomic changes. Further, using correlation network analysis, we identified cell-type specific miRNA targets, specifically in astrocytes, neurons, and endothelial cells, associated with OUD transcriptomic dysregulation. Finally, leveraging a collection of control brain transcriptomes from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, we identified a correlation of OUD miRNA targets with TGF beta, hypoxia, angiogenesis, coagulation, immune system, and inflammatory pathways.These findings support previous reports of neurovascular and immune system alterations as a consequence of opioid abuse and shed new light on miRNA network regulators of cellular response to opioid drugs.Copyright © 2023 Grimm, Mendez, Stertz, Meyer, Fries, Gandhi, Kanchi, Selvaraj, Teixeira, Kosten, Gunaratne, Coarfa and Walss-Bass."

Differential expression was integrated with loci-specific alterations in DNA-methylation and chromatin marks in MM patients. A CRISPR-based targeted induction of DNA-methylation at the ITGB7 super-enhancer (SE) in MM.1S cells was employed to intersect the impact of cis-regulatory elements on ITGB7 expression.ITGB7 was significantly (p < 0.05) upregulated in patients with t(14;16) and t(14;20) subgroups in all MGUS, SMM and MM stages, but sporadically upregulated in t(4;14) subgroup at the MM stage. We demonstrate a predetermined enhancer state on ITGB7 in primary-B cells that is maintained under bivalent chromatin, which undergoes a process of chromatin-state alterations and develops into an active enhancer in cases of the t(4;14) subgroup or SE in cases of the t(14;16) subgroup. We also demonstrate that while targeted induction of DNA-methylation at the ITGB7-SE further upregulated the gene, inhibition of ITGB7-SE-associated transcription factor bromodomain-4 downregulated expression of the gene.Our findings suggest an epigenetic regulation of oncogenic overexpression of ITGB7 in MM cells, which could be critical in MM progression and an attractive therapeutic target.© 2023.

"36656865","Enhancer-promoter entanglement explains their transcriptional interdependence.","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","Enhancers not only activate target promoters to stimulate messenger RNA (mRNA) synthesis, but they themselves also undergo transcription to produce enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), the significance of which is not well understood. Transcription at the participating enhancer-promoter pair appears coordinated, but it is unclear why and how. Here, we employ cell-free transcription assays using constructs derived from the humanGREB1locus to demonstrate that transcription at an enhancer and its target promoter is interdependent. This interdependence is observable under conditions where direct enhancer-promoter contact (EPC) takes place. We demonstrate that transcription activation at a participating enhancer-promoter pair is dependent on i) the mutual availability of the enhancer and promoter, ii) the state of transcription at both the enhancer and promoter, iii) local abundance of both eRNA and mRNA, and iv) direct EPC. Our results suggest transcriptional interdependence between the enhancer and the promoter as the basis of their transcriptional concurrence and coordination throughout the genome. We propose a model where transcriptional concurrence, coordination and interdependence are possible if the participating enhancer and promoter are entangled in the form of EPC, reside in a proteinaceous bubble, and utilize shared transcriptional resources and regulatory inputs."

Next, we meta-analyzed transcriptomic and epigenomic data of AD patients to search for commonalities with genes and pathways previously connected to music in genome association, epigenetic, and gene expression studies.Our findings indicate that >93% of the neuroscience/ cognitive sciences studies indicate at least one beneficial effect of music on patients with neurodegenerative diseases, being improvements on memory and cognition the most frequent outcomes; other common benefits were on social behavior, mood and emotion, anxiety and agitation, quality of life, and depression. Out of the 334 music-related genes, 127 (38%) were found to be linked to epigenome/transcriptome analysis in AD (vs. healthy controls); some of them (SNCA, SLC6A4, ASCC2, FTH1, PLAURandARHGAP26) have been reported to be associated e.g. with musical aptitude and music effect on the transcriptome. Other music-related genes (GMPR, SELENBP1andADIPOR1) associated to neuropsychiatric, neurodegenerative diseases and music performance, emerged as hub genes in consensus co-expression modules detected between AD and music estimulated transcriptomes. In addition, we found connections between music, AD and dopamine related genes, with SCNA being the most remarkable - a gene previously associated with learning and memory, and neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Parkinson's disease and AD).The present study indicate that the vast majority of neuroscientific studies unambiguously show that music has a beneficial effect on health, being the most common benefits relevant to Alzheimer's disease.

This review summarises genetic and epigenetic data from human studies to understand the etiological and clinical heterogeneity of schizophrenia. Gene expression studies using microarray and sequencing technologies reported the aberrant transcription of numerous genes in the PFC in patients with schizophrenia. Altered gene expression in schizophrenia is related to several biological pathways and networks (synaptic function, neurotransmission, signalling, myelination, immune/inflammatory mechanisms, energy production and response to oxidative stress). Studies investigating mechanisms driving these transcriptional abnormalities focused on alternations in transcription factors, gene promoter elements, DNA methylation, posttranslational histone modifications or posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression mediated by non-coding RNAs."

The pandemic has been facilitated by the intermittent emergence of variant strains, which has been explained and classified mainly by the patterns of point mutations of the spike (S) gene. However, the profiles of insertions/deletions (indels) in SARS-CoV-2 genomes during the pandemic remain largely unevaluated yet.In this study, we first screened for the genome regions of polymorphic indel sites by performing multiple sequence alignment; then, NCBI BLAST search and GISAID database search were performed to comprehensively investigate the indel profiles at the polymorphic indel hotspot and elucidate the emergence and spread of the indels in time and geographical distribution.A polymorphic indel hotspot was identified in the N-terminal domain of theSgene at approximately 22,200 nucleotide position, corresponding to 210-215 amino acid positions of SARS-CoV-2 S protein. This polymorphic hotspot was comprised of adjacent 3-base deletion (5'-ATT-3'; Spike_N211del) and 9-base insertion (5'-AGCCAGAAG-3'; Spike_ins214EPE). By performing NCBI BLAST search and GISAID database search, we identified several types of tandem repeats of the 9-base insertion, creating an 18-base insertion (Spike_ins214EPEEPE, Spike_ins214EPDEPE). The results of the searches suggested that the two-cycle tandem repeats of the 9-base insertion were created in November 2021 in Central Europe, whereas the emergence of the original one-cycle 9-base insertion (Spike_ins214EPE) would date back to the middle of 2020 and was away from the Central Europe. The identified 18-base insertions based on 2-cycle tandem repeat of the 9-base insertion were collected between November 2021 and April 2022, suggesting that these mutations could not survive and have been already eliminated.The GISAID database search implied that this polymorphic indel hotspot to be with one of the highest tolerability for incorporating indels in SARS-CoV-2 S gene. In summary, the present study identified a variable number of tandem repeat of 9-base insertion in the N-terminal domain of SARS-CoV-2 S gene, and the repeat could have occurred at different time from the insertion of the original 9-base insertion.Copyright © 2023 Akaishi, Fujiwara and Ishii."

The mechanisms which translate changes in 3D genome structure into changes in transcription, however, are not fully understood. Here, we use a comprehensive genomic analysis of cells lacking nuclear β-actin to investigate the mechanistic links between compartment organization, enhancer activity, and gene expression.Using HiC-Seq, ATAC-Seq, and RNA-Seq, we first demonstrate that transcriptional and chromatin accessibility changes observed upon β-actin loss are highly enriched in compartment-switching regions. Accessibility changes within compartment switching genes, however, are mainly observed in non-promoter regions which potentially represent distal regulatory elements. Our results also show that β-actin loss induces widespread accumulation of the enhancer-specific epigenetic mark H3K27ac. Using the ABC model of enhancer annotation, we then establish that these epigenetic changes have a direct impact on enhancer activity and underlie transcriptional changes observed upon compartment switching. A complementary analysis of fibroblasts undergoing reprogramming into pluripotent stem cells further confirms that this relationship between compartment switching and enhancer-dependent transcriptional change is not specific to β-actin knockout cells but represents a general mechanism linking compartment-level genome organization to gene expression.We demonstrate that enhancer-dependent transcriptional regulation plays a crucial role in driving gene expression changes observed upon compartment-switching. Our results also reveal a novel function of nuclear β-actin in regulating enhancer function by influencing H3K27 acetylation levels.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36691074","An atlas of lamina-associated chromatin across twelve human cell types reveals an intermediate chromatin subtype.","Genome Biol","Association of chromatin with lamin proteins at the nuclear periphery has emerged as a potential mechanism to coordinate cell type-specific gene expression and maintain cellular identity via gene silencing. Unlike many histone modifications and chromatin-associated proteins, lamina-associated domains (LADs) are mapped genome-wide in relatively few genetically normal human cell types, which limits our understanding of the role peripheral chromatin plays in development and disease.To address this gap, we map LAMIN B1 occupancy across twelve human cell types encompassing pluripotent stem cells, intermediate progenitors, and differentiated cells from all three germ layers. Integrative analyses of this atlas with gene expression and repressive histone modification maps reveal that lamina-associated chromatin in all twelve cell types is organized into at least two subtypes defined by differences in LAMIN B1 occupancy, gene expression, chromatin accessibility, transposable elements, replication timing, and radial positioning. Imaging of fluorescently labeled DNA in single cells validates these subtypes and shows radial positioning of LADs with higher LAMIN B1 occupancy and heterochromatic histone modifications primarily embedded within the lamina. In contrast, the second subtype of lamina-associated chromatin is relatively gene dense, accessible, dynamic across development, and positioned adjacent to the lamina. Most genes gain or lose LAMIN B1 occupancy consistent with cell types along developmental trajectories; however, we also identify examples where the enhancer, but not the gene body and promoter, changes LAD state.Altogether, this atlas represents the largest resource to date for peripheral chromatin organization studies and reveals an intermediate chromatin subtype.© 2023.

Here, we present a novel comprehensive framework Dr.Nod for detection of non-coding cis-regulatory candidate driver mutations that are associated with dysregulated gene expression using tissue-matched enhancer-gene annotations. Applying the framework to data from over 1500 tumours across eight tissues revealed a 4.4-fold enrichment of candidate driver mutations in regulatory regions of known cancer driver genes. An overarching conclusion that emerges is that the non-coding driver mutations contribute to cancer by significantly altering transcription factor binding sites, leading to upregulation of tissue-matched oncogenes and down-regulation of tumour-suppressor genes. Interestingly, more than half of the detected cancer-promoting non-coding regulatory driver mutations are over 20 kb distant from the cancer-associated genes they regulate. Our results show the importance of tissue-matched enhancer-gene maps, functional impact of mutations, and complex background mutagenesis model for the prediction of non-coding regulatory drivers.

After adjusting for confounders, including the maternal characteristics and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, the effect of WBC count on FF and test failure rate was measured by linear and logistic regression analyses.Fetal fraction was negatively associated with BMI, ALT, IVF conceptions, and WBC count and positively correlated with gestational age in the multivariate linear regression model. Moreover, WBC count was the most important factor affecting FF after BMI according to the standardization coefficient analysis. In the 4,281 pregnancy samples with male fetuses, FF decreased with WBC count from 11.45% at ≤8 to 9.02% at >12, and FF markedly decreased to 7.40% in pregnancies with a higher WBC count (>12) and higher BMI (≥25 kg/m2). Meanwhile, the test failure rates were significantly higher in the WBC count > 12 group (4.29%) than in the WBC count ≤ 8 group (0.89%). Notably, when the BMI of pregnancies with a WBC count of >12 was >25, the rate reached 7.53%. Subsequently, multivariate logistic regression analysis further confirmed that an increased BMI and WBC count were independently and significantly associated with the test failure rates.An increased WBC count was associated with lower FF and higher test failure rates, suggesting that these important factors should be carefully considered during genetic counseling in pregnant women who decide to undergo blood collection or resampling.Copyright © 2023 Qiao, Cao, Tang, Yu, Shi, Xue, Wang, Liang, Huang and Wang."

The dynamic nature of this intercellular variation, where individual cells can transition between different states over time, makes it a particularly hard phenomenon to characterize. We reviewed recent progress in leveraging the classical Luria-Delbrück experiment to infer the transient heritability of the cellular states. Similar to the original experiment, individual cells were first grown into cell colonies, and then, the fraction of cells residing in different states was assayed for each colony. We discuss modeling approaches for capturing dynamic state transitions in a growing cell population and highlight formulas that identify the kinetics of state switching from the extent of colony-to-colony fluctuations. The utility of this method in identifying multi-generational memory of the both expression and phenotypic states is illustrated across diverse biological systems from cancer drug resistance, reactivation of human viruses, and cellular immune responses. In summary, this fluctuation-based methodology provides a powerful approach for elucidating cell-state transitions from asingletime point measurement, which is particularly relevant in situations where measurements lead to cell death (as in single-cell RNA-seq or drug treatment) or cause an irreversible change in cell physiology.Copyright © 2023 Singh and Saint-Antoine."

Innovative single-cell approaches revealed that the initiation of IFN-I production is limited to only fractions of 1-3% of the total population, both found in vitro, in vivo, and across cell types, which were thought to be stochastically regulated. To challenge this dogma, we addressed the influence of various stochastic and deterministic host-intrinsic factors on dictating early IFN-I responses, using a murine fibroblast reporter model. Epigenetic drugs influenced the percentage of responding cells. Next, with the classical Luria-Delbrück fluctuation test, we provided evidence for transient heritability driving responder fates, which was verified with mathematical modeling. Finally, while studying varying cell densities, we substantiated an important role for cell density in dictating responsiveness, similar to the phenomenon of quorum sensing. Together, this systems immunology approach opens up new avenues to progress the fundamental understanding on cellular decision-making during early IFN-I responses, which can be translated to other (immune) signaling systems.© 2023, Van Eyndhoven et al."
"36852268","Pangenome obtained by long-read sequencing of 11 genomes reveal hidden functional structural variants in pigs.","iScience","Long-read sequencing (LRS) facilitates both the genome assembly and the discovery of structural variants (SVs). Here, we built a graph-based pig pangenome by incorporating 11 LRS genomes with an average of 94.01% BUSCO completeness score, revealing 206-Mb novel sequences. We discovered 183,352 nonredundant SVs (63% novel), representing 12.12% of the reference genome. By genotyping SVs in an additional 196 short-read sequencing samples, we identified thousands of population stratified SVs. Particularly, we detected 7,568 Tibetan specific SVs, some of which demonstrate significant population differentiation between Tibetan and low-altitude pigs, which might be associated with the high-altitude hypoxia adaptation in Tibetan pigs. Further integrating functional genomic data, the most promising candidate genes within the SVs that might contribute to the high-altitude hypoxia adaptation were discovered. Overall, our study generates a benchmark pangenome resource for illustrating the important roles of SVs in adaptive evolution, domestication, and genetic improvement of agronomic traits in pigs.© 2023 The Authors."
"36797493","Telomere-to-telomere assembly of diploid chromosomes with Verkko.","Nat Biotechnol","The Telomere-to-Telomere consortium recently assembled the first truly complete sequence of a human genome. To resolve the most complex repeats, this project relied on manual integration of ultra-long Oxford Nanopore sequencing reads with a high-resolution assembly graph built from long, accurate PacBio high-fidelity reads. We have improved and automated this strategy in Verkko, an iterative, graph-based pipeline for assembling complete, diploid genomes. Verkko begins with a multiplex de Bruijn graph built from long, accurate reads and progressively simplifies this graph by integrating ultra-long reads and haplotype-specific markers. The result is a phased, diploid assembly of both haplotypes, with many chromosomes automatically assembled from telomere to telomere. Running Verkko on the HG002 human genome resulted in 20 of 46 diploid chromosomes assembled without gaps at 99.9997% accuracy. The complete assembly of diploid genomes is a critical step towards the construction of comprehensive pangenome databases and chromosome-scale comparative genomics.© 2023.

However, the previously released versions of kiwifruit genomes all have a mass of unanchored or missing regions. Here, we report a highly continuous and completely gap-free reference genome ofActinidia chinensiscv. 'Hongyang', named Hongyang v4.0, which is the first to achieve twode novohaploid-resolved haplotypes, HY4P and HY4A. HY4P and HY4A have a total length of 606.1 and 599.6 Mb, respectively, with almost the entire telomeres and centromeres assembled in each haplotype. In comparison with Hongyang v3.0, the integrity and contiguity of Hongyang v4.0 is markedly improved by filling all unclosed gaps and correcting some misoriented regions, resulting in ~38.6-39.5 Mb extra sequences, which might affect 4263 and 4244 protein-coding genes in HY4P and HY4A, respectively. Furthermore, our gap-free genome assembly provides the first clue for inspecting the structure and function of centromeres. Globally, centromeric regions are characterized by higher-order repeats that mainly consist of a 153-bp conserved centromere-specific monomer (Ach-CEN153) with different copy numbers among chromosomes. Functional enrichment analysis of the genes located within centromeric regions demonstrates that chromosome centromeres may not only play physical roles for linking a pair of sister chromatids, but also have genetic features for participation in the regulation of cell division. The availability of the telomere-to-telomere and gap-free Hongyang v4.0 reference genome lays a solid foundation not only for illustrating genome structure and functional genomics studies but also for facilitating kiwifruit breeding and improvement.© The Author(s) 2023.

"36755311","Human Satellite 1A analysis provides evidence of pericentromeric transcription.","BMC Biol","Pericentromeric regions of human chromosomes are composed of tandem-repeated and highly organized sequences named satellite DNAs. Human classical satellite DNAs are classified into three families named HSat1, HSat2, and HSat3, which have historically posed a challenge for the assembly of the human reference genome where they are misrepresented due to their repetitive nature. Although being known for a long time as the most AT-rich fraction of the human genome, classical satellite HSat1A has been disregarded in genomic and transcriptional studies, falling behind other human satellites in terms of functional knowledge. Here, we aim to characterize and provide an understanding on the biological relevance of HSat1A.The path followed herein trails with HSat1A isolation and cloning, followed by in silico analysis. Monomer copy number and expression data was obtained in a wide variety of human cell lines, with greatly varying profiles in tumoral/non-tumoral samples. HSat1A was mapped in human chromosomes and applied in in situ transcriptional assays. Additionally, it was possible to observe the nuclear organization of HSat1A transcripts and further characterize them by 3' RACE-Seq. Size-varying polyadenylated HSat1A transcripts were detected, which possibly accounts for the intricate regulation of alternative polyadenylation.As far as we know, this work pioneers HSat1A transcription studies. With the emergence of new human genome assemblies, acrocentric pericentromeres are becoming relevant characters in disease and other biological contexts. HSat1A sequences and associated noncoding RNAs will most certainly prove significant in the future of HSat research.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36768893","Chrono-Nutrition: Circadian Rhythm and Personalized Nutrition.","Int J Mol Sci","The human circadian system has a period of approximately 24 h and studies on the consequences of ""chornodisruption"" have greatly expanded. Lifestyle and environmental factors of modern societies (i.e., artificial lighting, jetlag, shift work, and around-the-clock access to energy-dense food) can induce disruptions of the circadian system and thereby adversely affect individual health. Growing evidence demonstrates a complex reciprocal relationship between metabolism and the circadian system, in which perturbations in one system affect the other one. From a nutritional genomics perspective, genetic variants in clock genes can both influence metabolic health and modify the individual response to diet. Moreover, an interplay between the circadian rhythm, gut microbiome, and epigenome has been demonstrated, with the diet in turn able to modulate this complex link suggesting a remarkable plasticity of the underlying mechanisms. In this view, the study of the impact of the timing of eating by matching elements from nutritional research with chrono-biology, that is, chrono-nutrition, could have significant implications for personalized nutrition in terms of reducing the prevalence and burden of chronic diseases. This review provides an overview of the current evidence on the interactions between the circadian system and nutrition, highlighting how this link could in turn influence the epigenome and microbiome. In addition, possible nutritional strategies to manage circadian-aligned feeding are suggested."

The microtubule cytoskeleton is involved in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks; however, little is known about which cytoskeleton-related proteins are involved in DNA repair and how. Using quantitative proteomics, we discovered that microtubule associated proteins MAP7 and MAP7D1 interact with several DNA repair proteins including DNA double-strand break repair proteins RAD50, BRCA1 and 53BP1. We observed that downregulation of MAP7 and MAP7D1 leads to increased phosphorylation of p53 after γ-irradiation. Moreover, we determined that the downregulation of MAP7D1 leads to a strong G1 arrest and that the downregulation of MAP7 and MAP7D1 in G1 arrested cells negatively affects DNA repair, recruitment of RAD50 to chromatin and localization of 53BP1 to the sites of damage. These findings describe for the first time a novel function of MAP7 and MAP7D1 in cell cycle regulation and repair of DNA double-strand breaks.© 2023 The Authors."

Cataract surgery is one of the most frequently performed surgeries, and the outcome is typically excellent if there is no concomitant pathology present in the visual pathway. In contrast, patients with DR, ARMD and glaucoma often develop significant visual impairment. These often-multifactorial eye problems can have genetic and hereditary components, with recent data supporting the role of DNA damage and repair as significant pathogenic factors. In this article, we discuss the role of DNA damage and the repair deficit in the development of DR, ARMD and glaucoma."
"36833412","A Chemoptogenetic Tool for Spatiotemporal Induction of Oxidative DNA Lesions In Vivo.","Genes (Basel)","Oxidative nuclear DNA damage increases in all tissues with age in multiple animal models, as well as in humans. However, the increase in DNA oxidation varies from tissue to tissue, suggesting that certain cells/tissues may be more vulnerable to DNA damage than others. The lack of a tool that can control dosage and spatiotemporal induction of oxidative DNA damage, which accumulates with age, has severely limited our ability to understand how DNA damage drives aging and age-related diseases. To overcome this, here we developed a chemoptogenetic tool that produces 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) at DNA in a whole organism,Caenorhabditis elegans. This tool uses di-iodinated malachite green (MG-2I) photosensitizer dye that generates singlet oxygen,1O2, upon fluorogen activating peptide (FAP) binding and excitation with far-red light. Using our chemoptogenetic tool, we are able to control generation of singlet oxygen ubiquitously or in a tissue-specific manner, including in neurons and muscle cells. To induce oxidative DNA damage, we targeted our chemoptogenetic tool to histone,his-72,that is expressed in all cell types. Our results show that a single exposure to dye and light is able to induce DNA damage, promote embryonic lethality, lead to developmental delay, and significantly reduce lifespan. Our chemoptogenetic tool will now allow us to assess the cell autonomous versus non-cell autonomous role of DNA damage in aging, at an organismal level."
"36792830","A NPAS4-NuA4 complex couples synaptic activity to DNA repair.","Nature","Neuronal activity is crucial for adaptive circuit remodelling but poses an inherent risk to the stability of the genome across the long lifespan of postmitotic neurons1-5. Whether neurons have acquired specialized genome protection mechanisms that enable them to withstand decades of potentially damaging stimuli during periods of heightened activity is unknown. Here we identify an activity-dependent DNA repair mechanism in which a new form of the NuA4-TIP60 chromatin modifier assembles in activated neurons around the inducible, neuronal-specific transcription factor NPAS4. We purify this complex from the brain and demonstrate its functions in eliciting activity-dependent changes to neuronal transcriptomes and circuitry. By characterizing the landscape of activity-induced DNA double-strand breaks in the brain, we show that NPAS4-NuA4 binds to recurrently damaged regulatory elements and recruits additional DNA repair machinery to stimulate their repair. Gene regulatory elements bound by NPAS4-NuA4 are partially protected against age-dependent accumulation of somatic mutations. Impaired NPAS4-NuA4 signalling leads to a cascade of cellular defects, including dysregulated activity-dependent transcriptional responses, loss of control over neuronal inhibition and genome instability, which all culminate to reduce organismal lifespan. In addition, mutations in several components of the NuA4 complex are reported to lead to neurodevelopmental and autism spectrum disorders. Together, these findings identify a neuronal-specific complex that couples neuronal activity directly to genome preservation, the disruption of which may contribute to developmental disorders, neurodegeneration and ageing.© 2023.

Consequently, the development and validation of novel NAD-boosting strategies has been of central interest, along with the development of models that accurately represent the complexity of human NAD dynamics and deficiency levels. In this review, we discuss pioneering research and show how modern researchers have long since moved past believing that pellagra is the overt and most dramatic clinical presentation of NAD deficiency. The current research is centered on common human health conditions associated with moderate, but clinically relevant, NAD deficiency. In vitro and in vivo research models that have been developed specifically to study NAD deficiency are reviewed here, along with emerging strategies to increase the intracellular NAD concentrations."

DDT is conserved in all domains of life, yet its relevance in mammals remains unclear. Here, we show that inactivation of both PCNA-ubiquitination and REV1 results in embryonic and adult lethality, and the accumulation of DNA damage in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) that ultimately resulted in their depletion. Our results reveal the crucial relevance of DDT in the maintenance of stem cell compartments and mammalian life in unperturbed conditions."

Here we combined nascent RNA sequencing and RNA polymerase II chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing to elucidate the underlying mechanisms triggering gene expression changes in wild-type aged mice. We found that in 2-year-old liver, 40% of elongating RNA polymerases are stalled, lowering productive transcription and skewing transcriptional output in a gene-length-dependent fashion. We demonstrate that this transcriptional stress is caused by endogenous DNA damage and explains the majority of gene expression changes in aging in most mainly postmitotic organs, specifically affecting aging hallmark pathways such as nutrient sensing, autophagy, proteostasis, energy metabolism, immune function and cellular stress resilience. Age-related transcriptional stress is evolutionary conserved from nematodes to humans. Thus, accumulation of stochastic endogenous DNA damage during aging deteriorates basal transcription, which establishes the age-related transcriptome and causes dysfunction of key aging hallmark pathways, disclosing how DNA damage functionally underlies major aspects of normal aging.© 2023.

The purpose of this review is to outline the genetic and epigenetic differences in brain cells during aging in males and females. As a result, we hereby show that the presence of brain aging patterns in males and females is due to a complex of factors associated with the effects of sex chromosomes, which subsequently entails a change in signal cascades in somatic cells."

The four benefits examined are: (1) improving women's health in late life; (2) increasing reproductive longevity and improving maternal health, (3) reducing the financial vulnerability many women experience at advanced ages (especially in the developing world); and (4) reducing the caring burdens which typically fall, at least disproportionately, on daughters to care for their ageing parents.

CD5+ B-1 cell NAbs recognize evolutionarily fixed epitopes, such as phosphatidylcholine (PtC), found on bacteria and senescent red blood cells. Anti-PtC antibodies are essential in protection against bacterial sepsis. CD5+ B-1 cell-derived NAbs have a unique germline-like structure that lacks N-additions, a feature critical for providing protection against infection. Previously, we demonstrated the repertoire and germline status of PtC+CD5+ B-1 cell IgM obtained from male mice changes with age depending on the anatomical location of the B-1 cells. More recently, we demonstrated serum antibody from aged female mice maintains protection against pneumococcal infection, whereas serum antibody from male mice does not provide protection.Here, we show that aged female mice have significantly more splenic PtC+CD5+ B-1 cells and more PtC specific serum IgM than aged male mice. Furthermore, we find both age and biological sex related repertoire differences when comparing B cell receptor (BCR) sequencing results of PtC+CD5+ B-1 cells. While BCR germline status of PtC+CD5+ B-1 cells from aged male and female mice is similar in the peritoneal cavity, it differs significantly in the spleen, where aged females retain germline configuration and aged males do not. Nucleic acid sensing toll-like receptors are critical in the maintenance of PtC+ B-1 cells; therefore, to begin to understand the mechanism of differences observed between the male and female PtC+CD5+ B-1 cell repertoire, we analyzed levels of cell-free nucleic acids and found increases in aged females.Our results suggest the antigenic milieu differs between aged males and females, leading to differential selection of antigen-specific B-1 cells over time. Further elucidation of how biological sex differences influence the maintenance of B-1 cells within the aging environment will be essential to understand sex and age-related disparities in the susceptibility to bacterial infection and will aid in the development of more effective vaccination and/or therapeutic strategies specific for males and females.Copyright © 2023 Webster, Tsuji, Clemente and Holodick."

Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the relationship between frailty and CHF. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for mortality from all causes and cardiovascular disease (CVD).A total of 16,175 participants with cardiac and cerebrovascular disease were categorized into CHF (n= 1,125) and non-CHF (n= 15,050) groups. In patients with CHF, the prevalence of frailty, pre-frailty, and non-frailty were 66.31, 30.93, and 2.75%, respectively. In multiple logistic regression, patients with CHF who were male (OR = 0.63, 95% CI: 3.11-5.22), whose annual family income was over $20,000 (OR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.37-0.72,p< 0.001), or with normal hemoglobin level (OR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.68-0.88,P< 0.001) had a lower likelihood of frailty.

In this case-control study, we evaluated the expression of genes involved in epigenetic machinery (DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B, HDAC2, and HDAC3) and the degree of methylation of promoters of immune response genes (IFITM1/2/3, TLR3/4, TNF-α, NF-κB, and MYD88) as well as global methylation (LINE-1 and global 5-mC) in blood samples from 120 COVID-19 patients (30 mild, 30 moderate, 30 severe, and 30 critical) and 30 healthy subjects without COVID-19. In contrast to previous reports, DNMT3A and DNMT3B expression was found to be significantly downregulated in COVID-19 cases, whereas DNMT1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 expression did not change. DNMT1 and DNMT3A were negatively correlated with COVID-19 severity. Critically ill patients had lower HDAC3 expression levels. TLR4 and TNF-α had increased promoter methylation, whereas IFITM1/2/3, TLR3, NF-κB, MYD88, and LINE-1 did not differ between cases and controls. Methylation of the TNF-α promoter increased as disease severity increased. Significantly less methylation of the TLR3 promoter was observed in patients with a positive outcome (recovery). We also found a correlation between the expression of DNMT3B and the methylation level of the TLR4 promoter. In milder cases, the global 5-mC levels were lower than that in more severe cases.

In addition, there is also evidence that higher coffee consumption is associated with lower rates of colon and rectal cancer, as well as breast, endometrial, and other cancers, although for some of these cancers, the results are conflicting. These studies reflect the chemopreventive effects of coffee; there is also evidence that coffee consumption may be therapeutic for some forms of breast and colon cancer, and this needs to be further investigated. The mechanisms associated with the chemopreventive or chemotherapeutic effects of over 1000 individual compounds in roasted coffee are complex and may vary with different diseases. Some of these mechanisms may be related to nuclear factor erythroid 2 (Nrf2)-regulated pathways that target oxidative stress or pathways that induce reactive oxygen species to kill diseased cells (primarily therapeutic). There is evidence for the involvement of receptors which include the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and orphan nuclear receptor 4A1 (NR4A1), as well as contributions from epigenetic pathways and the gut microbiome. Further elucidation of the mechanisms will facilitate the potential future clinical applications of coffee extracts for treating cancer and other inflammatory diseases."

In this article, an ensemble of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms is evaluated in terms of predicting the severity of their condition using plasma proteomics and clinical data as input. An overview of AI-based technical developments to support COVID-19 patient management is presented outlining the landscape of relevant technical developments. Based on this review, the use of an ensemble of ML algorithms that analyze clinical and biological data (i.e., plasma proteomics) of COVID-19 patients is designed and deployed to evaluate the potential use of AI for early COVID-19 patient triage. The proposed pipeline is evaluated using three publicly available datasets for training and testing. Three ML ""tasks"" are defined, and several algorithms are tested through a hyperparameter tuning method to identify the highest-performance models. As overfitting is one of the typical pitfalls for such approaches (mainly due to the size of the training/validation datasets), a variety of evaluation metrics are used to mitigate this risk. In the evaluation procedure, recall scores ranged from 0.6 to 0.74 and F1-score from 0.62 to 0.75. The best performance is observed via Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithms. Additionally, input data (proteomics and clinical data) were ranked based on corresponding Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) values and evaluated for their prognosticated capacity and immuno-biological credence. This ""interpretable"" approach revealed that our ML models could discern critical COVID-19 cases predominantly based on patient's age and plasma proteins on B cell dysfunction, hyper-activation of inflammatory pathways like Toll-like receptors, and hypo-activation of developmental and immune pathways like SCF/c-Kit signaling. Finally, the herein computational workflow is corroborated in an independent dataset and MLP superiority along with the implication of the abovementioned predictive biological pathways are corroborated. Regarding limitations of the presented ML pipeline, the datasets used in this study contain less than 1000 observations and a significant number of input features hence constituting a high-dimensional low-sample (HDLS) dataset which could be sensitive to overfitting. An advantage of the proposed pipeline is that it combines biological data (plasma proteomics) with clinical-phenotypic data. Thus, in principle, the presented approach could enable patient triage in a timely fashion if used on already trained models. However, larger datasets and further systematic validation are needed to confirm the potential clinical value of this approach.

As dysregulated inflammation and coagulation responses have been implicated in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and sepsis, we studied their plasma proteome profiles to delineate similarities from specific features.We measured 276 plasma proteins involved in Inflammation, organ damage, immune response and coagulation in healthy controls, COVID-19 patients during acute and convalescence phase, and sepsis patients; the latter included (i) community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) caused by Influenza, (ii) bacterial CAP, (iii) non-pneumonia sepsis, and (iv) septic shock patients.We identified a core response to infection consisting of 42 proteins altered in both COVID-19 and sepsis, although higher levels of cytokine storm-associated proteins were evident in sepsis. Furthermore, microbiologic etiology and clinical endotypes were linked to unique signatures. Finally, through machine learning, we identified biomarkers, such as TRIM21, PTN and CASP8, that accurately differentiated COVID-19 from CAP-sepsis with higher accuracy than standard clinical markers.This study extends the understanding of host responses underlying sepsis and COVID-19, indicating varying disease mechanisms with unique signatures. These diagnostic and severity signatures are candidates for the development of personalized management of COVID-19 and sepsis.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36827376","Microscale combinatorial stimulation of human myeloid cells reveals inflammatory priming by viral ligands.","Sci Adv","Cells sense a wide variety of signals and respond by adopting complex transcriptional states. Most single-cell profiling is carried out today at cellular baseline, blind to cells' potential spectrum of functional responses. Exploring the space of cellular responses experimentally requires access to a large combinatorial perturbation space. Single-cell genomics coupled with multiplexing techniques provide a useful tool for characterizing cell states across several experimental conditions. However, current multiplexing strategies require programmatic handling of many samples in macroscale arrayed formats, precluding their application in large-scale combinatorial analysis. Here, we introduce StimDrop, a method that combines antibody-based cell barcoding with parallel droplet processing to automatically formulate cell population × stimulus combinations in a microfluidic device. We applied StimDrop to profile the effects of 512 sequential stimulation conditions on human dendritic cells. Our results demonstrate that priming with viral ligands potentiates hyperinflammatory responses to a second stimulus, and show transcriptional signatures consistent with this phenomenon in myeloid cells of patients with severe COVID-19."

Global correlation analysis of the plasma factorsrevealed two core inflammatory modules, core I and II, comprising mainly myeloid cell and lymphoid cell compartments, respectively, with enhanced impact in a severity-dependent manner. We observed elevated IFNA1 and suppressed IL12p40, presenting a robust inverse correlation in severe patients, which was strongly associated with persistent hyperinflammation in 8.3% of moderate pneumonia patients and 59.4% of severe patients.Aberrant persistence of pulmonary and systemic inflammation might be associated with long COVID-19 sequelae.

Here we identify the innate immune kinase TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1)3as a candidate immune-evasion gene in a pooled genetic screen4. Using a suite of genetic and pharmacological tools across multiple experimental model systems, we confirm a role for TBK1 as an immune-evasion gene. Targeting TBK1 enhances responses to PD-1 blockade by decreasing the cytotoxicity threshold to effector cytokines (TNF and IFNγ). TBK1 inhibition in combination with PD-1 blockade also demonstrated efficacy using patient-derived tumour models, with concordant findings in matched patient-derived organotypic tumour spheroids and matched patient-derived organoids. Tumour cells lacking TBK1 are primed to undergo RIPK- and caspase-dependent cell death in response to TNF and IFNγ in a JAK-STAT-dependent manner. Taken together, our results demonstrate that targeting TBK1 is an effective strategy to overcome resistance to cancer immunotherapy.© 2023.

In a nutshell, etiology of the common autoimmune disorders is unknown in spite of progress elucidating certain effector cells and molecules responsible for pathologies associated with inflammatory and tissue damage. In recent years, population genetics approaches have greatly enriched our knowledge regarding genetic susceptibility of autoimmunity, providing us with a window of opportunities to comprehensively re-examine autoimmunity-associated genes and possible pathways. In this review, we aim to discuss etiology and pathogenesis of common autoimmune disorders from the perspective of human genetics. An overview of the genetic basis of autoimmunity is followed by 3 chapters detailing susceptibility genes involved in innate immunity, adaptive immunity and inflammatory cell death processes respectively. With such attempts, we hope to expand the scope of thinking and bring attention to lesser appreciated molecules and pathways as important contributors of autoimmunity beyond the 'usual suspects' of a limited subset of validated therapeutic targets.© 2023.

"36685668","Characterisation of APS-1 Experimental Models Is Crucial for Development of Novel Therapies.","Biomed Res Int","Autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 1 (APS-1) is an inherited autosomal disorder. The most common clinical features of the disease include adrenocortical failure, hypoparathyroidism (HP), and chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC). APS-1 is caused by mutations in the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene. AIRE is a transcriptional factor involved in the regulation of thousands of genes in the thymus. It facilitates central tolerance by promoting the ectopic expression of tissue-specific antigens (TSAs) in medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs), leading to the deletion of self-reactive thymocytes. Several Aire-deficient mice were developed separately, on different backgrounds; seven published Aire knockout mice show a variety of phenotypes depending on the strain used to generate the experimental model. The first Aire-deficient mice were generated on a ""black 6"" background almost 20 years ago. The model showed mild phenotype with relatively modest penetrance compared to models generated on BALBc or NOD backgrounds. The generation of all these experimental models is crucial for development and testing new therapeutics as well as reading the response to treatments.Copyright © 2023 Sarah Almaghrabi et al."

Organoid models for a wide range of tissues are emerging as an additional tool enabling the study of diabetes mellitus. The applications for organoid models include studying human pancreatic cell development, pancreatic physiology, the response of target organs to pancreatic hormones and how glucose toxicity can affect tissues such as the blood vessels, retina, kidney and nerves. Organoids can be derived from human tissue cells or pluripotent stem cells and enable the production of human cell assemblies mimicking human organs. Many organ mimics relevant to diabetes mellitus are already available, but only a few relevant studies have been performed. We discuss the models that have been developed for the pancreas, liver, kidney, nerves and vasculature, how they complement other models, and their limitations.

To test this idea in a reductionist setting, in which genes and environment are controlled, we investigated differences in neuroanatomy and structural covariance by ex vivo structural magnetic resonance imaging in mice whose behavioral activity was continuously tracked for 3 months in a large, enriched environment. We confirmed that environmental enrichment increases mouse hippocampal volumes. Stratifying the enriched group according to individual longitudinal behavioral trajectories, however, revealed striking differences in mouse brain structural covariance in continuously highly active mice compared to those whose trajectories showed signs of habituating activity. Network-based statistics identified distinct subnetworks of murine structural covariance underlying these differences in behavioral activity. Together, these results reveal that differentiated behavioral trajectories of mice in an enriched environment are associated with differences in brain connectivity.© 2023, Bogado Lopes et al."

DNA methylation was profiled on Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC arrays, mRNA by RNA-sequencing, and miRNAs by small RNA-sequencing. Linear models were fit to test for effect of diagnosis and phenotype, adjusting for age, sex, and smoking. We built a supervised multi-omics model using a subset of features from each dataset.We identified 46,812 CpGs, 1,842 mRNAs, and 5 miRNAs associated with sarcoidosis versus controls and 1 mRNA,SEPP1- a protein that supplies selenium to cells, associated with disease progression. Our integrated model emphasized the prominence of the PI3K/AKT1 pathway in sarcoidosis, which is important in T cell and mTOR function. Novel immune related genes and miRNAs includingLYST, RGS14, SLFN12L, and hsa-miR-199b-5p, distinguished sarcoidosis from controls. Our integrated model also demonstrated differential expression/methylation ofIL20RB, ABCC11, SFSWAP, AGBL4, miR-146a-3p, and miR-378b between non-progressive and progressive sarcoidosis.Leveraging the DNA methylome, transcriptome, and miRNA-sequencing in sarcoidosis BAL cells, we detected widespread molecular changes associated with disease, many which are involved in immune response.

With respect to network inference, scMINER does not rely on the binding motifs which are available for a limited set of transcription factors, therefore scMINER can provide quantitative activity assessment for more than 6,000 transcription and signaling drivers from a scRNA-seq experiment. As demonstrations, we used scMINER to expose hidden transcription and signaling drivers and dissect their regulon rewiring in immune cell heterogeneity, lineage differentiation, and tissue specification.

ANKLE1 is molecularly characterized as an endonuclease that efficiently cuts branched DNA and shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm. However, the role of ANKLE1 in mammalian development and homeostasis remains unknown. In normal development ANKLE1 expression is limited to the erythroblast lineage and we found that ANKLE1's role is to cleave the mitochondrial genome during erythropoiesis. We show that ectopic expression of ANKLE1 in breast epithelial-derived cells leads to genome instability and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cleavage. mtDNA degradation then leads to mitophagy and causes a shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis (Warburg effect). Moreover, mtDNA degradation activates STAT1 and expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) genes. Reduction in mitochondrial content contributes to apoptosis resistance, which may allow precancerous cells to avoid apoptotic checkpoints and proliferate. These findings provide evidence that ANKLE1 is the causal cancer susceptibility gene in the chr19p13.1 locus and describe mechanisms by which higher ANKLE1 expression promotes cancer risk.© 2023.

However, machine learning (ML)-based models that address this issue are lacking.Transcriptomic profiles based on DNA microarray data were extracted from the GSE32591 and GSE112943 datasets. Comprehensive bioinformatics analyses were performed to identify disease-defining genes (DDGs). Peripheral blood samples (GSE81622, GSE99967, and GSE72326) were used to evaluate the effect of DDGs. Single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) scores of the DDGs were calculated and correlated with specific immunology genes listed in the nCounter panel. GSE60681 and GSE69438 were used to examine the ability of the DDGs to discriminate LN from other renal diseases. K-means clustering was used to obtain the separate gene sets. The clustering results were extended to data derived using the nCounter technique. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm was used to identify genes with high predictive value for treatment response after the first RF in each cluster. LASSO models with tenfold validation were built in GSE200306 and assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis with area under curve (AUC). The models were validated by using an independent dataset (GSE113342).Forty-five hub genes specific to LN were identified. Eight optimal disease-defining clusters (DDCs) were identified in this study. Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation pathway was significantly enriched in DDC-6. LCK in DDC-6, whose expression positively correlated with various subsets of T cell infiltrations, was found to be differentially expressed between responders and non-responders and was ranked high in regulatory network analysis. Based on DDC-6, the prediction model had the best performance (AUC: 0.75; 95% confidence interval: 0.44-1 in the testing set) and high precision (0.83), recall (0.71), and F1 score (0.77) in the validation dataset.Our study demonstrates that incorporating knowledge of biological phenotypes into the ML model is feasible for evaluating treatment response after the first RF in LN. This knowledge-based incorporation improves the model's transparency and performance. In addition, LCK may serve as a biomarker for T-cell infiltration and a therapeutic target in LN.© 2023.

In this paper, the potential mechanisms of 35 ferroptosis-related genes in U87 glial cells exposed to fluoride were explored by bioinformatics methods. Significantly, these genes are involved in oxidative stress, ferroptosis, and decanoate CoA ligase activity. Ten pivotal genes were found by the Maximal Clique Centrality (MCC) algorithm. Furthermore, according to the Connectivity Map (CMap) and the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD), 10 possible drugs for fluorosis were predicted and screened, and a drug target ferroptosis-related gene network was constructed. Molecular docking was used to study the interaction between small molecule compounds and target proteins. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation results show that the structure of the Celestrol-HMOX1 composite is stable and the docking effect is the best.

However, early pathogenic events that lead to disease and the degree to which they are common acrossMAPTmutations remain poorly understood. The goal of this study is to determine whether there is a common molecular signature of FTLD-Tau.Methods:We analyzed genes differentially expressed in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons (iPSC-neurons) that represent the three major categories ofMAPTmutations: splicing (IVS10 + 16), exon 10 (p.P301L), and C-terminal (p.R406W) compared with isogenic controls. The genes that were commonly differentially expressed inMAPTIVS10 + 16, p.P301L, and p.R406W neurons were enriched in trans-synaptic signaling, neuronal processes, and lysosomal function. Many of these pathways are sensitive to disruptions in calcium homeostasis. One gene,CALB1, was significantly reduced across the threeMAPTmutant iPSC-neurons and in a mouse model of tau accumulation. We observed a significant reduction in calcium levels inMAPTmutant neurons compared with isogenic controls, pointing to a functional consequence of this disrupted gene expression. Finally, a subset of genes commonly differentially expressed acrossMAPTmutations were also dysregulated in brains fromMAPTmutation carriers and to a lesser extent in brains from sporadic Alzheimer disease and progressive supranuclear palsy, suggesting that molecular signatures relevant to genetic and sporadic forms of tauopathy are captured in a dish. The results from this study demonstrate that iPSC-neurons capture molecular processes that occur in human brains and can be used to pinpoint common molecular pathways involving synaptic and lysosomal function and neuronal development, which may be regulated by disruptions in calcium homeostasis.Copyright © 2023 Minaya, Mahali, Iyer, Eteleeb, Martinez, Huang, Budde, Temple, Nana, Seeley, Spina, Grinberg, Harari and Karch."

A visual saliency map of brain regions showed that lower volumes in the fornix and the lower part of the thalamus are key predictors of high delta age. Genome-wide association analysis of the delta age using the SNP array data identified associated variants in gene regions such as KLF3-AS1 and STX1. GWAS was also performed on the volumes in the fornix and the lower part of the thalamus, showing a high genetic correlation with delta age, indicating that they share a genetic basis. Mendelian randomization (MR) for all metabolomic biomarkers and blood-related phenotypes showed that immune-related phenotypes have a causal impact on increasing delta age.

Furthermore, although SVE stabilized behavioral rhythms in these animals, the SCN transcriptome remained dysregulated. The molecular programs in the lung and liver ofVipr2-/-mice were partially intact, although their response to SVE differed to that of these peripheral tissues in theVipr2+/+mice.

Here we identify electrophilic small molecules that rapidly and stereoselectively decrease the expression of transcripts encoding the androgen receptor and its splice variants in prostate cancer cells. We show by chemical proteomics that the compounds engage C145 of the RNA-binding protein NONO. Broader profiling revealed that covalent NONO ligands suppress an array of cancer-relevant genes and impair cancer cell proliferation. Surprisingly, these effects were not observed in cells genetically disrupted for NONO, which were instead resistant to NONO ligands. Reintroduction of wild-type NONO, but not a C145S mutant, restored ligand sensitivity in NONO-disrupted cells. The ligands promoted NONO accumulation in nuclear foci and stabilized NONO-RNA interactions, supporting a trapping mechanism that may prevent compensatory action of paralog proteins PSPC1 and SFPQ.

Median age for 21 patients with somatic-only PVs in 11 other HR-related genes ranged from 40 to 67 years. In older patients, 7% (n = 22) had somatic BRCA1/2 PVs, and 1% (n = 2) had PVs other HR-related genes; this rate was not significantly different to younger patients (<70 years), 7% (n = 62) BRCA1/2 and 2% (n = 19) other HR-related genes (p = 0.36).

We show how such observations can be interpreted in light of a model of mutation-selection balance and use the model to relate the pathogenic consequences of LOF mutations at present to their evolutionary fitness effects. To this end, we first infer posterior distributions for the fitness costs of LOF mutations in 17,318 autosomal and 679 X-linked genes from exome sequences in 56,855 individuals. Estimated fitness costs for the loss of a gene copy are typically above 1%; they tend to be largest for X-linked genes, whether or not they have a Y homolog, followed by autosomal genes and genes in the pseudoautosomal region. We compare inferred fitness effects for all possible de novo LOF mutations to those of de novo mutations identified in individuals diagnosed with one of six severe, complex diseases or developmental disorders. Probands carry an excess of mutations with estimated fitness effects above 10%; as we show by simulation, when sampled in the population, such highly deleterious mutations are typically only a couple of generations old. Moreover, the proportion of highly deleterious mutations carried by probands reflects the typical age of onset of the disease. The study design also has a discernible influence: a greater proportion of highly deleterious mutations is detected in pedigree than case-control studies, and for autism, in simplex than multiplex families and in female versus male probands. Thus, anchoring observations in human genetics to a population genetic model allows us to learn about the fitness effects of mutations identified by different mapping strategies and for different traits.© 2023, Agarwal, Fuller et al."

To demonstrate the usability of the tool, we designed a case study for multiple sclerosis that revealed IKZF1 as a promising hub regulator, which was supported by independent ChIP-seq data.MODalyseR is available as a Docker image at https://hub.docker.com/r/ddeweerd/modalyser with user guide and installation instructions found at https://gustafsson-lab.gitlab.io/MODalyseR/.Supplementary data are available atBioinformatics Advancesonline.© The Author(s) 2022.

"36826024","Expressions of Type I and III Interferons, Endogenous Retroviruses, TRIM28, and SETDB1 in Children with Respiratory Syncytial Virus Bronchiolitis.","Curr Issues Mol Biol","Interferons (IFNs) and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) play essential roles for the control of viral infections. Their expression in infants with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis is poorly defined. Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) represent 8% of our genome and modulate inflammatory and immune reactions. TRIM28 and SETDB1 participate in the epigenetic regulation of genes involved in the immune response, including IFNs and HERVs. No study has explored the expression of HERVs, TRIM28, and SETDB1 during RSV bronchiolitis. We assessed, through a PCR real-time Taqman amplification assay, the transcription levels of six IFN-I ISGs, four IFNλs, the pol genes of HERV-H, -K, and -W families, the env genes of Syncytin (SYN)1 and SYN2, and of TRIM28/SETDB1 in whole blood from 37 children hospitalized for severe RSV bronchiolitis and in healthy children (HC). The expression of most IFN-I ISGs was significantly higher in RSV+ patients than in age-matched HC, but it was inhibited by steroid therapy. The mRNA concentrations of IFN-λs were comparable between patients and age-matched HC. This lack of RSV-driven IFN-III activation may result in the defective protection of the airway mucosal surface leading to severe bronchiolitis. The expression of IFN-III showed a positive correlation with age in HC, that could account for the high susceptibility of young children to viral respiratory tract infections. The transcription levels of every HERV gene were significantly lower in RSV+ patients than in HC, while the expressions of TRIM28/SETDB1 were overlapping. Given the negative impact of HERVs and the positive effects of TRIM28/SETDB1 on innate and adaptive immune responses, the downregulation of the former and the normal expression of the latter may contribute to preserving immune functions against infection."
"36640769","Origins of DNA replication in eukaryotes.","Mol Cell","Errors occurring during DNA replication can result in inaccurate replication, incomplete replication, or re-replication, resulting in genome instability that can lead to diseases such as cancer or disorders such as autism. A great deal of progress has been made toward understanding the entire process of DNA replication in eukaryotes, including the mechanism of initiation and its control. This review focuses on the current understanding of how the origin recognition complex (ORC) contributes to determining the location of replication initiation in the multiple chromosomes within eukaryotic cells, as well as methods for mapping the location and temporal patterning of DNA replication. Origin specification and configuration vary substantially between eukaryotic species and in some cases co-evolved with gene-silencing mechanisms. We discuss the possibility that centromeres and origins of DNA replication were originally derived from a common element and later separated during evolution.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

"36690068","Phase Separation in Biology and Disease; Current Perspectives and Open Questions.","J Mol Biol","In the past almost 15 years, we witnessed the birth of a new scientific field focused on the existence, formation, biological functions, and disease associations of membraneless bodies in cells, now referred to as biomolecular condensates. Pioneering studies from several laboratories [reviewed in1-3] supported a model wherein biomolecular condensates associated with diverse biological processes form through the process of phase separation. These and other findings that followed have revolutionized our understanding of how biomolecules are organized in space and time within cells to perform myriad biological functions, including cell fate determination, signal transduction, endocytosis, regulation of gene expression and protein translation, and regulation of RNA metabolism. Further, condensates formed through aberrant phase transitions have been associated with numerous human diseases, prominently including neurodegeneration and cancer. While in some cases, rigorous evidence supports links between formation of biomolecular condensates through phase separation and biological functions, in many others such links are less robustly supported, which has led to rightful scrutiny of the generality of the roles of phase separation in biology and disease.4-7During a week-long workshop in March 2022 at the Telluride Science Research Center (TSRC) in Telluride, Colorado, ∼25 scientists addressed key questions surrounding the biomolecular condensates field. Herein, we present insights gained through these discussions, addressing topics including, roles of condensates in diverse biological processes and systems, and normal and disease cell states, their applications to synthetic biology, and the potential for therapeutically targeting biomolecular condensates.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

"36834894","Exploration of the Core Pathways and Potential Targets of Luteolin Treatment on Late-Onset Depression Based on Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteomics.","Int J Mol Sci","Cognitive deficiency is one of the fundamental characteristics of late-onset depression (LOD). Luteolin (LUT) possesses antidepressant, anti-aging, and neuroprotective properties, which can dramatically enhance cognition. The altered composition of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is involved in neuronal plasticity and neurogenesis, directly reflects the physio-pathological status of the central nervous system. It is not well known whether the effect of LUT on LOD is in association with a changed CSF composition. Therefore, this study first established a rat model of LOD and then tested the therapeutic effects of LUT using several behavioral approaches. A gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to evaluate the CSF proteomics data for KEGG pathway enrichment and Gene Ontology annotation. We combined network pharmacology and differentially expressed proteins to screen for key GSEA-KEGG pathways as well as potential targets for LUT therapy for LOD. Molecular docking was adopted to verify the affinity and binding activity of LUT to these potential targets. The outcomes demonstrated that LUT improved the cognitive and depression-like behaviors in LOD rats. LUT may exert therapeutic effects on LOD through the axon guidance pathway. Five axon guidance molecules-EFNA5,EPHB4,EPHA4,SEMA7A, andNTNG-as well asUNC5B,L1CAM, andDCC, may be candidates for the LUT treatment of LOD."

Despite the advancements in untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to achieve a high-throughput profile of metabolites from complex biological resources, only a small fraction of these metabolites can be annotated with confidence. Many novel computational methods and tools have been developed to enable chemical structure annotation to known and unknown compounds such as in silico generated spectra and molecular networking. Here, we present an automated and reproducible Metabolome Annotation Workflow (MAW) for untargeted metabolomics data to further facilitate and automate the complex annotation by combining tandem mass spectrometry (MS2) input data pre-processing, spectral and compound database matching with computational classification, and in silico annotation. MAW takes the LC-MS2spectra as input and generates a list of putative candidates from spectral and compound databases. The databases are integrated via the R package Spectra and the metabolite annotation tool SIRIUS as part of the R segment of the workflow (MAW-R). The final candidate selection is performed using the cheminformatics tool RDKit in the Python segment (MAW-Py). Furthermore, each feature is assigned a chemical structure and can be imported to a chemical structure similarity network. MAW is following the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles and has been made available as the docker images, maw-r and maw-py. The source code and documentation are available on GitHub ( https://github.com/zmahnoor14/MAW ). The performance of MAW is evaluated on two case studies. MAW can improve candidate ranking by integrating spectral databases with annotation tools like SIRIUS which contributes to an efficient candidate selection procedure. The results from MAW are also reproducible and traceable, compliant with the FAIR guidelines. Taken together, MAW could greatly facilitate automated metabolite characterization in diverse fields such as clinical metabolomics and natural product discovery.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Sharing these workflows provides researchers easy access to high-quality analysis methods without the requirement of computational expertise. However, published workflows are not always guaranteed to be reliably reusable. Therefore, a system is needed to lower the cost of sharing workflows in a reusable form.We introduce Yevis, a system to build a workflow registry that automatically validates and tests workflows to be published. The validation and test are based on the requirements we defined for a workflow being reusable with confidence. Yevis runs on GitHub and Zenodo and allows workflow hosting without the need of dedicated computing resources. A Yevis registry accepts workflow registration via a GitHub pull request, followed by an automatic validation and test process for the submitted workflow. As a proof of concept, we built a registry using Yevis to host workflows from a community to demonstrate how a workflow can be shared while fulfilling the defined requirements.Yevis helps in the building of a workflow registry to share reusable workflows without requiring extensive human resources. By following Yevis's workflow-sharing procedure, one can operate a registry while satisfying the reusable workflow criteria.

However, assemblies from some third generation long read technologies, such as Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) continuous long reads (CLR), have a high error rate. Such errors can be corrected with short reads through a process called polishing. Although best practices for polishing non-model de novo genome assemblies were recently described by the Vertebrate Genome Project (VGP) Assembly community, there is a need for a publicly available, reproducible workflow that can be easily implemented and run on a conventional high performance computing environment. Here, we describe polishCLR (https://github.com/isugifNF/polishCLR), a reproducible Nextflow workflow that implements best practices for polishing assemblies made from CLR data. PolishCLR can be initiated from several input options that extend best practices to suboptimal cases. It also provides re-entry points throughout several key processes, including identifying duplicate haplotypes in purge_dups, allowing a break for scaffolding if data are available, and throughout multiple rounds of polishing and evaluation with Arrow and FreeBayes.

This basic task may be tricky when the definition of the adapter sequence is not well documented.We have developed a new method to scan a set of ONT reads to see if it contains adapters, without any prior knowledge on the sequence of the potential adapters, and then trim out those adapters.

We performed gene-based burden tests to assess the association between rare variants and BMD, and identified several BMD candidate genes.BMD is highly heritable and a major predictor of osteoporotic fractures, but its genetic basis remains unclear. We aimed to identify rare risk variants contributing to BMD.Utilizing the newly released UK Biobank 200,643 exome dataset, we conducted a gene-based exome-wide association study in males and females, respectively. First, 100,639 males and 117,338 females with BMD values were included in the polygenic risk scores (PRS) analysis. Among individuals with lower 30% PRS, cases were individuals with top 10% BMD, and individuals with bottom 10% BMD were the controls. Considering the effects of vitamin D (VD), individuals with the highest 30% VD concentration were selected for VD-BMD analysis. After quality control, 741 males and 697 females were included in the BMD analysis, and 717 males and 708 females were included in the VD-BMD analysis. The variants were annotated by ANNOVAR software, then BMD and VD-BMD qualified variants were imported into the SKAT R-package to perform gene-based burden tests, respectively.The gene-based burden test of the exonic variants identified genome-wide candidate associations in ANKRD18A (P = 1.60 × 10-5, PBonferroni adjust= 2.11 × 10-3), C22orf31 (P = 3.49 × 10-4, PBonferroni adjust= 3.17 × 10-2), and SPATC1L (P = 1.09 × 10-5, PBonferroni adjust= 8.80 × 10-3). For VD-BMD analysis, three genes were associated with BMD, such as NIPAL1 (P = 1.06 × 10-3, PBonferroni adjust= 3.91 × 10-2).Our study suggested that rare variants contribute to BMD, providing new sights for broadening the genetic structure of BMD.© 2023.

Prostanoids are the target of several drugs, but it has been shown that some of them increase the risk of thrombosis. Overall, many studies have shown that prostanoids are tightly associated with cardiovascular diseases and that several polymorphisms in genes involved in their synthesis and function increase the risk of developing these pathologies.

We used single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in and near the IL-6 receptor(IL6R)gene, focusing on the non-synonymous variant, rs2228145, associated with reduced classical IL-6 signalling, to assess the effect of altered IL-6 activity on TB disease risk. We identified 16 genome wide association studies (GWAS) of TB disease collating 17,982 cases of TB disease and 972,389 controls across 4 continents. Meta-analyses and Mendelian randomisation analyses revealed that reduced classical IL-6 signalling was associated with lower odds of TB disease, a finding replicated using multiple, independent SNP instruments and 2 separate exposure variables. Our findings establish a causal relationship between IL-6 signalling and the outcome ofMtbinfection, suggesting IL-6 antagonists do not increase the risk of TB disease and should be investigated as adjuncts in treatment."

Animal models on a single genetic background have so far failed to recapitulate the clinical presentation of human nephropathies. Here, we used a simple model of folic acid-induced kidney injury in 7 highly diverse mouse strains. We measured plasma and urine parameters, as well as renal histopathology and mRNA expression data, at 1, 2, and 6 weeks after injury, covering the early recovery and long-term remission. We observed an extensive strain-specific response ranging from complete resistance of the CAST/EiJ to high sensitivity of the C57BL/6J, DBA/2J, and PWK/PhJ strains. In susceptible strains, the severe early kidney injury was accompanied by the induction of mitochondrial stress response (MSR) genes and the attenuation of NAD+ synthesis pathways. This is associated with delayed healing and a prolonged inflammatory and adaptive immune response 6 weeks after insult, heralding a transition to chronic kidney disease. Through a thorough comparison of the transcriptomic response in mouse and human disease, we show that critical metabolic gene alterations were shared across species, and we highlight the PWK/PhJ strain as an emergent model of transition from acute kidney injury to chronic disease."

However, its clinical applicability to predict disease/trait outcomes remains unclear as statistical models are not designed to make predictions. This study employs statistics-free machine-learning (ML)-optimized polygenic risk score (PRS) to complement existing GWAS and bring the prediction of disease/trait outcomes closer to clinical application. Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) was selected as a model disease to demonstrate the robustness of ML in disease prediction as RA is a prevalent chronic inflammatory joint disease with high mortality rates, affecting adults at the economic prime. Early identification of at-risk individuals may facilitate measures to mitigate the effects of the disease.This study employs a robust ML feature selection algorithm to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that can predict RA from a set of training data comprising RA patients and population control samples. Thereafter, selected SNPs were evaluated for their predictive performances across 3 independent, unseen test datasets. The selected SNPs were subsequently used to generate PRS which was also evaluated for its predictive capacity as a sole feature.Through robust ML feature selection, 9 SNPs were found to be the minimum number of features for excellent predictive performance (AUC > 0.9) in 3 independent, unseen test datasets. PRS based on these 9 SNPs was significantly associated with (P < 1 × 10-16) and predictive (AUC > 0.9) of RA in the 3 unseen datasets. A RA ML-PRS calculator of these 9 SNPs was developed ( https://xistance.shinyapps.io/prs-ra/ ) to facilitate individualized clinical applicability. The majority of the predictive SNPs are protective, reside in non-coding regions, and are either predicted to be potentially functional SNPs (pfSNPs) or in high linkage disequilibrium (r2 > 0.8) with un-interrogated pfSNPs.These findings highlight the promise of this ML strategy to identify useful genetic features that can robustly predict disease and amenable to translation for clinical application.© 2023.

"36712323","Sex differences in interindividual gene expression variability across human tissues.","PNAS Nexus","Understanding phenotypic sex differences has long been a goal of biology from both a medical and evolutionary perspective. Although much attention has been paid to mean differences in phenotype between the sexes, little is known about sex differences in phenotypic variability. To gain insight into sex differences in interindividual variability at the molecular level, we analyzed RNA-seq data from 43 tissues from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx). Within each tissue, we identified genes that show sex differences in gene expression variability. We found that these sex-differentially variable (SDV) genes are associated with various important biological functions, including sex hormone response, immune response, and other signaling pathways. By analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing data collected from breast epithelial cells, we found that genes with sex differences in gene expression variability in breast tissue tend to be expressed in a cell-type-specific manner. We looked for an association between SDV expression and Graves' disease, a well-known heavily female-biased disease, and found a significant enrichment of Graves' associated genes among genes with higher variability in females in thyroid tissue. This suggests a possible role for SDV expression in sex-biased disease. We then examined the evolutionary constraints acting on genes with sex differences in variability and found that they exhibit evidence of increased selective constraint. Through analysis of sex-biased eQTL data, we found evidence that SDV expression may have a genetic basis. Finally, we propose a simple evolutionary model for the emergence of SDV expression from sex-specific constraints.© The Author(s) 2022.

MATERIAL AND METHODS In total, we successfully recruited 3162 participants, including 1026 participants with high myopia and cataracts and 2136 controls with high myopia only. For genotyping, 22 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TRIB2 and CAPRIN2 genes were chosen. Single marker association analysis and functional effects of significant SNPs were carried out. RESULTS Strong correlation signals were captured for SNP rs890069 (χ²=22.13, P=2.55×10-6) in TRIB2 and SNP rs17739338 (χ²=16.07, P=6.10×10-5) in CAPRIN2. In patients with high myopia, the C allele at SNP rs890069 was strongly linked to cataract risk (OR [95% CI]=1.36 [1.20-1.55]). In patients with high myopia, the T allele at SNP rs17739338 was significantly related to a lower risk of cataract (OR [95% CI]=0.54 [0.40-0.74]). In different types of human tissues, SNPs rs890069 and rs17739338 were found to be significantly correlated to the levels of TRIB2 and CAPRIN2 gene expression. CONCLUSIONS Our study indicated that both TRIB2 and CAPRIN2 genes conferred the susceptibility to cataract in patients with high myopia and Chinese Han ancestry. Future research remains necessary for fully understanding the pathogenic mechanisms and genetic characteristics of cataract."

This study aimed to explore genes underlying the pathogenesis of IgAN.We conducted the summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) analysis and performed functional mapping and annotation using FUMA to explore genetic loci that are potentially involved in the pathogenies of IgAN. Both analyses used summarized data of a recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) on IgANs, which included 477,784 Europeans (15,587 cases and 462,197 controls) and 175,359 East Asians (71 cases and 175,288 controls). We performed SMR analysis using Consortium for the Architecture of Gene Expression (CAGE) expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data and replicated the analysis using Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) eQTL data.Using the CAGE eQTL data, our SMR analysis identified 32 probes tagging 25 unique genes whose expression were pleiotropically associated with IgAN, with the top three probes being ILMN_2150787 (tagging HLA-C, PSMR= 2.10 × 10-18), ILMN_1682717 (tagging IER3, PSMR= 1.07 × 10-16) and ILMN_1661439 (tagging FLOT1, PSMR=1.16 × 10-14). Using GTEx eQTL data, our SMR analysis identified 24 probes tagging 24 unique genes whose expressions were pleiotropically associated with IgAN, with the top three probes being ENSG00000271581.1 (tagging XXbac-BPG248L24.12, PSMR= 1.44 × 10-10), ENSG00000186470.9 (tagging BTN3A2, PSMR= 2.28 × 10-10), and ENSG00000224389.4 (tagging C4B, PSMR= 1.23 × 10 -9). FUMA analysis identified 3 independent, significant and lead SNPs, 2 genomic risk loci and 39 genes that are potentially involved in the pathogenesis of IgAN.We identified many genetic variants/loci that are potentially involved in the pathogenesis of IgAN.

"36835623","MeCP2 Is an Epigenetic Factor That Links DNA Methylation with Brain Metabolism.","Int J Mol Sci","DNA methylation, one of the most well-studied epigenetic modifications, is involved in a wide spectrum of biological processes. Epigenetic mechanisms control cellular morphology and function. Such regulatory mechanisms involve histone modifications, chromatin remodeling, DNA methylation, non-coding regulatory RNA molecules, and RNA modifications. One of the most well-studied epigenetic modifications is DNA methylation that plays key roles in development, health, and disease. Our brain is probably the most complex part of our body, with a high level of DNA methylation. A key protein that binds to different types of methylated DNA in the brain is the methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2). MeCP2 acts in a dose-dependent manner and its abnormally high or low expression level, deregulation, and/or genetic mutations lead to neurodevelopmental disorders and aberrant brain function. Recently, some of MeCP2-associated neurodevelopmental disorders have emerged as neurometabolic disorders, suggesting a role for MeCP2 in brain metabolism. Of note,MECP2loss-of-function mutation in Rett Syndrome is reported to cause impairment of glucose and cholesterol metabolism in human patients and/or mouse models of disease. The purpose of this review is to outline the metabolic abnormalities in MeCP2-associated neurodevelopmental disorders that currently have no available cure. We aim to provide an updated overview into the role of metabolic defects associated with MeCP2-mediated cellular function for consideration of future therapeutic strategies."

Of particular concern is the potential impact on the brain, due to the close proximity of communication devices to the head. The main aim of this study was to examine the effects of long-term exposure to RF on the brains of mice in a real-life scenario simulation compared to a laboratory setting. The animals were exposed continuously for 16 weeks to RF using a household Wi-Fi router and a laboratory device with a frequency of 2.45 GHz, and were compared to a sham-exposed group. Before and after exposure, the mice underwent behavioral tests (open-field test and Y-maze); at the end of the exposure period, the brain was harvested for histopathological analysis and assessment of DNA methylation levels. Long-term exposure of mice to 2.45 GHz RF radiation increased their locomotor activity, yet did not cause significant structural or morphological changes in their brains. Global DNA methylation was lower in exposed mice compared to sham mice. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms behind these effects and to understand the potential effects of RF radiation on brain function."

This study aimed to develop a deep learning model to provide individual assessment of survival in advanced NSCLC patients receiving bevacizumab.All data were retrospectively collected from a cohort of 272 radiological and pathological proven advanced non-squamous NSCLC patients. A novel multi-dimensional deep neural network (DNN) models were trained based on clinicopathological, inflammatory and radiomics features using DeepSurv and N-MTLR algorithm. And concordance index (C-index) and bier score was used to demonstrate the discriminatory and predictive capacity of the model.The integration of clinicopathologic, inflammatory and radiomics features representation was performed using DeepSurv and N-MTLR with the C-index of 0.712 and 0.701 in testing cohort. And Cox proportional hazard (CPH) and random survival forest (RSF) models were also developed after data pre-processing and feature selection with the C-index of 0.665 and 0.679 respectively. DeepSurv prognostic model, indicated with best performance, was used for individual prognosis prediction.

However, the current histological staining workflow requires tedious sample preparation steps, specialized laboratory infrastructure, and trained histotechnologists, making it expensive, time-consuming, and not accessible in resource-limited settings. Deep learning techniques created new opportunities to revolutionize staining methods by digitally generating histological stains using trained neural networks, providing rapid, cost-effective, and accurate alternatives to standard chemical staining methods. These techniques, broadly referred to as virtual staining, were extensively explored by multiple research groups and demonstrated to be successful in generating various types of histological stains from label-free microscopic images of unstained samples; similar approaches were also used for transforming images of an already stained tissue sample into another type of stain, performing virtual stain-to-stain transformations. In this Review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the recent research advances in deep learning-enabled virtual histological staining techniques. The basic concepts and the typical workflow of virtual staining are introduced, followed by a discussion of representative works and their technical innovations. We also share our perspectives on the future of this emerging field, aiming to inspire readers from diverse scientific fields to further expand the scope of deep learning-enabled virtual histological staining techniques and their applications.© 2023.

Accurate cancer-type prediction is essential for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Understanding, diagnosing, and identifying the various types of cancer can be greatly aided by knowledge of the cancer genes. The Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and neural pattern recognition (NPR) approaches are used in this study paper to detect and predict the type of cancer. Different Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) have been proposed by various researchers up to this point. Each model concentrated on a certain set of parameters to simulate the expression of genes. We have developed a novel CNN-NPR architecture that predicts cancer type while accounting for the tissue of origin using high-dimensional gene expression inputs. The 5000-person sample of the 1-D CNN integrated with NPR is trained and tested on the gene profile, mapping with various cancer kinds.

However, it is difficult to comprehensively analyze complex biological systems with only a single analytical technique due to different analytical properties and application limitations. Therefore, many analytical methods have been combined to extend data interpretation, evaluate data credibility, and facilitate data mining to explore important temporal and spatial relationships in biological systems. Image registration is an initial and critical step for multimodal imaging data fusion. However, the image registration of multimodal images is not a simple task. The property difference between each data modality may include spatial resolution, image characteristics, or both. The image registrations between MSI and different imaging techniques are often achieved indirectly through histology. Many methods exist for image registration between MSI data and histological images. However, most of them are manual or semiautomatic and have their prerequisites. Here, we built MSI Registrar (MSIr), a web service for automatic registration between MSI and histology. It can help to reduce subjectivity and processing time efficiently. MSIr provides an interface for manually selecting region of interests from histological images; the user selects regions of interest to extract the corresponding spectrum indices in MSI data. In the performance evaluation, MSIr can quickly map MSI data to histological images and help pinpoint molecular components at specific locations in tissues. Most registrations were adequate and were without excessive shifts. MSIr is freely available at https://msir.cmdm.tw and https://github.com/CMDM-Lab/MSIr."

An interesting and vital issue is how to integrate highly sparse genetic genomics data with a mass of minor effects into a prediction model for improving prediction power. We find that the deep learning method can work well to extract features by transforming highly sparse dichotomous data to lower-dimensional continuous data in a non-linear way. This may provide benefits in risk prediction-associated genotype data. We developed a multi-stage strategy to extract information from highly sparse binary genotype data and applied it for cancer prognosis. Specifically, we first reduced the size of binary biomarkersviaa univariable regression model to a moderate size. Then, a trainable auto-encoder was used to learn compact features from the reduced data. Next, we performed a LASSO problem process to select the optimal combination of extracted features. Lastly, we applied such feature combination to real cancer prognostic models and evaluated the raw predictive effect of the models. The results indicated that these compressed transformation features could better improve the model's original predictive performance and might avoid an overfitting problem.

It has applications in all aspects of life and scientific research, such as disease diagnosis, drug target discovery, pathological research, species protection, and SARS-CoV-2 detection. However, the first- and second-generation sequencing technology relied on fluorescence detection systems and DNA polymerization enzyme systems, which increased the cost of sequencing technology and limited its scope of applications. The third-generation sequencing technology performs PCR-free and single-molecule sequencing, but it still depends on the fluorescence detection device. To break through these limitations, researchers have made arduous efforts to develop a new advanced portable sequencing technology represented by nanopore sequencing. Nanopore technology has the advantages of small size and convenient portability, independent of biochemical reagents, and direct reading using physical methods. This paper reviews the research and development process of nanopore sequencing technology (NST) from the laboratory to commercially viable tools; discusses the main types of nanopore sequencing technologies and their various applications in solving a wide range of real-world problems.

In this observational study, we performed small RNA and shotgun metagenomic sequencing in stool from 63 treated CD (tCD) and 3 untreated subjects as well as 66 sex- and age-matched healthy controls. tCD included 51 individuals on strict GFD and with negative transglutaminase (TG) serology (tCD-TG-) and 12 symptomatic with not strict/short-time of GFD adherence and positive TG serology (tCD-TG+). Samples from additional 40 healthy adult individuals and a cohort of 19 untreated pediatric CD subjects and 19 sex/age matched controls were analyzed to further test the outcomes. Several miRNA and microbial profiles were altered in tCD subjects (adj. p < .05). Findings were validated in the external group of adult controls. In tCD-TG-, GFD duration correlated with five miRNA levels (p < .05): for miR-4533-3p and miR-2681-3p, the longer the diet adherence, the less the expression differed from controls. tCD-TG+ and untreated pediatric CD patients showed a similar miRNA dysregulation.

However, the links between the underlying epigenetic features and the ISG profile are not well understood.

A large fraction of ISGs and STAT-binding sites was cell type specific with promoter binding of a STAT1/2 complex being a key driver of ISGs. Furthermore, STAT1/2 binding to putative enhancers induced ISGs as inferred from a chromatin co-accessibility analysis. STAT1/2 binding was dependent on the chromatin context and positively correlated with preexisting H3K4me1 and H3K27ac marks in an open chromatin state, whereas the presence of H3K27me3 had an inhibitory effect.

Beyond stochastic and fleeting encounters related to the polymeric nature of chromatin, experiments have revealed specific, privileged patterns of interactions that suggest the existence of basic organizing principles of folding. In this review, we focus on two major and recently proposed physical processes of chromatin organization: loop-extrusion and polymer phase-separation, both supported by increasing experimental evidence. We discuss their implementation into polymer physics models, which we test against available single-cell super-resolution imaging data, showing that both mechanisms can cooperate to shape chromatin structure at the single-molecule level. Next, by exploiting the comprehension of the underlying molecular mechanisms, we illustrate how such polymer models can be used as powerful tools to make predictions in silico that can complement experiments in understanding genome folding. To this aim, we focus on recent key applications, such as the prediction of chromatin structure rearrangements upon disease-associated mutations and the identification of the putative chromatin organizing factors that orchestrate the specificity of DNA regulatory contacts genome-wide."

Unfortunately, POC analysis is somewhat limited by the ability to manufacture simple devices to selectively measure disease specific biomarkers and the need for invasive biological sampling. Next generation POCs are being developed that make use of microfluidic devices to detect biomarkers in biological fluids in a non-invasive manner, addressing the above-mentioned limitations. Microfluidic devices are desirable because they can provide the ability to perform additional sample processing steps not available in existing commercial diagnostics. As a result, they can provide more sensitive and selective analysis. While most POC methods make use of blood or urine as a sample matrix, there has been a growing push to use saliva as a diagnostic medium. Saliva represents an ideal non-invasive biofluid for detecting biomarkers because it is readily available in large quantities and analyte levels reflect those in blood. However, using saliva in microfluidic devices for POC diagnostics is a relatively new and an emerging field. The overarching aim of this review is to provide an update on recent literature focused on the use of saliva as a biological sample matrix in microfluidic devices. We will first cover the characteristics of saliva as a sample medium and then review microfluidic devices that are developed for the analysis of salivary biomarkers.© The author(s)."
"36669495","Web-accessible application for identifying pathogenic transcripts with RNA-seq: Increased sensitivity in diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorders.","Am J Hum Genet","For neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), a molecular diagnosis is key for management, predicting outcome, and counseling. Often, routine DNA-based tests fail to establish a genetic diagnosis in NDDs. Transcriptome analysis (RNA sequencing [RNA-seq]) promises to improve the diagnostic yield but has not been applied to NDDs in routine diagnostics. Here, we explored the diagnostic potential of RNA-seq in 96 individuals including 67 undiagnosed subjects with NDDs. We performed RNA-seq on single individuals' cultured skin fibroblasts, with and without cycloheximide treatment, and used modified OUTRIDER Z scores to detect gene expression outliers and mis-splicing by exonic and intronic outliers. Analysis was performed by a user-friendly web application, and candidate pathogenic transcriptional events were confirmed by secondary assays. We identified intragenic deletions, monoallelic expression, and pseudoexonic insertions but also synonymous and non-synonymous variants with deleterious effects on transcription, increasing the diagnostic yield for NDDs by 13%. We found that cycloheximide treatment and exonic/intronic Z score analysis increased detection and resolution of aberrant splicing. Importantly, in one individual mis-splicing was found in a candidate gene nearly matching the individual's specific phenotype. However, pathogenic splicing occurred in another neuronal-expressed gene and provided a molecular diagnosis, stressing the need to customize RNA-seq. Lastly, our web browser application allowed custom analysis settings that facilitate diagnostic application and ranked pathogenic transcripts as top candidates. Our results demonstrate that RNA-seq is a complementary method in the genomic diagnosis of NDDs and, by providing accessible analysis with improved sensitivity, our transcriptome analysis approach facilitates wider implementation of RNA-seq in routine genome diagnostics.Copyright © 2022 American Society of Human Genetics.

"36798358","Scalable co-sequencing of RNA and DNA from individual nuclei.","bioRxiv","The ideal technology for directly investigating the relationship between genotype and phenotype would analyze both RNA and DNA genome-wide and with single-cell resolution. However, existing tools lack the throughput required for comprehensive analysis of complex tumors and tissues. We introduce a highly scalable method for jointly profiling DNA and expression following nucleosome depletion (DEFND-seq). In DEFND-seq, nuclei are nucleosome-depleted, tagmented, and separated into individual droplets for mRNA and genomic DNA barcoding. Once nuclei have been depleted of nucleosomes, subsequent steps can be performed using the widely available 10x Genomics droplet microfluidic technology and commercial kits without experimental modification. We demonstrate the production of high-complexity mRNA and gDNA sequencing libraries from thousands of individual nuclei from both cell lines and archived surgical specimens for associating gene expression phenotypes with both copy number and single nucleotide variants."

Elucidating the chromatin landscape of ccRCC at the single-cell level could provide a deeper understanding of the functional states and regulatory dynamics underlying the disease. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq) on 19 ccRCC samples, and whole-exome sequencing was used to understand the heterogeneity between individuals. Single-cell transcriptome and chromatin accessibility maps of ccRCC were constructed to reveal the regulatory characteristics of different tumor cell subtypes in ccRCC. Two long noncoding RNAs (RP11-661C8.2 and CTB-164N12.1) were identified that promoted the invasion and migration of ccRCC, which was validated with in vitro experiments. Taken together, this study comprehensively characterized the gene expression and DNA regulation landscape of ccRCC, which could provide new insights into the biology and treatment of ccRCC.A comprehensive analysis of gene expression and DNA regulation in ccRCC using scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq reveals the DNA regulatory programs of ccRCC at the single-cell level.©2023 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research."
"36767006","Framework for Adoption of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) Globally in the Oncology Area.","Healthcare (Basel)","Radical new possibilities of improved treatment of cancer are on offer from an advanced medical technology already demonstrating its significance: next-generation sequencing (NGS). This refined testing provides unprecedentedly precise diagnoses and permits the use of focused and highly personalized treatments. However, across regions globally, many cancer patients will continue to be denied the benefits of NGS as long as some of the yawning gaps in its implementation remain unattended. The challenges at the regional and national levels are linked because putting the solutions into effect is highly dependent on cooperation between regional- and national-level cooperation, which could be hindered by shortfalls in interpretation or understanding. The aim of the paper was to define and explore the necessary conditions for NGS and make recommendations for effective implementation based on extensive exchanges with policy makers and stakeholders. As a result, the European Alliance for Personalised Medicine (EAPM) developed a maturity framework structured around demand-side and supply-side issues to enable interested stakeholders in different countries to self-evaluate according to a common matrix. A questionnaire was designed to identify the current status of NGS implementation, and it was submitted to different experts in different institutions globally. This revealed significant variability in the different aspects of NGS uptake. Within different regions globally, to ensure those conditions are right, this can be improved by linking efforts made at the national level, where patients have needs and where care is delivered, and at the global level, where major policy initiatives in the health field are underway or in preparation, many of which offer direct or indirect pathways for building those conditions. In addition, in a period when consensus is still incomplete and catching up is needed at a political level to ensure rational allocation of resources-even within individual countries-to enable the best ways to make the necessary provisions for NGS, a key recommendation is to examine where closer links between national and regional actions could complement, support, and mutually reinforce efforts to improve the situation for patients."
"36771407","Elevation of Intracellular Alpha-Ketoglutarate Levels Inhibits Osteoclastogenesis by Suppressing the NF-ÎºB Signaling Pathway in a PHD1-Dependent Manner.","Nutrients","Age-related osteoporosis, a high-prevalence disease in the aged population, is generally attributed to the excessive activity of osteoclasts. Most approved drugs treat osteoporosis by inhibition of osteoclasts. Although in vivo studies have shown that alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG), an intermediate in the TCA cycle, can ameliorate age-related osteoporosis, the effects of AKG on osteoclastogenesis and the underlying mechanism of its action have not been studied yet. Here, we showed that the elevation of intracellular AKG levels by supplementing dimethyl AKG (DM-AKG, a cell-permeable derivative of AKG) inhibits the receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclasts differentiation from primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) and RAW264.7 cells in vitro. We further found that DM-AKG treatment suppresses NF-κB signaling and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) during RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis in RAW264.7 cells. Interestingly, dimethyl oxalylglycine (DMOG), an AKG competitive inhibitor of AKG-dependent prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs), antagonizes the suppression of the RANKL-activated NF-κB signaling pathway caused by DM-AKG treatment. Furthermore, blocked PHD1 expression (also known as EglN2), instead of PHD2 or PHD3, was confirmed to reverse the DM-AKG treatment-induced suppression of the RANKL-activated NF-κB signaling pathway. Accordingly, blocked PHD1 expression antagonized the inhibitory effects of DM-AKG on osteoclastogenesis. Together, our finding suggests that the elevation of intracellular AKG levels inhibits osteoclastogenesis by suppressing RANKL-activated NF-κB signaling in a PHD1-dependent manner, which may provide a novel nutritional strategy for osteoporosis treatment."

Attracting uncritical advocacy, the theory culminates in a recent consensus by elite Chinese gynecologists in favor of ""root treatment"", intended to nip endometriosis in the bud. Correcting endometrial ""defects"" can gain further momentum by the presence of cancer-driver mutations such as KRAS mutations in the endometrium of women with endometriosis and the recent introduction of therapeutics aiming to rectify the effect of these mutations for cancer treatment. We provide a critical appraisal of evidence for endometrial aberrations in endometriosis and relevant experimental evidence. All available evidence of endometrial ""defect"" is invariably post hoc and may well be secondary to induced endometriosis. We propose that the theory of ""endometrial determinism"" needs to demonstrate a clear causal and a phylogenetic relationship between endometrial aberrations and endometriosis. We argue that while it is highly likely that endometriosis is a consequence of retrograde menstruation, the case that molecular aberrations as a sole or a necessary determinant remains to be proven. ""Root treatment"" is a worthy ambition but as of now it is close to a fanciful Utopia."

Cerebral microdialysis (CMD), in combination with the proximity extension assay (PEA) technique, has great potential in this field. By using PEA, we have previously screened >500 proteins from CMD samples collected from TBI patients. In this study, we customized a PEA panel prototype of 21 selected candidate protein biomarkers, involved in inflammation (13), neuroplasticity/-repair (six), and axonal injury (two). The aim was to study their temporal dynamics and relation to age, structural injury, and clinical outcome. Ten patients with severe TBI and CMD monitoring, who were treated in the Neurointensive Care Unit, Uppsala University Hospital, Sweden, were included. Hourly CMD samples were collected for up to 7 days after trauma and analyzed with the 21-plex PEA panel. Seventeen of the 21 proteins from the CMD sample analyses showed significantly different mean levels between days. Early peaks (within 48 h) were noted with interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, transforming growth factor alpha, brevican, junctional adhesion molecule B, and neurocan. C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 peaked after 3 days. Late peaks (>5 days) were noted with interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-2, MCP-3, urokinase-type plasminogen activator, Dickkopf-related protein 1, and DRAXIN. IL-8, neurofilament heavy chain, and TAU were biphasic. Age (above/below 22 years) interacted with the temporal dynamics of IL-6, IL-1ra, vascular endothelial growth factor, MCP-3, and TAU. There was no association between radiological injury (Marshall grade) or clinical outcome (Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale) with the protein expression pattern. The PEA method is a highly sensitive molecular tool for protein profiling from cerebral tissue in TBI. The novel TBI dedicated 21-plex panel showed marked regulation of proteins belonging to the inflammation, plasticity/repair, and axonal injury families. The method may enable important insights into complex injury processes on a molecular level that may be of value in future efforts to tailor pharmacological TBI trials to better address specific disease processes and optimize timing of treatments.© Philip Dyhrfort et al., 2023; Published by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc."

Previously, we identified an oncogenic splice variant,PIK3CD-S, conferring Idelalisib resistance in African American (AA) prostate cancer (PCa). In the current study, we employed a comprehensive analysis combining molecular biology, biochemistry, histology, in silico simulation, and in vitro functional assays to investigate thePIK3CD-Sexpression profiles in PCa samples and to elucidate the drug resistance mechanism mediated by PI3Kδ-S (encoded byPIK3CD-S). The immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR, and Western blot assays first confirmed that PI3Kδ-S is highly expressed in AA PCa. Compared with PCa expressing the full-length PI3Kδ-L, PCa expressing PI3Kδ-S exhibits enhanced drug resistance properties, including a higher cell viability, more antiapoptotic and invasive capacities, and constitutively activated PI3K/AKT signaling, in the presence of PI3Kδ/PI3K inhibitors (Idelalisib, Seletalisib, Wortmannin, and Dactolisib). Molecular docking, ATP-competitive assays, and PI3 kinase assays have further indicated a drastically reduced affinity of PI3Kδ inhibitors with PI3Kδ-S vs. PI3Kδ-L, attributed to the lack of core binding residues in the PI3Kδ-S catalytic domain. Additionally, SRSF2 has been identified as a critical splicing factor mediating exon 20 skipping inPIK3CDpre-mRNA. The inhibition of the SRSF2 activity by SRPIN340 successfully sensitizes AA PCa cells to PI3Kδ inhibitors, suggesting a novel therapeutic option for Idelalisib-resistant tumors."

Yet, ASD diagnosis is a lengthy process, in part due to the lack of reliable biomarkers. We recently applied RNA-sequencing of peripheral blood samples from 73 American and Israeli children with ASD and 26 neurotypically developing (NT) children to identify 10 genes with dysregulated blood expression levels in children with ASD. Machine learning (ML) analyzes data by computerized analytical model building and may be applied to building diagnostic tools based on the optimization of large datasets. Here, we present several ML-generated models, based on RNA expression datasets collected during our recently published RNA-seq study, as tentative tools for ASD diagnosis. Using the random forest classifier, two of our proposed models yield an accuracy of 82% in distinguishing children with ASD and NT children. Our proof-of-concept study requires refinement and independent validation by studies with far larger cohorts of children with ASD and NT children and should thus be perceived as starting point for building more accurate ML-based tools. Eventually, such tools may potentially provide an unbiased means to support the early diagnosis of ASD."

Currently, no study has explored the differences between non-CS-associated AP and CS-associated AP in terms of gene expression. Transcriptomic profiles of blood samples from patients with AP were retrieved from GSE194331 (non-CS-associated) and GSE149607 (CS-associated). GSE31568 was used to examine the linkage between non-CS-associated AP and the expression of micro RNAs (miRNAs). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, a gene regulatory network was constructed, and hub genes were defined. Subsequently, single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) scores of hub genes were calculated to represent their regulatory-level activity. A total of 1851 shared DEGs were identified between non-CS-associated and CS-associated AP. Neutrophils were significantly enriched in both conditions. In non-CS-associated AP, miRNAs including hsa-miR-21, hsa-miR-146a, and hsa-miR-106a demonstrated a lower expression level as compared with the healthy control. Furthermore, the expression patterns and regulatory activities were largely opposite between non-CS-associated and CS-associated AP, with significantly lower estimated neutrophils in the latter case. In summary, we found that the regulation of neutrophils was altered in AP. There was a different gene expression pattern and lower estimated neutrophil infiltration in CS-associated AP. Whether these findings are clinically significant requires further investigation."

However, many of these studies only include males, omitting pathophysiological features unique to females. The aim of this study is to characterize the MIS model in female rats using positron emission tomography (PET), structural magnetic resonance imaging (MR), and neuroplasticiy studies.Methods:In gestational day 15, Poly I:C (or Saline) was injected into pregnant Wistar rats to induce the MIS model.Imaging studies: [18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-PET scans of female-offspring were acquired at post-natal day (PND) 35 and PND100. Furthermore, T2-MR brain images were acquired in adulthood. Differences in FDG uptake and morphometry between groups were assessed with SPM12 and Regions of Interest (ROI) analyses.Ex vivo study: The density of parvalbumin expressing interneurons (PV), perineuronal nets (PNN), and parvalbumin expressing interneurons surrounded by perineuronal nets (PV-PNN) were evaluated in the prelimbic cortex and basolateral amygdala using confocal microscopy. ROIs and neuroplasticity data were analyzed by 2-sampleT-test and 2-way-ANOVA analyses, respectively.Results:A significant increase in brain metabolism was found in all animals at adulthood compared to adolescence. MIS hardly modified brain glucose metabolism in females, highlighting a significant hypometabolism in the thalamus at adulthood. In addition, MIS induced gray matter (GM) enlargements in the pituitary, hippocampus, substantia nigra, and cingulate cortex, and GM shrinkages in some thalamic nuclei, cerebelar areas, and brainstem. Moreover, MIS induced white matter shrinkages in the cerebellum, brainstem and corpus callosum, along with cerebrospinal fluid enlargements in the lateral and 4th ventricles. Finally, MIS reduced the density of PV, PNN, and PV-PNN in the basolateral amygdala.Conclusion:Our work showedin vivothe differential pattern of functional and morphometric affectation in the MIS model in females, as well as the deficits caused at the synaptic level according to sex.

Currently, many of the available approaches that use machine learning on omics data for predictive purposes make mistakes in several of the following key steps: experimental design, feature selection, data pre-processing, and algorithm selection. For this reason, we propose the current work as a guideline on how to confront the main challenges inherent to multi-omics human data. As such, a series of best practices and recommendations are also presented for each of the steps defined. In particular, the main particularities of each omics data layer, the most suitable preprocessing approaches for each source, and a compilation of best practices and tips for the study of disease development prediction using machine learning are described. Using examples of real data, we show how to address the key problems mentioned in multi-omics research (e.g., biological heterogeneity, technical noise, high dimensionality, presence of missing values, and class imbalance).

With likelihood and Bayesian approaches becoming either intractable or computationally unfeasible, machine learning, and in particular deep learning, algorithms are emerging as popular techniques for population genetic inferences. These approaches rely on algorithms that learn non-linear relationships between the input data and the model parameters being estimated through representation learning from training data sets. Deep learning algorithms currently employed in the field comprise discriminative and generative models with fully connected, convolutional, or recurrent layers. Additionally, a wide range of powerful simulators to generate training data under complex scenarios are now available. The application of deep learning to empirical data sets mostly replicates previous findings of demography reconstruction and signals of natural selection in model organisms. To showcase the feasibility of deep learning to tackle new challenges, we designed a branched architecture to detect signals of recent balancing selection from temporal haplotypic data, which exhibited good predictive performance on simulated data.

Gene expression can play a fundamental role in the early detection of cancer, as it is indicative of the biochemical processes in tissue and cells, as well as the genetic characteristics of an organism. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) microarrays and ribonucleic acid (RNA)-sequencing methods for gene expression data allow quantifying the expression levels of genes and produce valuable data for computational analysis. This study reviews recent progress in gene expression analysis for cancer classification using machine learning methods. Both conventional and deep learning-based approaches are reviewed, with an emphasis on the application of deep learning models due to their comparative advantages for identifying gene patterns that are distinctive for various types of cancers. Relevant works that employ the most commonly used deep neural network architectures are covered, including multi-layer perceptrons, as well as convolutional, recurrent, graph, and transformer networks. This survey also presents an overview of the data collection methods for gene expression analysis and lists important datasets that are commonly used for supervised machine learning for this task. Furthermore, we review pertinent techniques for feature engineering and data preprocessing that are typically used to handle the high dimensionality of gene expression data, caused by a large number of genes present in data samples.

This interaction promotes PEAR1 phosphorylation and disease associated AKT/mTOR signaling in vascular cells and platelets. Mice lacking SVEP1 have reduced platelet activation, and exogenous SVEP1 induces PEAR1-dependent activation of platelets.

"36716318","Therapeutic potential of IL6R blockade for the treatment of sepsis and sepsis-related death: A Mendelian randomisation study.","PLoS Med","Sepsis is characterised by dysregulated, life-threatening immune responses, which are thought to be driven by cytokines such as interleukin 6 (IL-6). Genetic variants in IL6R known to down-regulate IL-6 signalling are associated with improved Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes, a finding later confirmed in randomised trials of IL-6 receptor antagonists (IL6RAs). We hypothesised that blockade of IL6R could also improve outcomes in sepsis.We performed a Mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in and near IL6R to evaluate the likely causal effects of IL6R blockade on sepsis (primary outcome), sepsis severity, other infections, and COVID-19 (secondary outcomes). We weighted SNPs by their effect on CRP and combined results across them in inverse variance weighted meta-analysis, proxying the effect of IL6RA. Our outcomes were measured in UK Biobank, FinnGen, the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (HGI), and the GenOSept and GainS consortium. We performed several sensitivity analyses to test assumptions of our methods, including utilising variants around CRP and gp130 in a similar analysis. In the UK Biobank cohort (N = 486,484, including 11,643 with sepsis), IL6R blockade was associated with a decreased risk of our primary outcome, sepsis (odds ratio (OR) = 0.80; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 0.96, per unit of natural log-transformed CRP decrease). The size of this effect increased with severity, with larger effects on 28-day sepsis mortality (OR = 0.74; 95% CI 0.47 to 1.15); critical care admission with sepsis (OR = 0.48, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.78) and critical care death with sepsis (OR = 0.37, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.98). Similar associations were seen with severe respiratory infection: OR for pneumonia in critical care 0.69 (95% CI 0.49 to 0.97) and for sepsis survival in critical care (OR = 0.22; 95% CI 0.04 to 1.31) in the GainS and GenOSept consortium, although this result had a large degree of imprecision. We also confirm the previously reported protective effect of IL6R blockade on severe COVID-19 (OR = 0.69, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.84) in the COVID-19 HGI, which was of similar magnitude to that seen in sepsis. Sensitivity analyses did not alter our primary results. These results are subject to the limitations and assumptions of MR, which in this case reflects interpretation of these SNP effects as causally acting through blockade of IL6R, and reflect lifetime exposure to IL6R blockade, rather than the effect of therapeutic IL6R blockade.IL6R blockade is causally associated with reduced incidence of sepsis. Similar but imprecisely estimated results supported a causal effect also on sepsis related mortality and critical care admission with sepsis. These effects are comparable in size to the effect seen in severe COVID-19, where IL-6 receptor antagonists were shown to improve survival. These data suggest that a randomised trial of IL-6 receptor antagonists in sepsis should be considered.Copyright: © 2023 Hamilton et al.

Genetically proxied PCSK9 inhibition was associated with reduced risk of psoriasis (odds ratio, 0.69 per standard deviation reduction in LDL; 95% CI, 0.55-0.88; P = .003), which was replicated in FinnGen (odds ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.57-0.88; P = .002). Sensitivity analyses did not provide statistical evidence of bias from pleiotropy or genetic confounding. No robust association was found for HMGCR or NPC1L1 inhibition.This mendelian randomization study suggests that PCSK9 is implicated in psoriasis pathogenesis, and its inhibition is associated with reduced psoriasis risk. These findings potentially pave the way for future studies that may allow personalized selection of lipid-lowering drugs for those at risk of psoriasis."

The sequenced urinary exosomal miRNAs were further investigated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in a validation cohort (16 MsPGN patients and 16 healthy controls). Correlation and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were used to determine the association between clinical features and miRNA expression in MsPGN. Finally, fluorescencein situhybridization was performed to detect miRNA expression in the renal tissues of MsPGN patients.Five differentially expressed miRNAs (miR-125b-2-3p, miR-205-5p, let-7b-3p, miR-1262, and miR-548o-3p) were identified by qRT-PCR. The expression of these miRNAs correlated with ACR, 24hUpro, mAlb, UA, and combined yielded a ROC curve area of 0.916 in discriminating MsPGN patients from the controls. In addition, the expression of miR-205-5p, let-7b-3p, miR-1262, and miR-548o-3p was elevated in the MsPGN patient group, and miR-125b-2-3p was decreased in the MsPGN patient group.Differential expression of urinary exosomal miRNAs may pose a risk of MsPGN and help distinguish MsPGN patients from controls. Certain miRNA expressions may be associated with disease progression, contributing to the epigenetic understanding of the pathophysiology of MsPGN."

Cooperative evolution was enabled by promiscuous interactions between single-stranded regions in the loops of naturally forming stem-loop structures in RNAs. It was also shown that cooperative RNA stem-loops outcompete selfish ones and provide foundational self-constructive groups (ribosome, editosome, spliceosome,etc.). Self-empowerment from abiotic matter to biological behavior does not just occur at the beginning of biological evolution; it is also essential for all levels of socially interacting RNAs, cells and viruses.Copyright: © 2023 Villarreal L and Witzany G."

The main features are a stenotic or imperforate anus, dysplastic ears, and thumb malformations, and other common concerns are hearing impairments, foot malformations, and renal and heart defects. Most of the pathogenicSALL1variants are nonsense and frameshift, likely escaping nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and causing disease via a dominant-negative mechanism. Haploinsufficiency may result in mild phenotypes, but only four families with distinctSALL1deletions have been reported to date, with a few more being of larger size and also affecting neighboring genes. We report on a family with autosomal dominant hearing impairment and mild anal and skeletal anomalies, in whom a novel 350 kbSALL1deletion, spanning exon 1 and the upstream region, was identified by array comparative genomic hybridization. We review the clinical findings of known individuals withSALL1deletions and point out that the overall phenotype is milder, especially when compared with individuals who carry the recurrent p.Arg276Ter mutation, but with a possible higher risk of developmental delay. Chromosomal microarray analysis is still a valuable tool in the identification of atypical/mild TBS cases, which are likely underestimated."
"36661332","Men who inject opioids exhibit altered tRNA-Gly-GCC isoforms in semen.","Mol Hum Reprod","In addition to their role in protein translation, tRNAs can be cleaved into shorter, biologically active fragments called tRNA fragments (tRFs). Specific tRFs from spermatocytes can propagate metabolic disorders in second generations of mice. Thus, tRFs in germline cells are a mechanism of epigenetic inheritance. It has also been shown that stress and toxins can cause alterations in tRF patterns. We were therefore interested in whether injecting illicit drugs, a major stressor, impacts tRFs in germline cells. We sequenced RNA from spermatocytes and from semen-derived exosomes from people who inject illicit drugs (PWID) and from non-drug using controls, both groups of unknown fertility status. All PWID injected opioids daily, but most also used other illicit drugs. The tRF cleavage products from Gly-GCC tRNA were markedly different between spermatocytes from PWID compared to controls. Over 90% of reads in controls mapped to shorter Gly-GCC tRFs, while in PWID only 45% did. In contrast, only 4.1% of reads in controls mapped to a longer tRFs versus 45.6% in PWID. The long/short tRF ratio was significantly higher in PWID than controls (0.23 versus 0.16, P = 0.0128). We also report differential expression of a group of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) in semen-derived exosomes, including, among others, ACA14a, U19, and U3-3. Thus, PWID exhibited an altered cleavage pattern of tRNA-Gly-GCC in spermatocytes and an altered cargo of snoRNAs in semen-derived exosomes. Participants were not exclusively using opioids and were not matched with controls in terms of diet, chronic disease, or other stressors, so our finding are not conclusively linked to opioid use. However, all individuals in the PWID group did inject heroin daily. Our study indicates a potential for opioid injection and/or its associated multi-drug use habits and lifestyle changes to influence epigenetic inheritance.© The Author(s) 2023.

"36831672","Implications of Transglutaminase-Mediated Protein Serotonylation in the Epigenetic Landscape, Small Cell Lung Cancer, and Beyond.","Cancers (Basel)","In the case of small-cell lung carcinoma, the highly metastatic nature of the disease and the propensity for several chromatin modifiers to harbor mutations suggest that epigenetic manipulation may also be a promising route for oncotherapy, but histone deacetylase inhibitors on their own do not appear to be particularly effective, suggesting that there may be other regulatory parameters that dictate the effectiveness of vorinostat's reversal of histone deacetylation. Recent discoveries that serotonylation of histone H3 alters the permissibility of gene expression have led to renewed attention to this rare modification, as facilitated by transglutaminase 2, and at the same time introduce new questions about whether this modification belongs to a part of the concerted cohort of regulator events for modulating the epigenetic landscape. This review explores the mechanistic details behind protein serotonylation and its possible connections to the epigenome via histone modifications and glycan interactions and attempts to elucidate the role of transglutaminase 2, such that optimizations to existing histone deacetylase inhibitor designs or combination therapies may be devised for lung and other types of cancer."
"36831225","The Role and Mechanism of Transglutaminase 2 in Regulating Hippocampal Neurogenesis after Traumatic Brain Injury.","Cells","Traumatic brain injury usually results in neuronal loss and cognitive deficits. Promoting endogenous neurogenesis has been considered as a viable treatment option to improve functional recovery after TBI. However, neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) in neurogenic regions are often unable to migrate and differentiate into mature neurons at the injury site. Transglutaminase 2 (TGM2) has been identified as a crucial component of neurogenic niche, and significantly dysregulated after TBI. Therefore, we speculate that TGM2 may play an important role in neurogenesis after TBI, and strategies targeting TGM2 to promote endogenous neural regeneration may be applied in TBI therapy. Using a tamoxifen-inducedTgm2conditional knockout mouse line and a mouse model of stab wound injury, we investigated the role and mechanism of TGM2 in regulating hippocampal neurogenesis after TBI. We found thatTgm2was highly expressed in adult NSPCs and up-regulated after TBI. Conditional deletion ofTgm2resulted in the impaired proliferation and differentiation of NSPCs, whileTgm2overexpression enhanced the abilities of self-renewal, proliferation, differentiation, and migration of NSPCs after TBI. Importantly, injection of lentivirus overexpressing TGM2 significantly promoted hippocampal neurogenesis after TBI. Therefore, TGM2 is a key regulator of hippocampal neurogenesis and a pivotal therapeutic target for intervention following TBI."
"36695883","Type 2 transglutaminase in the nucleus: the new epigenetic face of a cytoplasmic enzyme.","Cell Mol Life Sci","One of the major mysteries in science is how it is possible to pack the cellular chromatin with a total length of over 1 m, into a small sphere with a diameter of 5 mm ""the nucleus"", and even more difficult to envisage how to make it functional. Although we know that compaction is achieved through the histones, however, the DNA needs to be accessible to the transcription machinery and this is allowed thanks to a variety of very complex epigenetic mechanisms. Either DNA (methylation) or post-translational modifications of histone proteins (acetylation, methylation, ubiquitination and sumoylation) play a crucial role in chromatin remodelling and consequently on gene expression. Recently the serotonylation and dopaminylation of the histone 3, catalyzed by the Transglutaminase type 2 (TG2), has been reported. These novel post-translational modifications catalyzed by a predominantly cytoplasmic enzyme opens a new avenue for future investigations on the enzyme function itself and for the possibility that other biological amines, substrate of TG2, can influence the genome regulation under peculiar cellular conditions. In this review we analyzed the nuclear TG2's biology by discussing both its post-translational modification of various transcription factors and the implications of its epigenetic new face. Finally, we will focus on the potential impact of these events in human diseases.© 2023. The Author(s)."

However, few studies have examined the genome-wide copy number landscape and immune content of matched cohorts with genetic ancestry data and clinical outcomes. Here, we assessed prostate cancer somatic copy number alterations (sCNA) and tumor immune content of a grade-matched, surgically treated cohort of 145 self-identified Black (BL) and 145 self-identified White (WH) patients with genetic ancestry estimation. A generalized linear model adjusted with age, preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and Gleason Grade Group and filtered for germline copy number variations (gCNV) identified 143 loci where copy number varied significantly by percent African ancestry, clustering on chromosomes 6p, 10q, 11p, 12p, and 17p. Multivariable Cox regression models adjusted for age, preoperative PSA levels, and Gleason Grade Group revealed that chromosome 8q gains (including MYC) were significantly associated with biochemical recurrence and metastasis, independent of genetic ancestry. Finally, Treg density in BL and WH patients was significantly correlated with percent genome altered, and these findings were validated in the TCGA cohort. Taken together, our findings identify specific sCNA linked to genetic ancestry and outcome in primary prostate cancer and demonstrate that Treg infiltration varies by global sCNA burden in primary disease."
"36839221","Can Ordering Groceries Online Support Diet Quality in Adults Who Live in Low Food Access and Low-Income Environments?","Nutrients","During the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. food assistance programs allowed the use of program benefits to order groceries online. We examined relationships between the food environment, food assistance, online grocery ordering, and diet quality among adults from one low-income, low food access community in Northeastern Connecticut during the pandemic. Via online survey, adults (n = 276) reported their perceived home and store food environments, food assistance participation, whether they ordered groceries online, and consumption frequency and liking of foods/beverages to calculate diet quality indices. Those who ordered groceries online (44.6%) were more likely to participate in food assistance programs and report greater diet quality. Perceived healthiness of store and home food environments was variable, with the ease of obtaining and selecting unhealthy foods in the neighborhood significantly greater than healthy foods. Healthier perceived home food environments were associated with significantly higher diet qualities, especially among individuals who participated in multiple food assistance programs. Ordering groceries online interacted with multiple measures of the food environment to influence diet quality. Generally, the poorest diet quality was observed among individuals who perceived their store and home food environments as least healthy and who did not order groceries online. Thus, ordering groceries online may support higher diet quality among adults who can use their food assistance for purchasing groceries online and who live in low-income, low-access food environments."

Here, we develop Cottrazm, integrating ST with hematoxylin and eosin histological image, and single-cell transcriptomics to delineate the tumor boundary connecting malignant and non-malignant cell spots in tumor tissues, deconvolute cell-type composition at spatial location, and reconstruct cell type-specific gene expression profiles at sub-spot level. We validate the performance of Cottrazm along the malignant-boundary-nonmalignant spatial axis. We identify specific macrophage and fibroblast subtypes localized around tumor boundary that interacted with tumor cells to generate a structural boundary, which limits T cell infiltration and promotes immune exclusion in tumor microenvironment. In this work, Cottrazm provides an integrated tool framework to dissect the tumor spatial microenvironment and facilitates the discovery of functional biological insights, thereby identifying therapeutic targets in oncologic ST datasets.© 2023.

Here we evaluated whether whole blood derived mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA-CN) is a biomarker of metformin response as measured by glucose reduction or weight loss.Using data from the trial of Metformin (n = 304) and AcaRbose (n = 300) in Chinese as the initial Hypoglycaemic treatment (MARCH), we examined the association between mtDNA-CN and two metformin response outcomes of HbA1c reduction and weight loss. The acarbose arm was used as a comparator group. Whole blood mtDNA-CN was estimated by deep whole genome sequencing with adjustments for confounders. Multiple linear regression and repeated measurement analyses were used to evaluate the association between mtDNA-CN and drug response outcomes.Here we show that glucose reduction is not significantly associated with mtDNA-CN and in either treatment arm. In the metformin arm, each increase of 1 SD in mtDNA-CN is significantly (P = 0.006) associated with a 0.43 kg more weight loss. Repeated measurement analysis shows that after 16 weeks of metformin monotherapy, patients in the top tertile of mtDNA-CN consistently lost 1.21 kg more weight than those in the bottom tertile (P < 0.001). In comparison, mtDNA-CN is not significantly associated with acarbose-induced weight loss.Patients with higher mtDNA-CN are likely to lose more weight upon metformin treatment, suggesting mtDNA-CN as a potential novel biomarker for more effective weight management in type 2 diabetes.© 2023.

"36778490","The influence of maternal factors on the neonatal microbiome and health.","Res Sq","The human microbiome plays an essential role in human health. However, the influence of maternal factors on the neonatal microbiome remains obscure. Herein, our observations suggest that the neonatal buccal microbiome is similar to the maternal buccal microbiome, but the neonatal gastrointestinal microbiome develops a unique composition at an early stage. The low complexity of the neonatal buccal microbiome is a hallmark of maternal and neonatal health, but that of the neonatal gastrointestinal microbiome is associated with maternal inflammation-related metabolites. Microbial infections in the maternal reproductive tract universally impact the complexity of the neonatal microbiomes, and the body site is most important in modulating the composition of the neonatal microbiomes. Additionally, maternal lipids attenuated the adverse influence of several maternal factors on the neonatal microbiomes. Finally, admission of neonates to the newborn intensive care unit is associated with sub-optimal states of the maternal buccal and rectal microbiomes and maternal health."
"36633666","Concepts of association between cancer and ionising radiation: accounting for specific biological mechanisms.","Radiat Environ Biophys","The probability that an observed cancer was caused by radiation exposure is usually estimated using cancer rates and risk models from radioepidemiological cohorts and is called assigned share (AS). This definition implicitly assumes that an ongoing carcinogenic process is unaffected by the studied radiation exposure. However, there is strong evidence that radiation can also accelerate an existing clonal development towards cancer. In this work, we define different association measures that an observed cancer was newly induced, accelerated, or retarded. The measures were quantified exemplarily by Monte Carlo simulations that track the development of individual cells. Three biologically based two-stage clonal expansion (TSCE) models were applied. In the first model, radiation initiates cancer development, while in the other two, radiation has a promoting effect, i.e. radiation accelerates the clonal expansion of pre-cancerous cells. The parameters of the TSCE models were derived from breast cancer data from the atomic bomb survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. For exposure at age 30, all three models resulted in similar estimates of AS at age 60. For the initiation model, estimates of association were nearly identical to AS. However, for the promotion models, the cancerous clonal development was frequently accelerated towards younger ages, resulting in associations substantially higher than AS. This work shows that the association between a given cancer and exposure in an affected person depends on the underlying biological mechanism and can be substantially larger than the AS derived from classic radioepidemiology.© 2022.

"36847936","Epigenetic Regulation of Ferroptosis in Central Nervous System Diseases.","Mol Neurobiol","Ferroptosis, a newly identified form of cell death, is characterized by iron overload and accumulation of lipid reactive oxygen species. Inactivation of pathways, such as glutathione/glutathione peroxidase 4, NAD(P)H/ferroptosis suppressor protein 1/ubiquinone, dihydroorotate dehydrogenase/ubiquinol, or guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase-1/6(R)-L-erythro-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin pathways, have been found to induce ferroptosis. The accumulating data suggest that epigenetic regulation can determine cell sensitivity to ferroptosis at both the transcriptional and translational levels. While many of the effectors that regulate ferroptosis have been mapped, epigenetic regulation in ferroptosis is not yet fully understood. Neuronal ferroptosis is a driver in several central nervous system (CNS) diseases, such as stroke, Parkinson's disease, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury, and thus, research on how to inhibit neuronal ferroptosis is required to develop novel therapies for these diseases. In this review, we have summarized epigenetic regulation of ferroptosis in these CNS diseases, focusing in particular on DNA methylation, non-coding RNA regulation, and histone modification. Understanding epigenetic regulation in ferroptosis will hasten the development of promising therapeutic strategies in CNS diseases associated with ferroptosis.© 2023.

Though many clinical trials have looked at therapies for DCI and vasospasm in aSAH, along with reducing rebleeding risks, none have led to improving outcomes in this patient population. We present an up-to-date review of the pathophysiology of DCI and its association with early brain injury (EBI).Recent Findings:Recent studies have demonstrated that EBI, as opposed to delayed brain injury, is the main contributor to downstream pathophysiological mechanisms that play a role in the development of DCI. New predictive models, including advanced monitoring and neuroimaging techniques, can help detect EBI and improve the clinical management of aSAH patients.Summary:EBI, the severity of subarachnoid hemorrhage, and physiological/imaging markers can serve as indicators for potential early therapeutics in aSAH. The microcellular milieu and hemodynamic pathomechanisms should remain a focus of researchers and clinicians. With the advancement in understanding the pathophysiology of DCI, we are hopeful that we will make strides toward better outcomes for this unique patient population."
"36685821","Using publicly available datasets to identify population-based transcriptomic landscape contributing to the aggressiveness of breast cancer in young women.","Front Genet","Introduction:Although the risk of breast cancer increases with advancing age, some regions have larger number of young breast cancer patients (≤45 years-old), such as the Middle East, Eastern Asia, and North Africa, with more aggressive and poorly differentiated tumors. We aimed to conduct anin-silicoanalysis in an attempt to understand the aggressive nature of early-onset breast cancer, and to identify potential drivers of early-onset breast cancer using gene expression profiling datasets in a population-dependent manner.Methods:Functional genomics experiments data were acquired from cBioPortal database for cancer genomics, followed by the stratification of patients based on the age at representation of breast cancer and race. Differential gene expression analysis and gene amplification status analysis were carried out, followed by hub gene, transcription factor, and signalling pathway identification.Results:PAM50 subtype analysis revealed that young patients (≤45 years-old) had four-fold more basal tumors and worst progression-free survival (median of 101 months), compared with the 45-65 years group (median of 168 months). Fourteen genes were amplified in more than 14% of patients with an early-onset breast cancer. Interestingly, FREM2, LINC00332, and LINC00366 were exclusively amplified in younger patients. Gene expression data from three different populations (Asian, White, and African) revealed a unique transcriptomic profile of young patients, which was also reflected on the PAM50 subtype analysis. Our data indicates a higher tendency of young African patients to develop basal tumors, while young Asian patients are more prone to developing Luminal A tumors. Most genes that were found to be upregulated in younger patients are involved in important signaling pathways that promote cancer progression and metastasis, such as MAPK pathway, Reelin pathway and the PI3K/Akt pathway.Conclusion:This study provides strong evidence that the molecular profile of tumors derived from young breast cancer patients of different populations is unique and may explain the aggressiveness of these tumors, stressing the need to conduct population- based multi-omic analyses to identify the potential drivers for tumorigenesis and molecular profiles of young breast cancer patients.Copyright © 2023 Tabbal, Hachim, Jan and Adrian."

FM rupture at term implicates different sterile inflammation mechanisms including pathways activated by the transmembrane glycoprotein receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. As the protein kinase CK2 is also implicated in the inflammation process, we aimed to characterize the expressions of RAGE and the protein kinase CK2 as a candidate regulator of RAGE expression. The amnion and choriodecidua were collected from FM explants and/or primary amniotic epithelial cells throughout pregnancy and at term in spontaneous labor (TIL) or term without labor (TNL). The mRNA and protein expressions of RAGE and the CK2α, CK2α', and CK2β subunits were investigated using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot assays. Their cellular localizations were determined with microscopic analyses, and the CK2 activity level was measured. RAGE and the CK2α, CK2α', and CK2β subunits were expressed in both FM layers throughout pregnancy. At term, RAGE was overexpressed in the amnion from the TNL samples, whereas the CK2 subunits were expressed at the same level in the different groups (amnion/choriodecidua/amniocytes, TIL/TNL), without modification of the CK2 activity level and immunolocalization. This work paves the way for future experiments regarding the regulation of RAGE expression by CK2 phosphorylation."

An accurate, sensitive, and rapid method to detect P. aeruginosa is critical for the early control of infection and patient management. In this study, we established a P. aeruginosa clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats testing in one pot (CRISPR-top) assay which detected P. aeruginosa with one fluid-handling step in one tube. The reaction was performed isothermally within 1 h; thus, specific instruments were not required. The optimal reaction conditions of this assay were determined to be a temperature of 55°C; working concentrations of 1 μM for the forward inner primer and backward inner primer, 0.5 μM for the loop forward primer and loop backward primer, and 0.25 μM for the forward outer primer and backward outer primer; as well as a 2 μM concentration single-stranded DNA reporter molecules. In terms of specificity, our assay showed 100% inclusivity and exclusivity among 48 strains, including 15 P. aeruginosa clinical isolates and 33 non-P. aeruginosa strains. The limit of detection of our method was 10 copies per reaction mixture. Forty-six human sputum specimens from patients with respiratory symptoms were tested. Using the results of quantitative real-time PCR as the gold standard, our method showed 85.3% (29/34) sensitivity, 100% (12/12) specificity, a positive predictive value of 100% (29/29), and a negative predictive value of 70.6% (12/17). In summary, the P. aeruginosa CRISPR-top assay developed in the present study is a high-efficiency alternative tool for the accurate and rapid detection of P. aeruginosa, especially in resource-limited settings.IMPORTANCEThis study reports a P. aeruginosa CRISPR-top assay which can precisely identify P. aeruginosa using nucleic acids from pure cultures or clinical samples in one pot with one fluid-handling step.

Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) are the two major types of ECs, with EAC having one of the worst prognoses in oncology. Limited screening techniques and a lack of molecular analysis of diseased tissues have led to late-stage presentation and very low survival durations. The five-year survival rate of EC is less than 20%. Thus, early diagnosis of EC may prolong survival and improve clinical outcomes. Cellular and molecular biomarkers are used for diagnosis. At present, esophageal biopsy during upper endoscopy and histopathological analysis is the standard screening modality for both ESCC and EAC. However, this is an invasive method that fails to yield a molecular profile of the diseased compartment. To decrease the invasiveness of the procedures for diagnosis, researchers are proposing non-invasive biomarkers for early diagnosis and point-of-care screening options. Liquid biopsy involves the collection of body fluids (blood, urine, and saliva) non-invasively or with minimal invasiveness. In this review, we have critically discussed various biomarkers and specimen retrieval techniques for ESCC and EAC."

However, major questions about how epigenetic modifications regulate the immune microenvironment during the decidualization process and embryo implantation remain unanswered. DNA methylation, the main epigenetic mechanism involved in the endometrial cycle, is crucial for specific transcriptional networks associated with endometrial stromal cell (ESC) proliferation, hormone response, decidualization, and embryo implantation. Ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes, responsible for catalyzing the conversion of 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcyosine, 5-formylytosine, and 5-carboxylcyosine to achieve the DNA demethylation process, appear to play a critical role in decidualization and embryo implantation. Here, we provide a comprehensive view of their structural similarities and the common mechanism of regulation in the microenvironment at the maternal-fetal interface during decidualization and early pregnancy. We also discuss their physiological role in the decidual immune microenvironment. Finally, we propose a key hypothesis regarding TET enzymes at the maternal-fetal interface between decidual immune cells and ESCs. Future work is needed to elucidate their functional role and examine therapeutic strategies targeting these enzymes in pregnancy-related disease preclinical models, which would be of great value for future implications in disease diagnosis or treatment.Copyright © 2023 Jin, Ji, Chen, Zhou, Wang and Liu."
"36844425","Missing data in multi-omics integration: Recent advances through artificial intelligence.","Front Artif Intell","Biological systems function through complex interactions between various 'omics (biomolecules), and a more complete understanding of these systems is only possible through an integrated, multi-omic perspective. This has presented the need for the development of integration approaches that are able to capture the complex, often non-linear, interactions that define these biological systems and are adapted to the challenges of combining the heterogenous data across 'omic views. A principal challenge to multi-omic integration is missing data because all biomolecules are not measured in all samples. Due to either cost, instrument sensitivity, or other experimental factors, data for a biological sample may be missing for one or more 'omic techologies. Recent methodological developments in artificial intelligence and statistical learning have greatly facilitated the analyses of multi-omics data, however many of these techniques assume access to completely observed data. A subset of these methods incorporate mechanisms for handling partially observed samples, and these methods are the focus of this review. We describe recently developed approaches, noting their primary use cases and highlighting each method's approach to handling missing data. We additionally provide an overview of the more traditional missing data workflows and their limitations; and we discuss potential avenues for further developments as well as how the missing data issue and its current solutions may generalize beyond the multi-omics context.Copyright © 2023 Flores, Claborne, Weller, Webb-Robertson, Waters and Bramer."
"36835813","Artificial Intelligence-Assisted Transcriptomic Analysis to Advance Cancer Immunotherapy.","J Clin Med","The emergence of immunotherapy has dramatically changed the cancer treatment paradigm and generated tremendous promise in precision medicine. However, cancer immunotherapy is greatly limited by its low response rates and immune-related adverse events. Transcriptomics technology is a promising tool for deciphering the molecular underpinnings of immunotherapy response and therapeutic toxicity. In particular, applying single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) has deepened our understanding of tumor heterogeneity and the microenvironment, providing powerful help for developing new immunotherapy strategies. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology in transcriptome analysis meets the need for efficient handling and robust results. Specifically, it further extends the application scope of transcriptomic technologies in cancer research. AI-assisted transcriptomic analysis has performed well in exploring the underlying mechanisms of drug resistance and immunotherapy toxicity and predicting therapeutic response, with profound significance in cancer treatment. In this review, we summarized emerging AI-assisted transcriptomic technologies. We then highlighted new insights into cancer immunotherapy based on AI-assisted transcriptomic analysis, focusing on tumor heterogeneity, the tumor microenvironment, immune-related adverse event pathogenesis, drug resistance, and new target discovery. This review summarizes solid evidence for immunotherapy research, which might help the cancer research community overcome the challenges faced by immunotherapy."
"36845552","The effect of a methyl group on structure and function: Serine vs. threonine glycosylation and phosphorylation.","Front Mol Biosci","A variety of glycan structures cover the surface of all cells and are involved in myriad biological processes, including but not limited to, cell adhesion and communication, protein quality control, signal transduction and metabolism, while also being intimately involved in innate and adaptive immune functions. Immune surveillance and responses to foreign carbohydrate antigens, such as capsular polysaccharides on bacteria and surface protein glycosylation of viruses, are the basis of microbial clearance, and most antimicrobial vaccines target these structures. In addition, aberrant glycans on tumors called Tumor-Associated Carbohydrate Antigens (TACAs) elicit immune responses to cancer, and TACAs have been used in the design of many antitumor vaccine constructs. A majority of mammalian TACAs are derived from what are referred to as mucin-type O-linked glycans on cell-surface proteins and are linked to the protein backbone through the hydroxyl group of either serine or threonine residues. A small group of structural studies that have compared mono- and oligosaccharides attached to each of these residues have shown that there are distinct differences in conformational preferences assumed by glycans attached to either ""unmethylated"" serine orß-methylated threonine. This suggests that the linkage point of antigenic glycans will affect their presentation to the immune system as well as to various carbohydrate binding molecules (e.g., lectins). This short review, followed by our hypothesis, will examine this possibility and extend the concept to the presentation of glycans on surfaces and in assay systems where recognition of glycans by proteins and other binding partners can be defined by different attachment points that allow for a range of conformational presentations.Copyright © 2023 Barchi and Strain."
"36765119","Histone variant H2A.Z modulates nucleosome dynamics to promote DNA accessibility.","Nat Commun","Nucleosomes, containing histone variants H2A.Z, are important for gene transcription initiation and termination, chromosome segregation and DNA double-strand break repair, among other functions. However, the underlying mechanisms of how H2A.Z influences nucleosome stability, dynamics and DNA accessibility are not well understood, as experimental and computational evidence remains inconclusive. Our modeling efforts of human nucleosome stability and dynamics, along with comparisons with experimental data show that the incorporation of H2A.Z results in a substantial decrease of the energy barrier for DNA unwrapping. This leads to the spontaneous DNA unwrapping of about forty base pairs from both ends, nucleosome gapping and increased histone plasticity, which otherwise is not observed for canonical nucleosomes. We demonstrate that both N- and C-terminal tails of H2A.Z play major roles in these events, whereas the H3.3 variant exerts a negligible impact in modulating the DNA end unwrapping. In summary, our results indicate that H2A.Z deposition makes nucleosomes more mobile and DNA more accessible to transcriptional machinery and other chromatin components.© 2023. The Author(s)."

The functional identification of 6mA methyltransferase will be important for understanding the underlying molecular mechanism of epigenetic 6mA methylation. It has been reported that the methyltransferase METTL4 can catalyze the methylation of 6mA; however, the function of METTL4 remains largely unknown. In this study, we aim to investigate the role of theBombyx morihomolog METTL4 (BmMETTL4) in silkworm, a lepidopteran model insect. By using CRISPR-Cas9 system, we somatically mutated BmMETTL4 in silkworm individuates and found that disruption of BmMETTL4 caused the developmental defect of late silkworm embryo and subsequent lethality. We performed RNA-Seq and identified that there were 3192 differentially expressed genes in BmMETTL4 mutant including 1743 up-regulated and 1449 down-regulated. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses showed that genes involved in molecular structure, chitin binding, and serine hydrolase activity were significantly affected by BmMETTL4 mutation. We further found that the expression of cuticular protein genes and collagens were clearly decreased while collagenases were highly increased, which had great contributions to the abnormal embryo and decreased hatchability of silkworm. Taken together, these results demonstrated a critical role of 6mA methyltransferase BmMETTL4 in regulating embryonic development of silkworm."
"36707911","Integrated investigation of the clinical implications and targeted landscape for RNA methylation modifications in hepatocellular carcinoma.","Eur J Med Res","RNA methylation (RM) is a crucial post-translational modification (PTM) that directs epigenetic regulation. It mostly consists of N1-methyladenosine (m1A), 5-methylcytosine (m5C), N3-methylcytidine (m3C), N6-methyladenosine (m6A), and 2'-O-methylation (Nm). The ""writers"" mainly act as intermediaries between these modifications and associated biological processes. However, little is known about the interactions and potential functions of these RM writers in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).The expression properties and genetic alterations of 38 RM writers were assessed in HCC samples from five bioinformatic datasets. Two patterns associated with RM writers were identified using consensus clustering. Then, utilizing differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from different RM subtypes, we built a risk model called RM_Score. Additionally, we investigated the correlation of RM_Score with clinical characteristics, tumor microenvironment (TME) infiltration, molecular subtypes, therapeutic response, immunotherapy effectiveness, and competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network.RM writers were correlated with TME cell infiltration and prognosis. Cluster_1/2 and gene.cluster_A/B were shown to be capable of distinguishing the HCC patients with poor prognosis after consensus and unsupervised clustering of RNA methylation writers. Additionally, we constructed RNA modification pattern-specific risk model and subdivided the cases into RM_Score high and RM_Score low subgroups. In individual cohorts or merged datasets, the high RM_Score was related to a worse overall survival of HCC patients. RM_Score also exhibited correlations with immune and proliferation related pathways. In response to anti-cancer treatments, the RM_Score had a negative correlation (drug sensitive) with drugs that focused on the MAPK/ERK and metabolism signaling, and a positive correlation (drug resistant) with compounds targeting RKT and PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway. Notably, the RM_Score was connected to the therapeutic effectiveness of PD-L1 blockage, implying that RM writers may be the target of immunotherapy to optimize clinical outcomes. Additionally, a ceRNA network was generated including 2 lncRNAs, 4 miRNAs, and 7 mRNAs that was connected to RM writers.We thoroughly investigated the potential functions of RNA methylation writers and established an RM_patterns-based risk model for HCC patients. This study emphasized the critical functions of RM modification in TME infiltration, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, providing potential targets for HCC.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Meanwhile, network-based computational biology approaches, which allow the integration of information from different aspects to understand the relationships between biomolecules, has been successfully applied to drug repurposing. In this work, we developed a new strategy for network-based drug repositioning against cancer. Combining the mechanism of action and clinical efficacy of the drugs, a cancer-related drug similarity network was constructed, and the correlation score of each drug with a specific cancer was quantified. The top 5% of scoring drugs were reviewed for stability and druggable potential to identify potential repositionable drugs. Of the 11 potentially repurposable drugs for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 10 were confirmed by clinical trial articles and databases. The targets of these drugs were significantly enriched in cancer-related pathways and significantly associated with the prognosis of NSCLC. In light of the successful application of our approach to colorectal cancer as well, it provides an effective clue and valuable perspective for drug repurposing in cancer."

Here, we describe ReDACT (Restoring Disomy in Aneuploid cells using CRISPR Targeting), a set of chromosome engineering tools that allow us to eliminate specific aneuploidies from cancer genomes. Using ReDACT, we created a panel of isogenic cells that have or lack common aneuploidies, and we demonstrate that trisomy of chromosome 1q is required for malignant growth in cancers harboring this alteration. Mechanistically, gaining chromosome 1q increases the expression of MDM4 and suppresses TP53 signaling, and we show that TP53 mutations are mutually-exclusive with 1q aneuploidy in human cancers. Thus, specific aneuploidies play essential roles in tumorigenesis, raising the possibility that targeting these ""aneuploidy addictions"" could represent a novel approach for cancer treatment."

With next-generation sequencing, a 61-gene panel was used to evaluate plasma cell-free DNA and white blood cell genomic DNA from patients with ESCC. We analyzed the relationship between the mutation features of ctDNA and the prognosis of patients with ESCC, identified candidate risk predictors by Cox analysis, and developed nomogram models to predict the 2- and 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). The area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, concordance index (C-index), calibration plot, and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) were used to evaluate the performance of the nomogram model. The model was compared with the traditional tumor-nodes-metastasis (TNM) staging system.The ROC curve showed that the average mutant allele frequency (MAF) of ctDNA variants and the number of ctDNA variants were potential biomarkers for predicting the prognosis of patients with ESCC. The predictors included in the models were common candidate predictors of ESCC, such as lymph node stage, angiolymphatic invasion, drinking history, and ctDNA characteristics. The calibration curve demonstrated consistency between the observed and predicted results. Moreover, our nomogram models showed clear prognostic superiority over the traditional TNM staging system (based on C-index, 2-year DFS: 0.82 vs. 0.64; 5-year DFS: 0.78 vs. 0.65; 2-year OS: 0.80 vs. 0.66; 5-year OS: 0.77 vs. 0.66; based on IDI, 2-year DFS: 0.33,p <0.001; 5-year DFS: 0.18,p= 0.04; 2-year OS: 0.28,p <0.001; 5-year OS: 0.15,p= 0.04). The comprehensive scores of the nomogram models could be used to stratify patients with ESCC.The novel nomogram incorporating ctDNA features may help predict the prognosis of patients with resectable ESCC.

The perturbation of three-dimensional (3D) genome hierarchy may lead to a plethora of human diseases, including rheumatological disorders.

Included in the study were 174 intensive care unit (ICU) patients (day 8 ± 1) vs 19 matched controls, and 60 mice subjected to surgery/sepsis vs 60 pair-fed healthy mice. Interventions studied included 7-day neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES), and withholding parenteral nutrition (PN) in the first ICU week (late PN) vs early PN. The main outcome measures wereFNDC5(irisin- precursor),KYAT1, KYAT3, and amylase mRNA expression in skeletal muscle.Critically ill patients showed 34% to 80% lower mRNA expression ofFNDC5,KYAT1, and amylases than controls (P< .0001). Critically ill mice showed time-dependent reductions in all mRNAs compared with healthy mice (P≤ .04). The lowerFNDC5expression in patients was independently associated with a higher ICU mortality (P= .015) and ICU-acquired weakness (P= .012), whereas the lower amylase expression in ICU survivors was independently associated with a longer ICU stay (P= .0060).

"36859312","Molecular characterisation of 36 multilocus imprinting disturbance (MLID) patients: a comprehensive approach.","Clin Epigenetics","Imprinting disorders (ImpDis) comprise diseases which are caused by aberrant regulation of monoallelically and parent-of-origin-dependent expressed genes. A characteristic molecular change in ImpDis patients is aberrant methylation signatures at disease-specific loci, without an obvious DNA change at the specific differentially methylated region (DMR). However, there is a growing number of reports on multilocus imprinting disturbances (MLIDs), i.e. aberrant methylation at different DMRs in the same patient. These MLIDs account for a significant number of patients with specific ImpDis, and several reports indicate a central role of pathogenic maternal effect variants in their aetiology by affecting the maturation of the oocyte and the early embryo. Though several studies on the prevalence and the molecular causes of MLID have been conducted, homogeneous datasets comprising both genomic and methylation data are still lacking.Based on a cohort of 36 MLID patients, we here present both methylation data obtained from next-generation sequencing (NGS, ImprintSeq) approaches and whole-exome sequencing (WES). The compilation of methylation data did not reveal a disease-specific MLID episignature, and a predisposition for the phenotypic modification was not obvious as well. In fact, this lack of epigenotype-phenotype correlation might be related to the mosaic distribution of imprinting defects and their functional relevance in specific tissues.Due to the higher sensitivity of NGS-based approaches, we suggest that ImprintSeq might be offered at reference centres in case of ImpDis patients with unusual phenotypes but MLID negative by conventional tests. By WES, additional MLID causes than the already known maternal effect variants could not be identified, neither in the patients nor in the maternal exomes. In cases with negative WES results, it is currently unclear to what extent either environmental factors or undetected genetic variants contribute to MLID.© 2023. The Author(s)."

We used log-normal, ordinary kriging to estimate daily mean concentrations of PM10, NO, NO2, and SO2at participants' geocoded addresses (1-, 3-, and 5-year averages before BMD assessments). We measured whole-body, total hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spine BMD at enrollment and follow-up (Y1, Y3, Y6) via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. We estimated associations using multivariable linear and linear mixed-effects models and mixture effects using Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) models.In cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses, mean PM10, NO, NO2, and SO2averaged over 1, 3, and 5 years before the visit were negatively associated with whole-body, total hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spine BMD. For example, lumbar spine BMD decreased 0.026 (95% CI: 0.016, 0.036) g/cm2/year per a 10% increase in 3-year mean NO2concentration. BKMR suggested that nitrogen oxides exposure was inversely associated with whole-body and lumbar spine BMD.In this cohort study, higher levels of air pollutants were associated with bone damage, particularly on lumbar spine, among postmenopausal women. These findings highlight nitrogen oxides exposure as a leading contributor to bone loss in postmenopausal women, expanding previous findings of air pollution-related bone damage.US National Institutes of Health.© 2023 The Author(s)."

Exposure to phthalates during pregnancy has been associated with adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes and differences in placental gene expression in human studies. The objective of this research was to evaluate global changes in placental gene expression via RNA sequencing in two placental cell models following exposure to the phthalate metabolite mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP). HTR-8/SVneo and primary syncytiotrophoblast cells were exposed to three concentrations (1, 90, 180 µM) of MEHP for 24 h with DMSO (0.1%) as a vehicle control. mRNA and lncRNAs were quantified using paired-end RNA sequencing, followed by identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), significant KEGG pathways, and enriched transcription factors (TFs). MEHP caused gene expression changes across all concentrations for HTR-8/SVneo and primary syncytiotrophoblast cells. Sex-stratified analysis of primary cells identified different patterns of sensitivity in response to MEHP dose by sex, with male placentas being more responsive to MEHP exposure. Pathway analysis identified 11 KEGG pathways significantly associated with at least one concentration in both cell types. Four ligand-inducible nuclear hormone TFs (PPARG, PPARD, ESR1, AR) were enriched in at least three treatment groups. Overall, we demonstrated that MEHP differentially affects placental gene expression based on concentration, fetal sex, and trophoblast cell type. This study confirms prior studies, as enrichment of nuclear hormone receptor TFs were concordant with previously published mechanisms of phthalate disruption, and generates new hypotheses, as we identified many pathways and genes not previously linked to phthalate exposure.© 2023.

To date, genetic causes and underlying mechanisms for T2D remain unclear. SIRT1, one member of highly conserved NAD-dependent class III deacetylases, has been implicated in many human diseases. Accumulating evidence indicates that SIRT1 is involved in insulin resistance and impaired pancreaticβ-cell function, the two hallmarks of T2D. Thus, we speculated that altered SIRT1 levels, resulting from the genetic variants within its regulatory region ofSIRT1gene, may contribute to the T2D development. In this study, theSIRT1gene promoter was genetically analyzed in T2D patients (n = 218) and healthy controls (n = 358). A total of 20 genetic variants, including 7 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), were identified. Five heterozygous genetic variants (g.4114-15InsA, g.4801G > A, g.4816G > C, g.4934G > T, and g.4963_64Ins17bp) and one SNP (g.4198A > C (rs35706870)) were identified in T2D patients, but in none of the controls. The frequencies of two SNPs (g.4540A > G (rs3740051) (OR: 1.75, 95% CI: 1.24-2.47,P< 0.001 in dominant genetic model) and g.4821G > T (rs35995735)) (OR: 3.58, 95% CI: 1.94-6.60,P< 0.001 in dominant genetic model) were significantly higher in T2D patients. Further association and haplotype analyses confirmed that these two SNPs were strongly linked, contributing to the T2D (OR: 1.442, 95% CI: 1.080-1.927,P< 0.05). Moreover, most of the genetic variants identified in T2D were disease-specific. Taken together, the genetic variants withinSIRT1gene promoter might contribute to the T2D development by altering SIRT1 levels. Underlying molecular mechanism needs to be further explored.Copyright © 2023 Shuchao Pang et al."
"36711725","Epigenetics and stroke: role of DNA methylation and effect of aging on blood-brain barrier recovery.","Res Sq","Incomplete recovery of blood-brain barrier (BBB) function contributes to stroke outcomes. How the BBB recovers after stroke remains largely unknown. Emerging evidence suggests that epigenetic factors play a significant role in regulating post-stroke BBB recovery. This study aimed to evaluate the epigenetic and transcriptional profile of cerebral microvessels after thromboembolic (TE) stroke to define potential causes of limited BBB recovery. RNA-sequencing and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) analyses were performed using microvessels isolated from young (6 months) and old (18 months) mice seven days poststroke compared to age-matched sham controls. DNA methylation profiling of poststroke brain microvessels revealed 11287 differentially methylated regions (DMR) in old and 9818 DMR in young mice, corresponding to annotated genes. These DMR were enriched in genes encoding cell structural proteins (e.g., cell junction, and cell polarity, actin cytoskeleton, extracellular matrix), transporters and channels (e.g., potassium transmembrane transporter, organic anion and inorganic cation transporters, calcium ion transport), and proteins involved in endothelial cell processes (e.g., angiogenesis/vasculogenesis, cell signaling and transcription regulation). Integrated analysis of methylation and RNA sequencing identified changes in cell junctions (occludin), actin remodeling (ezrin) as well as signaling pathways like Rho GTPase (RhoA and Cdc42ep4). Aging as a hub of aberrant methylation affected BBB recovery processes by profound alterations (hypermethylation and repression) in structural protein expression (e.g., claudin-5) as well as activation of a set of genes involved in endothelial to mesenchymal transformation (e.g.,Sox17,Snail1), repression of angiogenesis and epigenetic regulation. These findings revealed that DNA methylation plays an important role in regulating BBB repair after stroke, through regulating processes associated with BBB restoration and prevalently with processes enhancing BBB injury."

Isolation of DNA and RNA from human tissues is necessary to analyze multi-omic data sets, providing information on the single-cell genome, transcriptome, and epigenome. Here, we isolated high-quality single-nuclei from postmortem human heart tissues for DNA and RNA analysis. Postmortem human tissues were obtained from 106 individuals, 33 with a history of myocardial disease, diabetes, or smoking, and 73 controls without heart disease. We demonstrated that the Qiagen EZ1 instrument and kit consistently isolated genomic DNA of high yield, which can be used for checking DNA quality before conducting single-cell experiments. Here, we provide a method for single-nuclei isolation from cardiac tissue, otherwise known as the SoNIC method, which allows for the isolation of single cardiomyocyte nuclei from postmortem tissue by nuclear ploidy status. We also provide a detailed quality control measure for single-nuclei whole genome amplification and a pre-amplification method for confirming genomic integrity."
"36821425","CLAIRE: contrastive learning-based batch correction framework for better balance between batch mixing and preservation of cellular heterogeneity.","Bioinformatics","Integration of growing single-cell RNA sequencing datasets helps better understand cellular identity and function. The major challenge for integration is removing batch effects while preserving biological heterogeneities. Advances in contrastive learning have inspired several contrastive learning-based batch correction methods. However, existing contrastive-learning-based methods exhibit noticeable ad hoc trade-off between batch mixing and preservation of cellular heterogeneities (mix-heterogeneity trade-off). Therefore, a deliberate mix-heterogeneity trade-off is expected to yield considerable improvements in scRNA-seq dataset integration.We develop a novel contrastive learning-based batch correction framework, CIAIRE, which achieves superior mix-heterogeneity trade-off. The key contributions of CLAIRE are proposal of two complementary strategies: construction strategy and refinement strategy, to improve the appropriateness of positive pairs. Construction strategy dynamically generates positive pairs by augmenting inter-batch mutual nearest neighbors (MNN) with intra-batch k-nearest neighbors (KNN), which improves the coverage of positive pairs for the whole distribution of shared cell types between batches. Refinement strategy aims to automatically reduce the potential false positive pairs from the construction strategy, which resorts to the memory effect of deep neural networks. We demonstrate that CLAIRE possesses superior mix-heterogeneity trade-off over existing contrastive learning-based methods. Benchmark results on six real datasets also show that CLAIRE achieves the best integration performance against eight state-of-the-art methods. Finally, comprehensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of CLAIRE.The source code and data used in this study can be found in https://github.com/CSUBioGroup/CLAIRE-release.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.© The Author(s) 2023.

"36778499","Genetically Defined Subtypes of Layer 5 Somatostatin-Containing Cortical Interneurons.","bioRxiv","Of the four main subclasses of inhibitory cortical interneurons, somatostatin-containing (SOM) interneurons are the most diverse. Earlier studies identified layer 1-projecting (Martinotti) cells in layer 5/6 of the X98 and the Chrna2-cre transgenic lines, and two groups of non-Martinotti cells - long-range projecting SOM cells in layers 2 and 6, and layer 4-projecting X94 cells in layers 4 and 5. Later in-vivo and ex-vivo studies described two morphological types of Martinotti cells which appear to have opposing roles in behaving animals. More recently, large-scale transcriptomic studies attempting to classify all cortical neurons by their gene expression profiles and by their morphological and electrophysiological phenotypes divided all SOM interneurons into 13 morpho-electro-transcriptomic (MET) types. It remains unclear, however, how the previously identified SOM subtypes relate to each other, and how they map onto the suggested MET classification scheme. Importantly, only a small number of Cre or Flp driver line are available to target SOM interneurons, and there are currently no genetic tools to target the majority of the proposed MET types for recording, imaging or optogenetic manipulations, severely hindering progress on understanding the roles SOM interneurons play in sensorimotor processing or in learning and memory. To begin to overcome these barriers, we undertook a systematic examination of SOM interneuron subtypes in layer 5 of mouse somatosensory cortex. We generated 4 intersectional triple-transgenic genotypes, by crossing the Sst-IRES-Flp line with 4 different Cre lines and with a dual-color reporter that labels all Cre expressing SOM cells with GFP and all other SOM cells in the same brain with tdTomato. Brains from adult mice of both sexes were retrogradely labeled by epipial dye deposits, processed histologically, and immunostained for 3 marker proteins known to be expressed in different SOM subsets. By correlating fluorescent protein expression, retrograde label and marker proteins in the same neurons, we found that Cre-expressing SOM cells in the Calb2-IRES-Cre and in the Chrna2-Cre lines, and GFP expressing neurons in the X94 line, comprise three non-overlapping SOM populations which together account for about half of all SOM cell in layer 5. Using whole-cell recordings ex-vivo, we show that they also exhibit electrophysiological properties which are distinctly different from each other. This multimodal convergence of axonal projection target, marker protein expression and electrophysiological properties strongly suggests that these three populations can be considered bona-fide SOM subtypes. Indeed, each of the three subtypes appears to map onto a unique MET type. Our findings call for a renewed effort to generate additional driver lines that can be used combinatorially to provide genetic access to the many remaining SOM subtypes and uncover their roles in cortical computations."

How specific experiences are transduced to modulate gene expression and precisely tune neuronal functions are not fully defined. Here, we describe the molecular profile of a thermosensory neuron pair inC. elegansexperiencing different temperature stimuli. We find that distinct salient features of the temperature stimulus including its duration, magnitude of change, and absolute value are encoded in the gene expression program in this single neuron, and identify a novel transmembrane protein and a transcription factor whose specific transcriptional dynamics are essential to drive neuronal, behavioral, and developmental plasticity. Expression changes are driven by broadly expressed activity-dependent transcription factors and correspondingcis-regulatory elements that nevertheless direct neuron- and stimulus-specific gene expression programs. Our results indicate that coupling of defined stimulus characteristics to the gene regulatory logic in individual specialized neuron types can customize neuronal properties to drive precise behavioral adaptation."

MALDI-TOF-MS is a rapid and cost-effective technique for multi-variant genotyping, but it is challenging to efficiently detect CNVs and clustered SNVs, especially to simultaneously detect CNVs and SNVs in one reaction. Herein, a novel strategy termed Target-Allele-Specific Probe Single-Base Extension (TASP-SBE) was devised to efficiently detect CNVs and clustered SNVs with MALDI-TOF-MS. By comprehensive use of traditional SBE and TASP-SBE strategies, a MALDI-TOF-MS assay was also developed to simultaneously detect 28 α-/β-thalassemia mutations in a single reaction system, including 4 α-thalassemia deletions, 3 HBA and 21 HBB SNVs. The results showed that all 28 mutations were sensitively identified, and the CNVs of HBA/HBB genes were also accurately analyzed based on the ratio of peak height (RPH) between the target allele and reference gene. The double-blind evaluation results of 989 thalassemia carrier samples showed a 100% concordance of this assay with other methods. In conclusion, a one-tube MALDI-TOF-MS assay was developed to simultaneously genotype 28 thalassemia mutations. This novel TASP-SBE was also verified a practicable strategy for the detection of CNVs and clustered SNVs, providing a feasible approach for multi-variants analysis with MALDI-TOF-MS technique.© 2023.

We searched the literature for pediatric applications of salivary biomarkers, more specifically, in children from 0 to 18 years old. The use of those biomarkers spans autoimmune, developmental disorders, oncology, neuropsychiatry, respiratory illnesses, gastrointestinal disorders, and oral diseases. Four major applications of salivary proteins as biomarkers are: (1) dental health (caries, stress from orthodontic appliances, and gingivitis); (2) gastrointestinal conditions (eosinophilic esophagitis, acid reflux, appendicitis); (3) metabolic conditions (obesity, diabetes); and (4) respiratory conditions (asthma, allergic rhinitis, small airway inflammation, pneumonia). Genomics, metabolomics, microbiomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics, are various other classifications for biosensing based on the type of biomarkers used and reviewed here. Lastly, we describe the recent advances in pediatric biosensing applications using saliva.

Non-Mendelian transgenerational inheritance of traits in response to environmental stimuli has been confirmed in non-mammalian organisms including plants and worms and are shown to be epigenetically mediated. However, transgenerational inheritance beyond the F2 generation remains controversial in mammals. Our lab previously discovered that the treatment of rodents (rats and mice) with folic acid significantly enhances the regeneration of injured axons following spinal cord injuryin vivoandin vitro, and the effect is mediated by DNA methylation. The potential heritability of DNA methylation prompted us to investigate the following question: Is the enhanced axonal regeneration phenotype inherited transgenerationally without exposure to folic acid supplementation in the intervening generations? In the present review, we condense our findings showing that a beneficial trait (i.e., enhanced axonal regeneration after spinal cord injury) and accompanying molecular alterations (i.e., DNA methylation), triggered by an environmental exposure (i.e., folic acid supplementation) to F0 animals only, are inherited transgenerationally and beyond the F3 generation.© The Author(s) 2023.

Evidence shows its impacts on various aspects, including epigenetics alteration. The DNA methylation patterns underlying alcohol-associated cancers are not fully understood.Methods:We investigated the aberrant DNA methylation patterns in four alcohol-associated cancers based on the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Pearson coefficient correlations were identified between differential methylated CpG probes and annotated genes. Transcriptional factor motifs were enriched and clustered using MEME Suite, and a regulatory network was constructed.Results:In each cancer, differential methylated probes (DMPs) were identified, and 172 hypermethylated and 21 hypomethylated pan-cancer DMPs (PDMPs) were examined further.

"36768610","Addressing the Reciprocal Crosstalk between the AR and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR Signaling Pathways for Prostate Cancer Treatment.","Int J Mol Sci","The reduction in androgen synthesis and the blockade of the androgen receptor (AR) function by chemical castration and AR signaling inhibitors represent the main treatment lines for the initial stages of prostate cancer. Unfortunately, resistance mechanisms ultimately develop due to alterations in the AR pathway, such as gene amplification or mutations, and also the emergence of alternative pathways that render the tumor less or, more rarely, completely independent of androgen activation. An essential oncogenic axis activated in prostate cancer is the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, as evidenced by the frequent alterations of the negative regulator phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and by the activating mutations in PI3K subunits. Additionally, crosstalk and reciprocal feedback loops between androgen signaling and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling cascade that activate pro-survival signals and play an essential role in disease recurrence and progression have been evidenced. Inhibitors addressing different players of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway have been evaluated in the clinic. Only a limited benefit has been reported in prostate cancer up to now due to the associated side effects, so novel combination approaches and biomarkers predictive of patient response are urgently needed. Here, we reviewed recent data on the crosstalk between AR signaling and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, the selective inhibitors identified, and the most advanced clinical studies, with a focus on combination treatments. A deeper understanding of the complex molecular mechanisms involved in disease progression and treatment resistance is essential to further guide therapeutic approaches with improved outcomes."
"36711980","Regulated Induced Proximity Targeting Chimeras (RIPTACs): a Novel Heterobifunctional Small Molecule Therapeutic Strategy for Killing Cancer Cells Selectively.","bioRxiv","While specific cell signaling pathway inhibitors have yielded great success in oncology, directly triggering cancer cell death is one of the great drug discovery challenges facing biomedical research in the era of precision oncology. Attempts to eradicate cancer cells expressing unique target proteins, such as antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), T-cell engaging therapies, and radiopharmaceuticals have been successful in the clinic, but they are limited by the number of targets given the inability to target intracellular proteins. More recently, heterobifunctional small molecules such as Proteolysis Targeting Chimera (PROTACs) have paved the way for protein proximity inducing therapeutic modalities. Here, we describe a proof-of-concept study using novel heterobifunctional small molecules calledRegulatedInducedProximityTargetingChimeras or RIPTACs, which elicit a stable ternary complex between a target protein selectively expressed in cancer tissue and a pan-expressed protein essential for cell survival. The resulting cooperative protein:protein interaction (PPI) abrogates the function of the essential protein, thus leading to cell death selectively in cells expressing the target protein. This approach not only opens new target space by leveraging differentially expressed intracellular proteins but also has the advantage of not requiring the target to be a driver of disease. Thus, RIPTACs can address non-target mechanisms of resistance given that cell killing is driven by inactivation of the essential protein. Using the HaloTag7-FKBP model system as a target protein, we describe RIPTACs that incorporate a covalent or non-covalent target ligand connected via a linker to effector ligands such as JQ1 (BRD4), BI2536 (PLK1), or multi-CDK inhibitors such as TMX3013 or dinaciclib. We show that these RIPTACs exhibit positive co-operativity, accumulate selectively in cells expressing HaloTag7-FKBP, form stable target:RIPTAC:effector trimers in cells, and induce an anti-proliferative response in target-expressing cells. We propose that RIPTACs are a novel heterobifunctional therapeutic modality to treat cancers that are known to selectively express a specific intracellular protein."

It is well known as one of the key elements involved in mRNA decay pathways and participates in transcript and protein quality control in several different aspects. Firstly, UPF1 specifically degrades premature termination codon (PTC)-containing products in a nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD)-coupled manner. Additionally, UPF1 can potentially act as an E3 ligase and degrade target proteins independently from mRNA decay pathways. Thus, UPF1 protects cells against the accumulation of misfolded polypeptides. However, this multitasking protein may still hide many of its functions and abilities. In this article, we summarize important discoveries in the context of UPF1, its involvement in various cellular pathways, as well as its structural importance and mutational changes related to the emergence of various pathologies and disease states. Even though the state of knowledge about this protein has significantly increased over the years, there are still many intriguing aspects that remain unresolved."
"36830584","An Isobaric Labeling Approach to Enhance Detection and Quantification of Tissue-Derived Plasma Proteins as Potential Early Disease Biomarkers.","Biomolecules","The proteomic analysis of plasma holds great promise to advance precision medicine and identify biomarkers of disease. However, it is likely that many potential biomarkers circulating in plasma originate from other tissues and are only present in low abundances in the plasma. Accurate detection and quantification of low abundance proteins by standard mass spectrometry approaches remain challenging. In addition, it is difficult to link low abundance plasma proteins back to their specific tissues or organs of origin with confidence. To address these challenges, we developed a mass spectrometry approach based on the use of tandem mass tags (TMT) and a tissue reference sample. By applying this approach to nonhuman primate plasma samples, we were able to identify and quantify 820 proteins by using a kidney tissue homogenate as reference. On average, 643 ± 16 proteins were identified per plasma sample. About 58% of proteins identified in replicate experiments were identified both times. A ratio of 50 μg kidney protein to 10 μg plasma protein, and the use of the TMT label with the highest molecular weight (131) for the kidney reference yielded the largest number of proteins in the analysis, and identified low abundance proteins in plasma that are prominently found in the kidney. Overall, this methodology promises efficient quantification of plasma proteins potentially released from specific tissues, thereby increasing the number of putative disease biomarkers for future study."

By briefly reviewing the historical and current challenges of cytogenetics, the new conceptual and technological platform of the 21st century clinical cytogenetics is presented. Particularly, the genome architecture theory (GAT) has been used as a new framework to emphasize the importance of clinical cytogenetics in the genomic era, as karyotype dynamics play a central role in information-based genomics and genome-based macroevolution. Furthermore, many diseases can be linked to elevated levels of genomic variations within a given environment. With karyotype coding in mind, new opportunities for clinical cytogenetics are discussed to integrate genomics back into cytogenetics, as karyotypic context represents a new type of genomic information that organizes gene interactions. The proposed research frontiers include: 1. focusing on karyotypic heterogeneity (e.g., classifying non-clonal chromosome aberrations (NCCAs), studying mosaicism, heteromorphism, and nuclear architecture alteration-mediated diseases), 2. monitoring the process of somatic evolution by characterizing genome instability and illustrating the relationship between stress, karyotype dynamics, and diseases, and 3. developing methods to integrate genomic data and cytogenomics. We hope that these perspectives can trigger further discussion beyond traditional chromosomal analyses. Future clinical cytogenetics should profile chromosome instability-mediated somatic evolution, as well as the degree of non-clonal chromosomal aberrations that monitor the genomic system's stress response. Using this platform, many common and complex disease conditions, including the aging process, can be effectively and tangibly monitored for health benefits."

We have combined flow cytometry and machine learning to develop a sputum-based test (CyPath Lung) that can assist physicians in decision-making in such cases.Single cell suspensions prepared from induced sputum samples collected over three consecutive days were labeled with a viability dye to exclude dead cells, antibodies to distinguish cell types, and a porphyrin to label cancer-associated cells. The labeled cell suspension was run on a flow cytometer and the data collected. An analysis pipeline combining automated flow cytometry data processing with machine learning was developed to distinguish cancer from non-cancer samples from 150 patients at high risk of whom 28 had lung cancer. Flow data and patient features were evaluated to identify predictors of lung cancer. Random training and test sets were chosen to evaluate predictive variables iteratively until a robust model was identified. The final model was tested on a second, independent group of 32 samples, including six samples from patients diagnosed with lung cancer.Automated analysis combined with machine learning resulted in a predictive model that achieved an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.89 (95% CI 0.83-0.89). The sensitivity and specificity were 82% and 88%, respectively, and the negative and positive predictive values 96% and 61%, respectively. Importantly, the test was 92% sensitive and 87% specific in cases when nodules were < 20 mm (AUC of 0.94; 95% CI 0.89-0.99). Testing of the model on an independent second set of samples showed an AUC of 0.85 (95% CI 0.71-0.98) with an 83% sensitivity, 77% specificity, 95% negative predictive value and 45% positive predictive value. The model is robust to differences in sample processing and disease state.CyPath Lung correctly classifies samples as cancer or non-cancer with high accuracy, including from participants at different disease stages and with nodules < 20 mm in diameter.

"36747817","Genome Skimming with Nanopore Sequencing Precisely Determines Global and Transposon DNA Methylation in Vertebrates.","bioRxiv","Genome skimming is defined as low-pass sequencing below 0.05X coverage and is typically used for mitochondrial genome recovery and species identification. Long read nanopore sequencers enable simultaneous reading of both DNA sequence and methylation and can multiplex samples for low-cost genome skimming. Here I present nanopore sequencing as a highly precise platform for global DNA methylation and transposon assessment. At coverage of just 0.001X, or 30 Mb of reads, accuracy is sub-1%. Biological and technical replicates validate high precision. Skimming 40 vertebrate species reveals conserved patterns of global methylation consistent with whole genome bisulfite sequencing and an average mapping rate above 97%. Genome size directly correlates to global DNA methylation, explaining 44% of its variance. Accurate SINE and LINE transposon methylation in both mouse and primates can be obtained with just 0.0001X coverage, or 3 Mb of reads. Sample multiplexing, field portability, and the low price of this instrument combine to make genome skimming for DNA methylation an accessible method for epigenetic assessment from ecology to epidemiology, and by low resource groups."
"36760994","Prospects of microgreens as budding living functional food: Breeding and biofortification through OMICS and other approaches for nutritional security.","Front Genet","Nutrient deficiency has resulted in impaired growth and development of the population globally. Microgreens are considered immature greens (required light for photosynthesis and growing medium) and developed from the seeds of vegetables, legumes, herbs, and cereals. These are considered ""living superfood/functional food"" due to the presence of chlorophyll, beta carotene, lutein, and minerals like magnesium (Mg), Potassium (K), Phosphorus (P), and Calcium (Ca). Microgreens are rich at the nutritional level and contain several phytoactive compounds (carotenoids, phenols, glucosinolates, polysterols) that are helpful for human health on Earth and in space due to their anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-carcinogenic properties. Microgreens can be used as plant-based nutritive vegetarian foods that will be fruitful as a nourishing constituent in the food industryfor garnish purposes, complement flavor, texture, and color to salads, soups, flat-breads, pizzas, and sandwiches (substitute to lettuce in tacos, sandwich, burger). Good handling practices may enhance microgreens'stability, storage, and shelf-life under appropriate conditions, including light, temperature, nutrients, humidity, and substrate. Moreover, the substrate may be a nutritive liquid solution (hydroponic system) or solid medium (coco peat, coconut fiber, coir dust and husks, sand, vermicompost, sugarcane filter cake,etc.) based on a variety of microgreens. However integrated multiomics approaches alongwith nutriomics and foodomics may be explored and utilized to identify and breed most potential microgreen genotypes, biofortify including increasing the nutritional content (macro-elements:K, Ca and Mg; oligo-elements: Fe and Zn and antioxidant activity) and microgreens related other traits viz., fast growth, good nutritional values, high germination percentage, and appropriate shelf-life through the implementation of integrated approaches includes genomics, transcriptomics, sequencing-based approaches, molecular breeding, machine learning, nanoparticles, and seed priming strategiesetc.Copyright © 2023 Gupta, Sharma, Singh, Bhardwaj, Srivastava and Kumar."
"36668670","Sequencing-based fine-mapping and in silico functional characterization of the 10q24.32 arsenic metabolism efficiency locus across multiple arsenic-exposed populations.","PLoS Genet","Inorganic arsenic is highly toxic and carcinogenic to humans. Exposed individuals vary in their ability to metabolize arsenic, and variability in arsenic metabolism efficiency (AME) is associated with risks of arsenic-related toxicities. Inherited genetic variation in the 10q24.32 region, near the arsenic methyltransferase (AS3MT) gene, is associated with urine-based measures of AME in multiple arsenic-exposed populations. To identify potential causal variants in this region, we applied fine mapping approaches to targeted sequencing data generated for exposed individuals from Bangladeshi, American Indian, and European American populations (n = 2,357, 557, and 648 respectively). We identified three independent association signals for Bangladeshis, two for American Indians, and one for European Americans. The size of the confidence sets for each signal varied from 4 to 85 variants. There was one signal shared across all three populations, represented by the same SNP in American Indians and European Americans (rs191177668) and in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with a lead SNP in Bangladesh (rs145537350). Beyond this shared signal, differences in LD patterns, minor allele frequency (MAF) (e.g., rs12573221 ~13% in Bangladesh ~0.2% among American Indians), and/or heterogeneity in effect sizes across populations likely contributed to the apparent population specificity of the additional identified signals. One of our potential causal variants influences AS3MT expression and nearby DNA methylation in numerous GTEx tissue types (with rs4919690 as a likely causal variant). Several SNPs in our confidence sets overlap transcription factor binding sites and cis-regulatory elements (from ENCODE). Taken together, our analyses reveal multiple potential causal variants in the 10q24.32 region influencing AME, including a variant shared across populations, and elucidate potential biological mechanisms underlying the impact of genetic variation on AME.Copyright: © 2023 Chernoff et al.

"36866046","DeepBend: An interpretable model of DNA bendability.","iScience","The bendability of genomic DNA impacts chromatin packaging and protein-DNA binding. However, we do not have a comprehensive understanding of the motifs influencing DNA bendability. Recent high-throughput technologies such as Loop-Seq offer an opportunity to address this gap but the lack of accurate and interpretable machine learning models still remains. Here we introduce DeepBend, a convolutional neural network model with convolutions designed to directly capture the motifs underlying DNA bendability and their periodic occurrences or relative arrangements that modulate bendability. DeepBend consistently performs on par with alternative models while giving an extra edge through mechanistic interpretations. Besides confirming the known motifs of DNA bendability, DeepBend also revealed several novel motifs and showed how the spatial patterns of motif occurrences influence bendability. DeepBend's genome-wide prediction of bendability further showed how bendability is linked to chromatin conformation and revealed the motifs controlling the bendability of topologically associated domains and their boundaries.© 2023 The Authors."
"36800973","The Matthews correlation coefficientÂ (MCC) should replace the ROCÂ AUC as the standard metric for assessing binary classification.","BioData Min","Binary classification is a common task for which machine learning and computational statistics are used, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) has become the common standard metric to evaluate binary classifications in most scientific fields. The ROC curve has true positive rate (also called sensitivity or recall) on the y axis and false positive rate on the x axis, and the ROC AUC can range from 0 (worst result) to 1 (perfect result). The ROC AUC, however, has several flaws and drawbacks. This score is generated including predictions that obtained insufficient sensitivity and specificity, and moreover it does not say anything about positive predictive value (also known as precision) nor negative predictive value (NPV) obtained by the classifier, therefore potentially generating inflated overoptimistic results. Since it is common to include ROC AUC alone without precision and negative predictive value, a researcher might erroneously conclude that their classification was successful. Furthermore, a given point in the ROC space does not identify a single confusion matrix nor a group of matrices sharing the same MCC value. Indeed, a given (sensitivity, specificity) pair can cover a broad MCC range, which casts doubts on the reliability of ROC AUC as a performance measure. In contrast, the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) generates a high score in its [Formula: see text] interval only if the classifier scored a high value for all the four basic rates of the confusion matrix: sensitivity, specificity, precision, and negative predictive value. A high MCC (for example, MCC [Formula: see text] 0.9), moreover, always corresponds to a high ROC AUC, and not vice versa. In this short study, we explain why the Matthews correlation coefficient should replace the ROC AUC as standard statistic in all the scientific studies involving a binary classification, in all scientific fields.© 2023.

"36736292","Using genetic association data to guide drug discovery and development: Review of methods and applications.","Am J Hum Genet","Evidence on the validity of drug targets from randomized trials is reliable but typically expensive and slow to obtain. In contrast, evidence from conventional observational epidemiological studies is less reliable because of the potential for bias from confounding and reverse causation. Mendelian randomization is a quasi-experimental approach analogous to a randomized trial that exploits naturally occurring randomization in the transmission of genetic variants. In Mendelian randomization, genetic variants that can be regarded as proxies for an intervention on the proposed drug target are leveraged as instrumental variables to investigate potential effects on biomarkers and disease outcomes in large-scale observational datasets. This approach can be implemented rapidly for a range of drug targets to provide evidence on their effects and thus inform on their priority for further investigation. In this review, we present statistical methods and their applications to showcase the diverse opportunities for applying Mendelian randomization in guiding clinical development efforts, thus enabling interventions to target the right mechanism in the right population group at the right time. These methods can inform investigators on the mechanisms underlying drug effects, their related biomarkers, implications for the timing of interventions, and the population subgroups that stand to gain the most benefit. Most methods can be implemented with publicly available data on summarized genetic associations with traits and diseases, meaning that the only major limitations to their usage are the availability of appropriately powered studies for the exposure and outcome and the existence of a suitable genetic proxy for the proposed intervention.Copyright © 2022 American Society of Human Genetics.

"36705323","Phenome-wide Mendelian randomisation analysis identifies causal factors for age-related macular degeneration.","Elife","Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of blindness in the industrialised world and is projected to affect >280 million people worldwide by 2040. Aiming to identify causal factors and potential therapeutic targets for this common condition, we designed and undertook a phenome-wide Mendelian randomisation (MR) study.We evaluated the effect of 4591 exposure traits on early AMD using univariable MR. Statistically significant results were explored further using: validation in an advanced AMD cohort; MR Bayesian model averaging (MR-BMA); and multivariable MR.Overall, 44 traits were found to be putatively causal for early AMD in univariable analysis. Serum proteins that were found to have significant relationships with AMD included S100-A5 (odds ratio [OR] = 1.07, p-value = 6.80E-06), cathepsin F (OR = 1.10, p-value = 7.16E-05), and serine palmitoyltransferase 2 (OR = 0.86, p-value = 1.00E-03). Univariable MR analysis also supported roles for complement and immune cell traits. Although numerous lipid traits were found to be significantly related to AMD, MR-BMA suggested a driving causal role for serum sphingomyelin (marginal inclusion probability [MIP] = 0.76; model-averaged causal estimate [MACE] = 0.29).The results of this MR study support several putative causal factors for AMD and highlight avenues for future translational research.This project was funded by the Wellcome Trust (224643/Z/21/Z; 200990/Z/16/Z); the University of Manchester's Wellcome Institutional Strategic Support Fund (Wellcome ISSF) grant (204796/Z/16/Z); the UK National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Academic Clinical Fellow and Clinical Lecturer Programmes; Retina UK and Fight for Sight (GR586); the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) (1150144).© 2023, Julian et al."
"36670186","Biomedical consequences of elevated cholesterol-containing lipoproteins and apolipoproteins on cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular outcomes.","Commun Med (Lond)","Higher concentrations of cholesterol-containing low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C) increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The association of LDL-C with non-CVD traits remains unclear, as are the possible independent contributions of other cholesterol-containing lipoproteins and apolipoproteins.Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to measure the cholesterol content of high density (HDL-C), very low-density (VLDL-C), intermediate-density (IDL-C), as well as low-density lipoprotein fractions, the apolipoproteins Apo-A1 and Apo-B, as well as total triglycerides (TG), remnant-cholesterol (Rem-Chol) and total cholesterol (TC). The causal effects of these exposures were assessed against 33 outcomes using univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization (MR).The majority of cholesterol containing lipoproteins and apolipoproteins affect coronary heart disease (CHD), carotid intima-media thickness, carotid plaque, C-reactive protein (CRP) and blood pressure. Multivariable MR indicated that many of these effects act independently of HDL-C, LDL-C and TG, the most frequently measured lipid fractions. Higher concentrations of TG, VLDL-C, Rem-Chol and Apo-B increased heart failure (HF) risk; often independently of LDL-C, HDL-C or TG. Finally, a subset of these exposures associated with non-CVD traits such as Alzheimer's disease (AD: HDL-C, LDL-C, IDL-C, Apo-B), type 2 diabetes (T2DM: VLDL-C, IDL-C, LDL-C), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD: LDL-C, IDL-C).The cholesterol content of a wide range of lipoprotein and apolipoproteins associate with measures of atherosclerosis, blood pressure, CRP, and CHD, with a subset affecting HF, T2DM, AD and IBD risk. Many of the observed effects appear to act independently of LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG, supporting the targeting of lipid fractions beyond LDL-C for disease prevention.© 2023. The Author(s)."
