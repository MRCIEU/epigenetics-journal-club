No,20230309,dnamage,Interest,36824863,Gene body DNA hydroxymethylation restricts the magnitude of transcriptional changes during aging.,bioRxiv,"DNA hydroxymethylation (5hmC) is the most abundant oxidative derivative of DNA methylation (5mC) and is typically enriched at enhancers and gene bodies of transcriptionally active and tissue-specific genes. Although aberrant genomic 5hmC has been implicated in many age-related diseases, the functional role of the modification in aging remains largely unknown. Here, we report that 5hmC is stably enriched in multiple aged organs. Using the liver and cerebellum as model organs, we show that 5hmC accumulates in gene bodies associated with tissue-specific function and thereby restricts the magnitude of gene expression changes during aging. Mechanistically, we found that 5hmC decreases binding affinity of splicing factors compared to unmodified cytosine and 5mC, and is correlated with age-related alternative splicing events, suggesting RNA splicing as a potential mediator of 5hmCâ€™s transcriptionally restrictive function. Furthermore, we show that various age-related contexts, such as prolonged quiescence and senescence, are partially responsible for driving the accumulation of 5hmC with age. We provide evidence that this age-related function is conserved in mouse and human tissues, and further show that the modification is altered by regimens known to modulate lifespan. Our findings reveal that 5hmC is a regulator of tissue-specific function and may play a role in regulating longevity."
No,20230309,review,Interest,36658435,The Singapore National Precision Medicine Strategy.,Nat Genet,"Precision medicine promises to transform healthcare for groups and individuals through early disease detection, refining diagnoses and tailoring treatments. Analysis of large-scale genomic-phenotypic databases is a critical enabler of precision medicine. Although Asia is home to 60% of the world's population, many Asian ancestries are under-represented in existing databases, leading to missed opportunities for new discoveries, particularly for diseases most relevant for these populations. The Singapore National Precision Medicine initiative is a whole-of-government 10-year initiative aiming to generate precision medicine data of up to one million individuals, integrating genomic, lifestyle, health, social and environmental data. Beyond technologies, routine adoption of precision medicine in clinical practice requires social, ethical, legal and regulatory barriers to be addressed. Identifying driver use cases in which precision medicine results in standardized changes to clinical workflows or improvements in population health, coupled with health economic analysis to demonstrate value-based healthcare, is a vital prerequisite for responsible health system adoption.© 2023.

Yes,20230309,dnamage,Matt,36855161,Refining epigenetic prediction of chronological and biological age.,Genome Med,"Epigenetic clocks can track both chronological age (cAge) and biological age (bAge). The latter is typically defined by physiological biomarkers and risk of adverse health outcomes, including all-cause mortality. As cohort sample sizes increase, estimates of cAge and bAge become more precise. Here, we aim to develop accurate epigenetic predictors of cAge and bAge, whilst improving our understanding of their epigenomic architecture.First, we perform large-scale (N = 18,413) epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of chronological age and all-cause mortality. Next, to create a cAge predictor, we use methylation data from 24,674 participants from the Generation Scotland study, the Lothian Birth Cohorts (LBC) of 1921 and 1936, and 8 other cohorts with publicly available data. In addition, we train a predictor of time to all-cause mortality as a proxy for bAge using the Generation Scotland cohort (1214 observed deaths). For this purpose, we use epigenetic surrogates (EpiScores) for 109 plasma proteins and the 8 component parts of GrimAge, one of the current best epigenetic predictors of survival. We test this bAge predictor in four external cohorts (LBC1921, LBC1936, the Framingham Heart Study and the Women's Health Initiative study).Through the inclusion of linear and non-linear age-CpG associations from the EWAS, feature pre-selection in advance of elastic net regression, and a leave-one-cohort-out (LOCO) cross-validation framework, we obtain cAge prediction with a median absolute error equal to 2.3 years. Our bAge predictor was found to slightly outperform GrimAge in terms of the strength of its association to survival (HRGrimAge = 1.47 [1.40, 1.54] with p = 1.08 × 10-52, and HRbAge = 1.52 [1.44, 1.59] with p = 2.20 × 10-60). Finally, we introduce MethylBrowsR, an online tool to visualise epigenome-wide CpG-age associations.The integration of multiple large datasets, EpiScores, non-linear DNAm effects, and new approaches to feature selection has facilitated improvements to the blood-based epigenetic prediction of biological and chronological age.© 2023.

No,20230309,circadian rhythm,Matt,36745672,Day-night and seasonal variation of human gene expression across tissues.,PLoS Biol,"Circadian and circannual cycles trigger physiological changes whose reflection on human transcriptomes remains largely uncharted. We used the time and season of death of 932 individuals from GTEx to jointly investigate transcriptomic changes associated with those cycles across multiple tissues. Overall, most variation across tissues during day-night and among seasons was unique to each cycle. Although all tissues remodeled their transcriptomes, brain and gonadal tissues exhibited the highest seasonality, whereas those in the thoracic cavity showed stronger day-night regulation. Core clock genes displayed marked day-night differences across multiple tissues, which were largely conserved in baboon and mouse, but adapted to their nocturnal or diurnal habits. Seasonal variation of expression affected multiple pathways, and it was enriched among genes associated with the immune response, consistent with the seasonality of viral infections. Furthermore, they unveiled cytoarchitectural changes in brain regions. Altogether, our results provide the first combined atlas of how transcriptomes from human tissues adapt to major cycling environmental conditions. This atlas may have multiple applications; for example, drug targets with day-night or seasonal variation in gene expression may benefit from temporally adjusted doses.Copyright: © 2023 Wucher et al.

We have discovered that every circadian clock-controlled output gene (CCG), but not the core clock nor its immediate-output genes, contains a single cognate intronic deoxyCpG-rich island, the demethylation-methylation of which is controlled by the CC. During the transcriptional activation period, these intronic islands are demethylated and, upon dimerization of two YY1 protein binding sites located upstream to the transcriptional enhancer and downstream from the deoxyCpG-rich island, store activating components initially assembled on a cognate active enhancer (a RORE, a D-box or an E-box), in keeping with the generation of a transcriptionally active condensate that boosts the initiation of transcription of their cognate pre-mRNAs. We report how these single intronic deoxyCpG-rich islands are instrumental in such a circadian activation/repression transcriptional process."

For most important class of drug targets, genetic evidence needs to be generalizable to diverse populations. Given that the majority of the previous studies were conducted in European ancestry populations, little is known about the protein-associated genetic variants in East Asians. Based on data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry technique, we conduct genome-wide association analyses for 304 unique proteins in 2,958 Han Chinese participants. We identify 195 genetic variant-protein associations. Colocalization and Mendelian randomization analyses highlight 60 gene-protein-phenotype associations, 45 of which (75%) have not been prioritized in Europeans previously. Further cross-ancestry analyses uncover key proteins that contributed to the differences in the obesity-induced diabetes and coronary artery disease susceptibility. These findings provide novel druggable proteins as well as a unique resource for the trans-ancestry evaluation of protein-targeted drug discovery.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Here, we conducted a cis-focused proteogenomic analysis of 2,923 plasma proteins measured in 1,180 individuals using antibody-based assays. We (1) identify 256 unreported protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL); (2) demonstrate shared genetic regulation of 224 cis-pQTLs with 575 specific health outcomes, revealing examples for notable metabolic diseases (such as gastrin-releasing peptide as a potential therapeutic target for type 2 diabetes); (3) improve causal gene assignment at 40% (n = 192) of overlapping risk loci; and (4) observe convergence of phenotypic consequences of cis-pQTLs and rare loss-of-function gene burden for 12 proteins, such as TIMD4 for lipoprotein metabolism. Our findings demonstrate the value of integrating complementary proteomic technologies with genomics even at moderate scale to identify new mediators of metabolic diseases with the potential for therapeutic interventions."

Existing phenotype subtyping methods primarily rely on clinically observed heterogeneity or metadata clustering. However, they generally tend to capture the dominant sources of variation in the data, which often originate from variation that is not descriptive of the mechanistic heterogeneity of the phenotype of interest; in fact, such dominant sources of variation, such as population structure or technical variation, are, in general, expected to be independent of subphenotypic structure. We instead aim to find a subspace with signal that is unique to a group of samples for which we believe that subphenotypic variation exists (e.g., cases of a disease). To that end, we introduce Phenotype Aware Components Analysis (PACA), a contrastive learning approach leveraging canonical correlation analysis to robustly capture weak sources of subphenotypic variation. In the context of disease, PACA learns a gradient of variation unique to cases in a given dataset, while leveraging control samples for accounting for variation and imbalances of biological and technical confounders between cases and controls. We evaluated PACA using an extensive simulation study, as well as on various subtyping tasks using genotypes, transcriptomics, and DNA methylation data. Our results provide multiple strong evidence that PACA allows us to robustly capture weak unknown variation of interest while being calibrated and well-powered, far superseding the performance of alternative methods. This renders PACA as a state-of-the-art tool for definingde novosubtypes that are more likely to reflect molecular heterogeneity, especially in challenging cases where the phenotypic heterogeneity may be masked by a myriad of strong unrelated effects in the data.PACA is available as an open source R package on GitHub: https://github.com/Adigorla/PACA."
No,20230309,prediction,Ryan,36852276,Association between biological aging and lung cancer risk: Cohort study and Mendelian randomization analysis.,iScience,"Chronological age only represents the passage of time, whereas biological age reflects the physiology states and the susceptibility to morbidity and mortality. The association between biological age and lung cancer risk remains controversial. Hence, we conducted a prospective analysis in the UK Biobank study and two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis to investigate this association. Biological aging was evaluated by PhenoAgeAccel, derived from routine clinical biomarkers. Independent of chronological age, PhenoAgeAccel was positively associated with the risk of overall and histological subtypes of lung cancer. There was a joint effect of PhenoAgeAccel and genetics in lung cancer incidence. In Mendelian randomization analysis, the genetically predicted PhenoAgeAccel was associated with the increased risk of overall lung cancer, small cell, and squamous cell carcinoma. Our findings suggest PhenoAgeAccel is an independent risk factor for lung cancer, which could be incorporated with polygenic risk score to identify high-risk individuals for lung cancer.© 2023 The Authors."
No,20230309,dnamage,Sarah,36759656,A new blood based epigenetic age predictor for adolescents and young adults.,Sci Rep,"Children have special rights for protection compared to adults in our society. However, more than 1/4 of children globally have no documentation of their date of birth. Hence, there is a pressing need to develop biological methods for chronological age prediction, robust to differences in genetics, psychosocial events and physical living conditions. At present, DNA methylation is the most promising biological biomarker applied for age assessment. The human genome contains around 28 million DNA methylation sites, many of which change with age. Several epigenetic clocks accurately predict chronological age using methylation levels at age associated GpG-sites. However, variation in DNA methylation increases with age, and there is no epigenetic clock specifically designed for adolescents and young adults. Here we present a novel age Predictor for Adolescents and Young Adults (PAYA), using 267 CpG methylation sites to assess the chronological age of adolescents and young adults. We compared different preprocessing approaches and investigated the effect on prediction performance of the epigenetic clock. We evaluated performance using an independent validation data set consisting of 18-year-old individuals, where we obtained a median absolute deviation of just below 0.7 years. This tool may be helpful in age assessment of adolescents and young adults. However, there is a need to investigate the robustness of the age predictor across geographical and disease populations as well as environmental effects.© 2023. The Author(s)."

These data can be used to better characterize the molecular features associated with clinical outcomes and to test hypotheses across multiple, independent patient cohorts. In addition, derived features, such as estimates of cell composition, risk scores, and androgen receptor (AR) scores, can be used to develop novel hypotheses leveraging existing multi-omic datasets. The full potential of such data is yet to be realized as independent datasets exist in different repositories, have been processed using different pipelines, and derived and clinical features are often not provided or unstandardized.

The high incidence and mortality of breast cancer calls for improved prevention, diagnostics, and treatment, including identification of new prognostic and predictive biomarkers for use in precision medicine.With the aim of compiling a cohort amenable to integrative study designs, we collected detailed epidemiological and clinical data, blood samples, and tumor tissue from a subset of participants from the prospective, population-based Norwegian Women and Cancer (NOWAC) study. These study participants were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in North Norway before 2013 according to the Cancer Registry of Norway and constitute the Clinical and Multi-omic (CAMO) cohort. Prospectively collected questionnaire data on lifestyle and reproductive factors and blood samples were extracted from the NOWAC study, clinical and histopathological data were manually curated from medical records, and archived tumor tissue collected.The lifestyle and reproductive characteristics of the study participants in the CAMO cohort (n = 388) were largely similar to those of the breast cancer patients in NOWAC (n = 10 356). The majority of the cancers in the CAMO cohort were tumor grade 2 and of the luminal A subtype. Approx. 80% were estrogen receptor positive, 13% were HER2 positive, and 12% were triple negative breast cancers. Lymph node metastases were present in 31% at diagnosis. The epidemiological dataset in the CAMO cohort is complemented by mRNA, miRNA, and metabolomics analyses in plasma, as well as miRNA profiling in tumor tissue. Additionally, histological analyses at the level of proteins and miRNAs in tumor tissue are currently ongoing.The CAMO cohort provides data suitable for epidemiological, clinical, molecular, and multi-omics investigations, thereby enabling a systems epidemiology approach to translational breast cancer research.Copyright: © 2023 Delgado et al.

We aimed to detect DNA methylation (DNAm) variants potentially related to systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by conducting epigenome-wide association studies in 60 and 59 Chinese monozygotic twin pairs, respectively.Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling in whole blood of twins was performed using Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing, yielding 551,447 raw CpGs. Association between DNAm of single CpG and blood pressure was tested by applying generalized estimation equation. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified by comb-P approach. Inference about Causation through Examination of Familial Confounding was utilized to perform the causal inference. Ontology enrichment analysis was performed using Genomic Regions Enrichment of Annotations Tool. Candidate CpGs were quantified using Sequenom MassARRAY platform in a community population. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was conducted using gene expression data.The median age of twins was 52 years (95% range 40, 66). For SBP, 31 top CpGs (p < 1 × 10-4) and 8 DMRs were identified, with several DMRs within NFATC1, CADM2, IRX1, COL5A1, and LRAT. For DBP, 43 top CpGs (p < 1 × 10-4) and 12 DMRs were identified, with several DMRs within WNT3A, CNOT10, and DAB2IP. Important pathways, such as Notch signaling pathway, p53 pathway by glucose deprivation, and Wnt signaling pathway, were significantly enriched for SBP and DBP. Causal inference analysis suggested that DNAm at top CpGs within NDE1, MYH11, SRRM1P2, and SMPD4 influenced SBP, while SBP influenced DNAm at CpGs within TNK2. DNAm at top CpGs within WNT3A influenced DBP, while DBP influenced DNAm at CpGs within GNA14. Three CpGs mapped to WNT3A and one CpG mapped to COL5A1 were validated in a community population, with a hypermethylated and hypomethylated direction in hypertension cases, respectively. Gene expression analysis by WGCNA further identified some common genes and enrichment terms.We detect many DNAm variants that may be associated with blood pressure in whole blood, particularly the loci within WNT3A and COL5A1.

Here, we performed EWAS analysis with longitudinally collected blood lipid data from survivors in the St. Jude lifetime cohort study.Among 2052 childhood cancer survivors of European ancestry (EA) and 370 survivors of African ancestry (AA), four types of blood lipids, including high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), total cholesterol (TC), and triglycerides (TG), were measured during follow-up beyond 5-years from childhood cancer diagnosis. For the exposure EWAS (i.e., lipids measured before blood draw for DNAm), the DNAm level was an outcome variable and each of the blood lipid level was an exposure variable; vice versa for the outcome EWAS (i.e., lipids measured after blood draw for DNAm).Among EA survivors, we identified 43 lipid-associated CpGs in the HDL (n = 7), TC (n = 3), and TG (n = 33) exposure EWAS, and 106 lipid-associated CpGs in the HDL (n = 5), LDL (n = 3), TC (n = 4), and TG (n = 94) outcome EWAS. Among AA survivors, we identified 15 lipid-associated CpGs in TG exposure (n = 6), HDL (n = 1), LDL (n = 1), TG (n = 5) and TC (n = 2) outcome EWAS with epigenome-wide significance (P < 9 × 10-8). There were no overlapping lipids-associated CpGs between exposure and outcome EWAS among EA and AA survivors, suggesting that the DNAm changes of different CpGs could be the cause or consequence of blood lipid levels. In the meta-EWAS, 12 additional CpGs reached epigenome-wide significance. Notably, 32 out of 74 lipid-associated CpGs showed substantial heterogeneity (Phet < 0.1 or I2 > 70%) between EA and AA survivors, highlighting differences in DNAm markers of blood lipids between populations with diverse genetic ancestry. Ten lipid-associated CpGs were cis-expression quantitative trait methylation with their DNAm levels associated with the expression of corresponding genes, out of which seven were negatively associated.We identified distinct signatures of DNAm for blood lipids as exposures or outcomes and between EA and AA survivors, revealing additional genes involved in lipid metabolism and potential novel targets for controlling blood lipids in childhood cancer survivors.© 2023.

Epigenetic modification, particularly DNA methylation (DNAm), may explain this link. In this study, we employed three high-dimensional mediation analysis methods (HIMA, DACT, and gHMA) followed by causal mediation analysis to identify differentially methylated CpG sites and genes that mediate the association between indoor air pollution and neurodevelopmental delay. Analyses were performed using data from 142 mother to child pairs from a South African birth cohort, the Drakenstein Child Health Study. DNAm from cord blood was measured using the Infinium MethylationEPIC and HumanMethylation450 arrays. Neurodevelopment was assessed at age 2 years using the Bayley Scores of Infant and Toddler Development, 3rd edition across four domains (cognitive development, general adaptive behavior, language, and motor function). Particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 μm or less (PM10) was measured inside participants' homes during the second trimester of pregnancy.A total of 29 CpG sites and 4 genes (GOPC, RP11-74K11.1, DYRK1A, RNMT) were identified as significant mediators of the association between PM10and cognitive neurodevelopment. The estimated proportion mediated (95%-confidence interval) ranged from 0.29 [0.01, 0.86] for cg00694520 to 0.54 [0.11, 1.56] for cg05023582.Our findings suggest that DNAm may mediate the association between prenatal PM10exposure and cognitive neurodevelopment. DYRK1A and several genes that our CpG sites mapped to, including CNKSR1, IPO13, IFNGR1, LONP2, and CDH1, are associated with biological pathways implicated in cognitive neurodevelopment and three of our identified CpG sites (cg23560546 [DAPL1], cg22572779 [C6orf218], cg15000966 [NT5C]) have been previously associated with fetal brain development.

No,20230309,proxy,,36712110,Measuring the long arm of childhood in real-time: Epigenetic predictors of BMI and social determinants of health across childhood and adolescence.,bioRxiv,"Children who are socioeconomically disadvantaged are at increased risk for high body mass index (BMI) and multiple diseases in adulthood. The developmental origins of health and disease hypothesis proposes that early life conditions affect later-life health in a manner that is only partially modifiable by later-life experiences. Epigenetic mechanisms may regulate the influence of early life conditions on later life health. Recent epigenetic studies of adult blood samples have identified DNA-methylation sites associated with higher BMI and worse health (epigenetic-BMI). Here, we used longitudinal and twin study designs to examine whether epigenetic predictors of BMI developed in adults are valid biomarkers of child BMI and are sensitive to early life social determinants of health. Salivary epigenetic-BMI was calculated from two samples: (1) N=1,183 8-to-19-year-olds (609 female,meanage=13.4) from the Texas Twin Project (TTP), and (2) N=2,020 children (1,011 female) measured at 9 and 15 years from the Future of Families and Child Well-Being Study (FFCWS). We found that salivary epigenetic-BMI is robustly associated with childrenâ€™s BMI (r=0.36 tor=0.50). Longitudinal analysis suggested that epigenetic-BMI is highly stable across adolescence, but remains both a leading and lagging indicator of BMI change. Twin analyses showed that epigenetic-BMI captures differences in BMI between monozygotic twins. Moreover, children from more disadvantaged socioeconomic status (SES) and marginalized race/ethnic groups had higher epigenetic-BMI, even when controlling for concurrent BMI, pubertal development, and tobacco exposure. SES at birth relative to concurrent SES best predicted epigenetic-BMI in childhood and adolescence. We show for the first time that epigenetic predictors of BMI calculated from pediatric saliva samples are valid biomarkers of childhood BMI that are sensitive to social inequalities. Our findings are in line with the hypothesis that early life conditions are especially important factors in epigenetic regulation of later life health. Research showing that health later in life is linked to early life conditions have important implications for the development of early-life interventions that could significantly extend healthy life span."

Here, we report meta-analysed sex-specific associations between gestational age and placental DNA methylation from four cohorts in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) Programme (355 females/419 males, gestational ages 23-42 weeks). We identified 407 cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpGs) in females and 794 in males where placental methylation levels were associated with gestational age. After cell-type adjustment, 55 CpGs in females and 826 in males were significant. These were enriched for biological processes critical to the immune system in females and transmembrane transport in males. Our findings are distinct between the sexes: in females, associations with gestational age are largely explained by differences in placental cellular composition, whereas in males, gestational age is directly associated with numerous alterations in methylation levels."

A subset of X-linked genes escape XCI, but the extent to which this phenomenon occurs and how it varies across tissues and in a population is as yet unclear. To characterize incidence and variability of escape across individuals and tissues, we conducted a transcriptomic study of escape in adipose, skin, lymphoblastoid cell lines and immune cells in 248 healthy individuals exhibiting skewed XCI. We quantify XCI escape from a linear model of genes' allelic fold-change and XIST-based degree of XCI skewing. We identify 62 genes, including 19 lncRNAs, with previously unknown patterns of escape. We find a range of tissue-specificity, with 11% of genes escaping XCI constitutively across tissues and 23% demonstrating tissue-restricted escape, including cell type-specific escape across immune cells of the same individual. We also detect substantial inter-individual variability in escape. Monozygotic twins share more similar escape than dizygotic twins, indicating that genetic factors may underlie inter-individual differences in escape. However, discordant escape also occurs within monozygotic co-twins, suggesting environmental factors also influence escape. Altogether, these data indicate that XCI escape is an under-appreciated source of transcriptional differences, and an intricate phenotype impacting variable trait expressivity in females.Copyright: © 2023 Zito et al.

No,20230309,gwas,,36798175,Identification and analysis of individuals who deviate from their genetically-predicted phenotype.,bioRxiv,"Findings from genome-wide association studies have facilitated the generation of genetic predictors for many common human phenotypes. Stratifying individuals misaligned to a genetic predictor based on common variants may be important for follow-up studies that aim to identify alternative causal factors. Using genome-wide imputed genetic data, we aimed to classify 158,951 unrelated individuals from the UK Biobank as either concordant or deviating from two well-measured phenotypes. We first applied our methods to standing height: our primary analysis classified 244 individuals (0.15%) as misaligned to their genetically predicted height. We show that these individuals are enriched for self-reporting being shorter or taller than average at age 10, diagnosed congenital malformations, and rare loss-of-function variants in genes previously catalogued as causal for growth disorders. Secondly, we apply our methods to LDL cholesterol. We classified 156 (0.12%) individuals as misaligned to their genetically predicted LDL cholesterol and show that these individuals were enriched for both clinically actionable cardiovascular risk factors and rare genetic variants in genes previously shown to be involved in metabolic processes. Individuals whose LDL-C was higher than expected based on the genetic predictor were also at higher risk of developing coronary artery disease and type-two diabetes, even after adjustment for measured LDL-C, BMI and age, suggesting upward deviation from genetically predicted LDL-C is indicative of generally poor health. Our results remained broadly consistent when performing sensitivity analysis based on a variety of parametric and non-parametric methods to define individuals deviating from polygenic expectation. Our analyses demonstrate the potential importance of quantitatively identifying individuals for further follow-up based on deviation from genetic predictions.Human genetics is becoming increasingly useful to help predict human traits across a population owing to findings from large-scale genetic association studies and advances in the power of genetic predictors. This provides an opportunity to potentially identify individuals that deviate from genetic predictions for a common phenotype under investigation. For example, an individual may be genetically predicted to be tall, but be shorter than expected. It is potentially important to identify individuals who deviate from genetic predictions as this can facilitate further follow-up to assess likely causes. Using 158,951 unrelated individuals from the UK Biobank, with height and LDL cholesterol, as exemplar traits, we demonstrate that approximately 0.15% & 0.12% of individuals deviate from their genetically predicted phenotypes respectively. We observed these individuals to be enriched for a range of rare clinical diagnoses, as well as rare genetic factors that may be causal. Our analyses also demonstrate several methods for detecting individuals who deviate from genetic predictions that can be applied to a range of continuous human phenotypes."

Childhood asthma is one of the commonest chronic medical illnesses in the USA which places a significant burden on the health-care system. We recently demonstrated a negative association between the duration of epidural anesthesia and the development of childhood asthma; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms still remain unclear. In this study of 127 mother-child pairs comprised of 75 Non-Hispanic Black (NHB) and 52 Non-Hispanic White (NHW) from the Newborn Epigenetic Study, we tested the hypothesis that umbilical cord blood DNA methylation mediates the association between the duration of exposure to epidural anesthesia at delivery and the development of childhood asthma and whether this differed by race/ethnicity. In the mother-child pairs of NHB ancestry, the duration of exposure to epidural anesthesia was associated with a marginally lower risk of asthma (odds ratio = 0.88, 95% confidence interval = 0.76-1.01) for each 1-h increase in exposure to epidural anesthesia. Of the 20 CpGs in the NHB population showing the strongest mediation effect, 50% demonstrated an average mediation proportion of 52%, with directional consistency of direct and indirect effects. These top 20 CpGs mapped to 21 genes enriched for pathways engaged in antigen processing, antigen presentation, protein ubiquitination and regulatory networks related to the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I complex and Nuclear Factor Kappa-B (NFkB) complex. Our findings suggest that DNA methylation in immune-related pathways contributes to the effects of the duration of exposure to epidural anesthesia on childhood asthma risk in NHB offspring.© The Author(s) 2023.

No,20230309,methods,,36699372,reComBat: batch-effect removal in large-scale multi-source gene-expression data integration.,Bioinform Adv,"With the steadily increasing abundance of omics data produced all over the world under vastly different experimental conditions residing in public databases, a crucial step in many data-driven bioinformatics applications is that of data integration. The challenge of batch-effect removal for entire databases lies in the large number of batches and biological variation, which can result in design matrix singularity. This problem can currently not be solved satisfactorily by any common batch-correction algorithm.We presentreComBat, a regularized version of the empirical Bayes method to overcome this limitation and benchmark it against popular approaches for the harmonization of public gene-expression data (both microarray and bulkRNAsq) of the human opportunistic pathogenPseudomonas aeruginosa. Batch-effects are successfully mitigated while biologically meaningful gene-expression variation is retained.reComBatfills the gap in batch-correction approaches applicable to large-scale, public omics databases and opens up new avenues for data-driven analysis of complex biological processes beyond the scope of a single study.The code is available at https://github.com/BorgwardtLab/reComBat, all data and evaluation code can be found at https://github.com/BorgwardtLab/batchCorrectionPublicData.Supplementary data are available atBioinformatics Advancesonline.© The Author(s) 2022.

No,20230309,aging,,36658433,Genome-wide RNA polymerase stalling shapes the transcriptome during aging.,Nat Genet,"Gene expression profiling has identified numerous processes altered in aging, but how these changes arise is largely unknown. Here we combined nascent RNA sequencing and RNA polymerase II chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing to elucidate the underlying mechanisms triggering gene expression changes in wild-type aged mice. We found that in 2-year-old liver, 40% of elongating RNA polymerases are stalled, lowering productive transcription and skewing transcriptional output in a gene-length-dependent fashion. We demonstrate that this transcriptional stress is caused by endogenous DNA damage and explains the majority of gene expression changes in aging in most mainly postmitotic organs, specifically affecting aging hallmark pathways such as nutrient sensing, autophagy, proteostasis, energy metabolism, immune function and cellular stress resilience. Age-related transcriptional stress is evolutionary conserved from nematodes to humans. Thus, accumulation of stochastic endogenous DNA damage during aging deteriorates basal transcription, which establishes the age-related transcriptome and causes dysfunction of key aging hallmark pathways, disclosing how DNA damage functionally underlies major aspects of normal aging.© 2023.
