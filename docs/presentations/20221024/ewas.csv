exposure,adults,36246163,Epigenet Insights,psychosocial stress,blood,228 African American mothers,null,Stress Overload and DNA Methylation in African American Women in the Intergenerational Impact of Genetic and Psychological Factors on Blood Pressure Study.,"Experiencing psychosocial stress is associated with poor health outcomes such as hypertension and obesity, which are risk factors for developing cardiovascular disease. African American women experience disproportionate risk for cardiovascular disease including exposure to high levels of psychosocial stress. We hypothesized that psychosocial stress, such as perceived stress overload, may influence epigenetic marks, specifically DNA methylation (DNAm), that contribute to increased risk for cardiovascular disease in African American women.We conducted an epigenome-wide study evaluating the relationship of psychosocial stress and DNAm among African American mothers from the Intergenerational Impact of Genetic and Psychological Factors on Blood Pressure (InterGEN) cohort. Linear mixed effects models were used to explore the epigenome-wide associations with the Stress Overload Scale (SOS), which examines self-reported past-week stress, event load and personal vulnerability.In total, n = 228 participants were included in our analysis. After adjusting for known epigenetic confounders, we did not identify any DNAm sites associated with maternal report of stress measured by SOS after controlling for multiple comparisons. Several of the top differentially methylated CpG sites related to SOS score (P< 1 × 10-5), mapped to genes of unknown significance for hypertension or heart disease, namely,PXDNLandC22orf42.This study provides foundational knowledge for future studies examining epigenetic associations with stress and other psychosocial measures in African Americans, a key area for growth in epigenetics. Future studies including larger sample sizes and replication data are warranted.© The Author(s) 2022."
phenotype,adults,36243740,Clin Epigenetics,South Asian vs European,blood,939 (SABRE) + 916 (BiB),16433 (76% due to cell composition),Characterisation of ethnic differences in DNA methylation between UK-resident South Asians and Europeans.,"Ethnic differences in non-communicable disease risk have been described between individuals of South Asian and European ethnicity that are only partially explained by genetics and other known risk factors. DNA methylation is one underexplored mechanism that may explain differences in disease risk. Currently, there is little knowledge of how DNA methylation varies between South Asian and European ethnicities. This study characterised differences in blood DNA methylation between individuals of self-reported European and South Asian ethnicity from two UK-based cohorts: Southall and Brent Revisited and Born in Bradford. DNA methylation differences between ethnicities were widespread throughout the genome (n = 16,433 CpG sites, 3.4% sites tested). Specifically, 76% of associations were attributable to ethnic differences in cell composition with fewer effects attributable to smoking and genetic variation. Ethnicity-associated CpG sites were enriched for EWAS Catalog phenotypes including metabolites. This work highlights the need to consider ethnic diversity in epigenetic research.© 2022.

phenotype,children,36241462,Biol Psychiatry,externalizing behavior,blood,506 teens from IMAGEN,1,"Associations of DNA Methylation With Behavioral Problems, Gray Matter Volumes, and Negative Life Events Across Adolescence: Evidence From the Longitudinal IMAGEN Study.","Negative life events (NLEs) increase the risk for externalizing behaviors (EBs) and internalizing behaviors (IBs) in adolescence and adult psychopathology. DNA methylation associated with behavioral problems may reflect this risk and long-lasting effects of NLEs.To identify consistent associations between blood DNA methylation and EBs or IBs across adolescence, we conducted longitudinal epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) using data from the IMAGEN cohort, collected at ages 14 and 19 years (n = 506). Significant findings were validated in a separate subsample (n = 823). Methylation risk scores were generated by 10-fold cross-validation and further tested for their associations with gray matter volumes and NLEs.No significant findings were obtained for the IB-EWAS. The EB-EWAS identified a genome-wide significant locus in a gene linked to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (IQSEC1, cg01460382; p = 1.26 × 10-8). Other most significant CpG sites were near ADHD-related genes and enriched for genes regulating tumor necrosis factor and interferon-γ signaling, highlighting the relevance of EB-EWAS findings for ADHD. Analyses with the EB methylation risk scores suggested that it partly reflected comorbidity with IBs in late adolescence. Specific to EBs, EB methylation risk scores correlated with smaller gray matter volumes in medial orbitofrontal and anterior/middle cingulate cortices, brain regions known to associate with ADHD and conduct problems. Longitudinal mediation analyses indicated that EB-related DNA methylation were more likely the outcomes of problematic behaviors accentuated by NLEs, and less likely the epigenetic bases of such behaviors.Our findings suggest that novel epigenetic mechanisms through which NLEs exert short and longer-term effects on behavior may contribute to ADHD.Copyright © 2022.

exposure,infants,36217170,Clin Epigenetics,fetal phthalates and bisphenols,cord blood,306,null,Fetal exposure to phthalates and bisphenols and DNA methylation at birth: the Generation R Study.,"Phthalates and bisphenols are non-persistent endocrine disrupting chemicals that are ubiquitously present in our environment and may have long-lasting health effects following fetal exposure. A potential mechanism underlying these exposure-outcome relationships is differential DNA methylation. Our objective was to examine the associations of maternal phthalate and bisphenol concentrations during pregnancy with DNA methylation in cord blood using a chemical mixtures approach.This study was embedded in a prospective birth cohort study in the Netherlands and included 306 participants. We measured urine phthalates and bisphenols concentrations in the first, second and third trimester. Cord blood DNA methylation in their children was processed using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip using an epigenome-wide association approach. Using quantile g-computation, we examined the association of increasing all mixture components by one quartile with cord blood DNA methylation.We did not find evidence for statistically significant associations of a maternal mixture of phthalates and bisphenols during any of the trimesters of pregnancy with DNA methylation in cord blood (all p values > 4.01 * 10-8). However, we identified one suggestive association (p value < 1.0 * 10-6) of the first trimester maternal mixture of phthalates and bisphenols and three suggestive associations of the second trimester maternal mixture of phthalates and bisphenols with DNA methylation in cord blood.Although we did not identify genome-wide significant results, we identified some suggestive associations of exposure to a maternal mixture of phthalates and bisphenols in the first and second trimester with DNA methylation in cord blood that need further exploration in larger study samples.© 2022.

exposure,children,36206092,Hum Reprod,ART embryo culture,saliva,120 children age 9,null,"At age 9, the methylome of assisted reproductive technology children that underwent embryo culture in different media is not significantly different on a genome-wide scale.","Can we detect DNA methylation differences between ART children that underwent embryo culture in different media?We identified no significant differences in site-specific or regional DNA methylation between the different culture medium groups.Embryo culture in G3 or K-SICM medium leads to differences in embryonic, neonatal and childhood outcomes, including growth and weight. The methylome may mediate this association as the period of in vitro culture of ART treatments coincides with epigenetic reprogramming.This study was conducted as a follow-up to a previous culture medium comparison study in which couples were pseudo-randomized to embryo culture in G3 or K-SICM medium. Of the resultant singletons, 120 (n = 65 G3, n = 55 K-SICM), were recruited at age 9.The ART children provided a saliva sample from which the methylome was analysed using the Infinium MethylationEPIC array. After quality and context filtering, 106 (n = 57 G3, n = 49 K-SICM) samples and 659 708 sites were retained for the analyses. Differential methylation analyses were conducted using mixed effects linear models corrected for age, sex, sample plate and cell composition. These were applied to all cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) sites, various genomic regions (genes, promoters, CpG Islands (CGIs)) and as a targeted analysis of imprinted genes and birth weight-associated CpG sites. Differential variance was assessed using the improved epigenetic variable outliers for risk prediction analysis (iEVORA) algorithm and methylation outliers were identified using a previously defined threshold (upper or lower quartile plus or minus three times the interquartile range, respectively).After correcting for multiple testing, we did not identify any significantly differentially methylated CpG sites, genes, promoters or CGIs between G3 and K-SICM children despite a lenient corrected P-value threshold of 0.1. Targeted analyses of (sites within) imprinted genes and birth weight-associated sites also did not identify any significant differences. The number of DNA methylation outliers per sample was comparable between the culture medium groups. iEVORA identified 101 differentially variable CpG sites of which 94 were more variable in the G3 group.Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) GSE196432.To detect significant methylation differences with a magnitude of <10% between the groups many more participants would be necessary; however, the clinical relevance of such small differences is unclear.The results of this study are reassuring, suggesting that if there is an effect of the culture medium on DNA methylation (and methylation-mediated diseases risk), it does not differ between the two media investigated here. The findings concur with other methylome studies of ART neonates and children that underwent embryo culture in different media, which also found no significant methylome differences.Study funded by March of Dimes (6-FY13-153), EVA (Erfelijkheid Voortplanting & Aanleg) specialty programme (grant no.

phenotype,adults,36201768,Psychosom Med,optimism,blood,3816 women; 667 men,13 using 'PC-correction',Epigenome-wide analysis of DNA methylation and optimism in women and men.,"Higher optimism is associated with reduced mortality and a lower risk of age-related chronic diseases. DNA methylation (DNAm) may provide insight into mechanisms underlying these relationships. We hypothesized DNAm would differ among older individuals who are more versus less optimistic.Using cross-sectional data from two population-based cohorts of women with diverse races/ethnicities (N = 3,816) and men (only white, N = 667), we investigated the associations of optimism with epigenome-wide leukocyte DNAm. Random-effects meta-analyses were subsequently used to pool the inabldividual results. Significantly differentially methylated cytosine-phosphate-guanines (CpGs) were identified by the number of independent degrees of freedom approach: effective degrees of freedom correction using the number of principal components (PCs), explaining>95% of the variation of the DNAm data (PC-correction). We performed regional analyses using comb-p and pathways analyses using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software.We found essentially all CpGs (total probe N = 359,862) were homogeneous across sex and race/ethnicity in the DNAm~optimism association. In the single CpG site analyses based on homogeneous CpGs, we identified 13 significantly differentially methylated probes using PC-correction. We found four significantly differentially methylated regions and two significantly differentially methylated pathways. The annotated genes from the single CpG site and regional analyses are involved in psychiatric disorders, cardiovascular disease, cognitive impairment, and cancer. Identified pathways were related to cancer, neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders.Our findings provide new insights into possible mechanisms underlying optimism and health.Copyright © 2022 by the American Psychosomatic Society."
exposure,children,36196007,J Nutr,periconceptional folic acid supplementation,saliva,89 mothers; 179 adolescents (Chinese),null,Maternal Periconceptional Folic Acid Supplementation and DNA Methylation Patterns in Adolescent Offspring.,"Folate, including the folic acid form, is a key component of the one-carbon metabolic pathway used for DNA methylation. Changes in DNA methylation patterns during critical development periods are associated with disease outcomes and are associated with changes in nutritional status in pregnancy. The long-term impact of periconceptional folic acid supplementation on DNA methylation patterns is unknown.To determine the long-term impact of periconceptional folic acid supplementation on DNA methylation patterns, we examined the association of the recommended dosage (400 μg/d) and time period (periconceptional before pregnancy through first trimester) of folic acid supplementation with the DNA methylation patterns in the offspring at age 14-17 y compared with offspring with no supplementation.Two geographic sites in China from the 1993-1995 Community Intervention Program of folic acid supplementation were selected for the follow-up study. DNA methylation at 402,730 CpG sites was assessed using saliva samples from 89 mothers and 179 adolescents (89 male). The mean age at saliva collection was 40 y among mothers (range: 35-54 y) and 15 y among adolescents (range: 14-17 y). Epigenome-wide analyses were conducted to assess the interactions of periconceptional folic acid exposure, the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR)-C677T genotype, and epigenome-wide DNA methylation controlling for offspring sex, geographic region, and background cell composition in the saliva.In the primary outcome, no significant differences were observed in epigenome-wide methylation patterns between adolescents exposed and those non-exposed to maternal periconceptional folic acid supplementation after adjustment for potential confounders [false discovery rate (FDR) P values < 0.05]. The MTHFR-C677T genotype did not modify this lack of association (FDR P values < 0.05).Overall, there were no differences in DNA methylation between adolescents who were exposed during the critical developmental window and those not exposed to the recommended periconceptional/first-trimester dosage of folic acid.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Society for Nutrition 2022."
phenotype,adults,36180927,Clin Epigenetics,stroke outcome,blood at baseline and at discharge,643,2,Altered methylation pattern in EXOC4 is associated with stroke outcome: an epigenome-wide association study.,"The neurological course after stroke is highly variable and is determined by demographic, clinical and genetic factors. However, other heritable factors such as epigenetic DNA methylation could play a role in neurological changes after stroke.We performed a three-stage epigenome-wide association study to evaluate DNA methylation associated with the difference between the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) at baseline and at discharge (ΔNIHSS) in ischaemic stroke patients. DNA methylation data in the Discovery (n = 643) and Replication (n = 62) Cohorts were interrogated with the 450 K and EPIC BeadChip. Nominal CpG sites from the Discovery (p value < 10-06) were also evaluated in a meta-analysis of the Discovery and Replication cohorts, using a random-fixed effect model. Metabolic pathway enrichment was calculated with methylGSA. We integrated the methylation data with 1305 plasma protein expression levels measured by SOMAscan in 46 subjects and measured RNA expression with RT-PCR in a subgroup of 13 subjects. Specific cell-type methylation was assessed using EpiDISH.The meta-analysis revealed an epigenome-wide significant association in EXOC4 (p value = 8.4 × 10-08) and in MERTK (p value = 1.56 × 10-07). Only the methylation in EXOC4 was also associated in the Discovery and in the Replication Cohorts (p value = 1.14 × 10-06and p value = 1.3 × 10-02, respectively). EXOC4 methylation negatively correlated with the long-term outcome (coefficient = - 4.91) and showed a tendency towards a decrease in EXOC4 expression (rho = - 0.469, p value = 0.091). Pathway enrichment from the meta-analysis revealed significant associations related to the endocytosis and deubiquitination processes. Seventy-nine plasma proteins were differentially expressed in association with EXOC4 methylation. Pathway analysis of these proteins showed an enrichment in natural killer (NK) cell activation. The cell-type methylation analysis in blood also revealed a differential methylation in NK cells.DNA methylation of EXOC4 is associated with a worse neurological course after stroke. The results indicate a potential modulation of pathways involving endocytosis and NK cells regulation.© 2022. The Author(s)."
phenotype,adults,36179964,Gene,age-related hearing loss,blood,57 Chinese MZ twins,18-42,"Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of middle-aged and elderly monozygotic twins with age-related hearing loss in Qingdao, China.","To explore the differences in DNA methylation associated with age-related hearing loss in a study of 57 twin pairs from China.Monozygotic twins were identified through the Qingdao Twin Registration system. The median age of participants was > 50 years. Their hearing thresholds were measured using a multilevel pure-tone audiometry assessment. The pure-tone audiometry was calculated at low frequencies (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 kHz), speech frequencies (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 kHz), and high frequencies (4.0 and 8 kHz). The CpG sites were tested using a linear mixed-effects model, and the function of the cis-regulatory regions and ontological enrichments were predicted using the online Genomic Regions Enrichment of Annotations Tool. The differentially methylated regions were identified using a comb-p python library approach.In each of the PTA categories (low-, speech-, high-frequency), age-related hearing loss was detected in 25.9%, 19.3%, and 52.8% of participants. In the low-, speech- and high-frequency categories we identified 18, 42, and 12 individual CpG sites and 6, 11, and 6 differentially methylated regions. The CpG site located near DUSP4 had the strongest association with low- and speech-frequency, while the strongest association with high-frequency was near C21orf58. We identified associations of ALG10 with high-frequency hearing, C3 and LCK with low- and speech-frequency hearing, and GBX2 with low-frequency hearing. Top pathways that may be related to hearing, such as the Notch signaling pathway, were also identified.Our study is the first of its kind to identify these genes and their associated with DNA methylation may play essential roles in the hearing process. The results of our epigenome-wide association study on twins clarify the complex mechanisms underlying age-related hearing loss.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Also, maternal folate intake is associated with decreased risk of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but the mechanism is not known.We evaluated the relationship between periconceptional folate intake by source and DNA methylation at birth in a cohort of pediatric ALL cases and controls in an epigenome-wide association study.Genome-wide DNA methylation status obtained from archived neonatal blood spots from pediatric ALL cases (n = 189) and controls (n = 205) in the California Childhood Leukemia Study (CCLS) from 1995-2008 was compared to periconceptional folate from total, food, and supplemental sources using multivariable linear regression. Further stratification was performed by income, education, ethnicity, and total folate intake. We evaluated variable DNA methylation response to periconceptional folate by ALL case status through an interaction term.Two significant differentially methylated probes (DMPs) were associated with food and supplemental periconceptional folate intake in all subjects (n = 394). The top differentially methylated region at the promoter region of DUSP22 demonstrated DNA hypermethylation in ALL cases but not controls in response to total and food folate intake. We further identified eight interaction term DMPs with variable DNA methylation response to folate intake by ALL case status. Further stratification of the cohort by education and ethnicity revealed a substantially higher number of DMPs associated with supplemental folic acid intake in Hispanic subjects with lower income and education level.We identified modest associations between periconceptional folate intake and DNA methylation differing by source, including variation by ALL case status. Hispanic subjects of lower income and education appear uniquely responsive to periconceptional folate supplementation.© The Author(s) 2022.
