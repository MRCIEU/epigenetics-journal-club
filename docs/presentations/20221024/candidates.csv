"36265764","DNA methylation reprogramming provides insights into light-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis in red pear.","Plant Sci","DNA methylation, an epigenetic mark, is proposed to regulate plant anthocyanin biosynthesis. It well known that light induces anthocyanin accumulation, with bagging treatments commonly used to investigate light-controlled anthocyanin biosynthesis. We studied the DNA methylome landscape during pear skin coloration under various conditions (fruits re-exposed to sunlight after bag removal). The DNA methylation level in gene body/TE and its flanking sequence was generally similar between debagged and bagged treatments, however differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were re-modelled after light-exposure. Both DNA demethylase homologs and the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathways contributed to this re-distribution. A total of 310 DEGs were DMR-associated during light-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis between debagged and bagged treatments. The hypomethylated mCHH context was seen within the promoter of PyUFGT, together with other anthocyanin biosynthesis genes (PyPAL, PyDFR and PyANS). This enhanced transcriptional activation and promoted anthocyanin accumulation after light re-exposure. Unlike previous reports on bud sports, we did not detect DMRs within the MYB10 promoter. Instead, we observed the genome-wide re-distribution of methylation patterns, suggesting different mechanisms underlying methylation patterns of differentially accumulated anthocyanins caused by either bud mutation or environment change. We investigate the dynamic landscape of genome-scale DNA methylation, which is the combined effect of DNA demethylation and RdDM pathway, in the process of light-induced fruit colour formation in pear. This process is regulated by methylation changes on promoter regions of several DEGs. These results provide a DMR-associated DEGs set and new insight into the mechanism of DNA methylation involved in light-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

"36257406","In vitro transdifferentiated signatures of goat preadipocytes into mammary epithelial cells revealed by DNA methylation and transcriptome profiling.","J Biol Chem","During mammary development, the transdifferentiation of mammary preadipocytes is one of the important sources for lactating mammary epithelial cells (MECs). However, there is limited knowledge about the mechanisms of dynamic regulation of transcriptome and genome-wide DNA methylation in the preadipocyte transdifferentiation process. Here, to gain more insight into these mechanisms, preadipocytes were isolated from adipose tissues from around the goat mammary gland (GM-preadipocytes). The GM-preadipocytes were cultured on Matrigel in conditioned media (CM) made from goat MECs to induce GM-preadipocyte-to-MEC transdifferentiation. The transdifferentiated GM-preadipocytes showed high abundance of keratin 18 (KRT18), which is a marker protein of MECs, and formed mammary acinar-like structures after 8 days of induction. Then, we performed transcriptome and DNA methylome profiling of the GM-preadipocytes and transdifferentiated GM-preadipocytes respectively, and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially methylated genes (DMGs) that play underlying roles in the process of transdifferentiation were obtained. Subsequently, we identified the candidate transcription factors (TFs) in regulating the GM-preadipocyte-to-MEC transdifferentiatio by TF-binding motif enrichment analysis of DEGs and DMGs. Meanwhile, the secretory proteome of GM-preadipocytes cultured in CM was also detected. By integrating the transcriptome, DNA methylome, and proteome, three candidate genes, four proteins, and several epigenetic regulatory axes were further identified, which are involved in regulation of the cell cycle, cell polarity establishment, cell adhesion, cell reprogramming, and adipocyte plasticity. These findings provide novel insights into the molecular mechanism of preadipocyte transdifferentiation and mammary development.Copyright © 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

"36253145","A Pilot Analysis of Genome-Wide DNA Methylation Patterns in Mouse Cartilage Reveals Overlapping Epigenetic Signatures of Aging and Osteoarthritis.","ACR Open Rheumatol","Cartilage epigenetic changes are strongly associated with human osteoarthritis (OA). However, the influence of individual environmental OA risk factors on these epigenetic patterns has not been determined; herein we characterize cartilage DNA methylation patterns associated with aging and OA in a mouse model.Murine knee cartilage DNA was extracted from healthy young (16-week, n = 6), old (82-week, n = 6), and young 4-week post-destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) OA (n = 6) C57BL6/J mice. Genome-wide DNA methylation patterns were determined via Illumina BeadChip. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. The top seven most differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were confirmed by pyrosequencing in an independent animal set. Results were compared to previously published human OA methylation data.Aging was associated with 20,940 DMPs, whereas OA was associated with 761 DMPs. Merging these two conditions revealed 279 shared DMPs. All demonstrated similar directionality and magnitude of change (Δβ 1.0% ± 0.2%, mean methylation change ± SEM). Shared DMPs were enriched in OA-associated pathways, including RhoA signaling (P = 1.57 × 10-4), protein kinase A signaling (P = 3.38 × 10-4), and NFAT signaling (P = 6.14 × 10-4). Upstream regulators, including TET3 (P = 6.15 × 10-4), immunoglobulin (P = 6.14 × 10-4), and TLR7 (P = 7.53 × 10-4), were also enriched. Pyrosequencing confirmed six of the seven top DMPs in an independent cohort.Aging and early OA following DMM surgery induce similar DNA methylation changes within a murine OA model, suggesting that aging may induce pro-OA epigenetic ""poising"" within articular cartilage. Future research should focus on confirming and expanding these findings to other environmental OA risk factors, including obesity, as well as determining late OA changes in mice.© 2022 The Authors.

"36249271","Epigenome-wide association of neonatal methylation and trimester-specific prenatal PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure.","Environ Epidemiol","Exposure to particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter smaller than 2.5 microns (PM2.5) can affect birth outcomes through physiological pathways such as inflammation. One potential way PM2.5affects physiology could be through altering DNA methylation (DNAm). Considering that exposures during specific windows of gestation may have unique effects on DNAm, we hypothesized a timing-specific association between PM2.5exposure during pregnancy and DNAm in the neonatal epithelial-cell epigenome.After collecting salivary samples from a cohort of 91 neonates, DNAm was assessed at over 850,000 cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) methylation sites on the epigenome using the MethylationEPIC array. Daily ambient PM2.5concentrations were estimated based on the mother's address of primary residence during pregnancy. PM2.5was averaged over the first two trimesters, separately and combined, and tested for association with DNAm through an epigenome-wide association (EWA) analysis. For each EWA, false discovery rate (FDR)-correctedP< 0.05 constituted a significant finding and every CpG site with uncorrectedP< 0.0001 was selected to undergo pathway and network analysis to identify molecular functions enriched by them.Our analysis showed that cg18705808 was associated with the combined average of PM2.5. Pathway and network analysis revealed little similarity between the first two trimesters. Previous studies reported thatTMEM184A, the gene regulated by cg18705808, has a putative role in inflammatory pathways.The differences in pathway and network analyses could potentially indicate trimester-specific effects of PM2.5on DNAm. Further analysis with greater temporal resolution would be valuable to fully characterize the effect of PM2.5on DNAm and child development.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

"36246163","Stress Overload and DNA Methylation in African American Women in the Intergenerational Impact of Genetic and Psychological Factors on Blood Pressure Study.","Epigenet Insights","Experiencing psychosocial stress is associated with poor health outcomes such as hypertension and obesity, which are risk factors for developing cardiovascular disease. African American women experience disproportionate risk for cardiovascular disease including exposure to high levels of psychosocial stress. We hypothesized that psychosocial stress, such as perceived stress overload, may influence epigenetic marks, specifically DNA methylation (DNAm), that contribute to increased risk for cardiovascular disease in African American women.We conducted an epigenome-wide study evaluating the relationship of psychosocial stress and DNAm among African American mothers from the Intergenerational Impact of Genetic and Psychological Factors on Blood Pressure (InterGEN) cohort. Linear mixed effects models were used to explore the epigenome-wide associations with the Stress Overload Scale (SOS), which examines self-reported past-week stress, event load and personal vulnerability.In total, n = 228 participants were included in our analysis. After adjusting for known epigenetic confounders, we did not identify any DNAm sites associated with maternal report of stress measured by SOS after controlling for multiple comparisons. Several of the top differentially methylated CpG sites related to SOS score (P< 1 × 10-5), mapped to genes of unknown significance for hypertension or heart disease, namely,PXDNLandC22orf42.This study provides foundational knowledge for future studies examining epigenetic associations with stress and other psychosocial measures in African Americans, a key area for growth in epigenetics.

"36245757","High-Level <i>MYCN-</i>Amplified <i>RB1-</i>Proficient Retinoblastoma Tumors Retain Distinct Molecular Signatures.","Ophthalmol Sci","Retinoblastomas are malignant eye tumors diagnosed in young children. Most retinoblastomas are genetically characterized by biallelic inactivation of theRB1gene. However, 1.5% of tumors demonstrate high-level amplification of the proto-oncogeneMYCN. Patients withMYCN-amplifiedRB1-proficient retinoblastoma receive a diagnosis at an earlier age and show a clinically and histologically more malignant phenotype. This study aimed to identify genome-wide molecular features that distinguish this subtype from other retinoblastomas.Cohort study.Forty-seven retinoblastoma tumors, comprising 36RB1-/-, 4RB1+/-, and 7RB1+/+tumors. In total, 5 retinoblastomas displayed high-levelMYCNamplification, with 3 beingRB1+/+, 1 beingRB1+/-, and 1 beingRB1-/-.Integrated analysis, based on gene expression, methylation, and methylation-expression correlations, was performed to identify distinct molecular components ofMYCN-amplifiedRB1-proficient retinoblastomas compared with other retinoblastoma subtypes. The methylation and methylation-expression correlation analysis was initially conducted within a subset of samples (n = 15) for which methylation profiles were available. The significant findings were cross-validated in the entire cohort (n = 47) and in publicly available data.Differentially expressed genes/pathways, differentially methylated genes, and methylation-driven differential gene expression.A large number of genes (n = 3155) were identified with distinct expression patterns inMYCN-amplifiedRB1-proficient retinoblastomas. The upregulated and downregulated genes were associated with translation and cell-cycle processes, respectively. Methylation analysis revealed distinct methylated patterns inMYCN-amplifiedRB1-proficient tumors, many of which showing significant impact on gene expression. Data integration identified a 40-gene expression signature with hypermethylated state resulting in a significant downregulation inMYCN-amplifiedRB1-proficient retinoblastomas. Cross-validation using the entire cohort and the public domain expression data verified the overall lower expression of these genes not only in retinoblastomas with aMYCN-amplifiedRB1-proficient background, but also inMYCN-amplified neuroblastomas. These include the metabolism-associatedTSTD1gene and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor geneCDKN2C.MYCN-amplifiedRB1-proficient retinoblastomas display significantly distinct molecular features compared with other retinoblastomas, including a set of 40 hypermethylation-driven downregulated genes. This gene set can give insight into the biology ofMYCN-amplified retinoblastomas and may help us to understand the more aggressive clinical behavior.© 2022 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology."
"36244592","The impact of Piscirickettsia salmonis infection on genome-wide DNA methylation profile in Atlantic Salmon.","Genomics","Salmon rickettsial septicaemia (SRS), caused by the bacteria Piscirickettsia salmonis (P. salmonis), is responsible for significant mortality in farmed Atlantic salmon in Chile. Currently there are no effective treatments or preventive measures for this disease, although genetic selection or genome engineering to increase salmon resistance to SRS are promising strategies. The accuracy and efficiency of these strategies are usually influenced by the available biological background knowledge of the disease. The aim of this study was to investigate DNA methylation changes in response to P. salmonis infection in the head kidney and liver tissue of Atlantic salmon, and the interaction between gene expression and DNA methylation in the same tissues. The head kidney and liver methylomes of 66 juvenile salmon were profiled using reduced representation bisulphite sequencing (RRBS), and compared between P. salmonis infected animals (3 and 9 days post infection) and uninfected controls, and between SRS resistant and susceptible fish. Methylation was correlated with matching RNA-Seq data from the same animals, revealing that methylation in the first exon leads to an important repression of gene expression. Head kidney methylation showed a clear response to the infection, associated with immunological processes such as actin cytoskeleton regulation, phagocytosis, endocytosis and pathogen associated pattern receptor signaling. Our results contribute to the growing understanding of the role of methylation in regulation of gene expression and response to infectious diseases and could inform the incorporation of epigenetic markers into genomic selection for disease resistant and the design of diagnostic epigenetic markers to better manage fish health in salmon aquaculture.Copyright © 2022.

"36243740","Characterisation of ethnic differences in DNA methylation between UK-resident South Asians and Europeans.","Clin Epigenetics","Ethnic differences in non-communicable disease risk have been described between individuals of South Asian and European ethnicity that are only partially explained by genetics and other known risk factors. DNA methylation is one underexplored mechanism that may explain differences in disease risk. Currently, there is little knowledge of how DNA methylation varies between South Asian and European ethnicities. This study characterised differences in blood DNA methylation between individuals of self-reported European and South Asian ethnicity from two UK-based cohorts: Southall and Brent Revisited and Born in Bradford. DNA methylation differences between ethnicities were widespread throughout the genome (n = 16,433 CpG sites, 3.4% sites tested). Specifically, 76% of associations were attributable to ethnic differences in cell composition with fewer effects attributable to smoking and genetic variation. Ethnicity-associated CpG sites were enriched for EWAS Catalog phenotypes including metabolites. This work highlights the need to consider ethnic diversity in epigenetic research.© 2022.

"36243213","Mediation by DNA methylation on the association of BMI and serum uric acid in Chinese monozygotic twins.","Gene","Obesity is an established risk factor for hyperuricemia, but the mechanisms are only partially understood. We examined whether BMI-related DNA methylation (DNAm) variation would mediate the association of BMI with serum uric acid (SUA). We first conducted an epigenome-wide association analysis (EWAS) in 64 monozygotic twin pairs to detect BMI-related DNAm variation and then evaluated the mediated effect of DNAm using mediation analysis. Ontology enrichments analysis was performed for CpGs using GREAT tool. The genes where the candidate CpG mediators mapped were validated using gene expression data. BMI was positively associated with log10transformed SUA level (β = 0.01, P < 0.001). The association between BMI and DNAm of 138 CpGs reached P < 1 × 10-4level. Twenty BMI-related differentially methylated regions within MAP2K2, POU4F2, AGAP2, MRGPRE, ADM5, and NKX1-1 were found. Of the 138 CpGs, 4 within VENTX (involved in cellular responses to stress pathway), SMOC2 (enable calcium ion binding), and FSCN2 (a member of fascin protein family) mediated the association between BMI and SUA, with a mediating effect of 0.002-μmol/L lower log10transformed SUA levels and a proportion of 18.89 %-24.92 % negative mediating effect. BMI × DNAm interactions on SUA were observed for 2 CpGs within VENTX. The gene expression level of VENTX was also negatively associated with SUA level. BMI-related DNAm variation may partially mediate the association of BMI with SUA.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"36242743","Childhood Trauma and Epigenetics: State of the Science and Future.","Curr Environ Health Rep","There is a great deal of interest regarding the biological embedding of childhood trauma and social exposures through epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation (DNAm), but a comprehensive understanding has been hindered by issues of limited reproducibility between studies. This review presents a summary of the literature on childhood trauma and DNAm, highlights issues in the field, and proposes some potential solutions.Investigations of the associations between DNAm and childhood trauma are commonly performed using candidate gene approaches, specifically involving genes related to neurological and stress pathways. Childhood trauma is defined in a wide range of ways in several societal contexts. However, although variations in DNAm are frequently found in stress-related genes, unsupervised epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) have shown limited reproducibility both between studies and in relating these changes to exposures. The reproducibility of childhood trauma DNAm studies, and the field of social epigenetics in general, may be improved by increasing sample sizes, standardizing variables, making use of effect size thresholds, collecting longitudinal and intervention samples, appropriately accounting for known confounding factors, and applying causal analysis wherever possible, such as ""two-step epigenetic Mendelian randomization.""© 2022.

"36242584","A systematic assessment of cell type deconvolution algorithms for DNA methylation data.","Brief Bioinform","We performed systematic assessment of computational deconvolution methods that play an important role in the estimation of cell type proportions from bulk methylation data. The proposed framework methylDeConv (available as an R package) integrates several deconvolution methods for methylation profiles (Illumina HumanMethylation450 and MethylationEPIC arrays) and offers different cell-type-specific CpG selection to construct the extended reference library which incorporates the main immune cell subsets, epithelial cells and cell-free DNAs. We compared the performance of different deconvolution algorithms via simulations and benchmark datasets and further investigated the associations of the estimated cell type proportions to cancer therapy in breast cancer and subtypes in melanoma methylation case studies. Our results indicated that the deconvolution based on the extended reference library is critical to obtain accurate estimates of cell proportions in non-blood tissues.© The Author(s) 2022.

"36242045","Cri du chat syndrome patients have DNA methylation changes in genes linked to symptoms of the disease.","Clin Epigenetics","Cri du chat (also called 5p deletion, or monosomy 5p) syndrome is a genetic disease caused by deletions of various lengths in the short (p) arm of chromosome 5. Genetic analysis and phenotyping have been used to suggest dose-sensitive genes in this region that may cause symptoms when a gene copy is lost, but the heterogeneity of symptoms for patients with similar deletions complicates the picture. The epigenetics of the syndrome has only recently been looked at with DNA methylation measurements of blood from a single patient, suggesting epigenetic changes in these patients. Here, we conduct the deepest epigenetic analysis of the syndrome to date with DNA methylation analysis of eight Cri du chat patients with sibling- and age-matched controls.The genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation in the blood of Cri du chat patients reveal distinct changes compared to controls. In the p-arm of chromosome 5 where patients are hemizygous, we find stronger changes in methylation of CpG sites than what is seen in the rest of the genome, but this effect is less pronounced in gene regulatory sequences. Gene set enrichment analysis using patient DNA methylation changes in gene promoters revealed enrichment of genes controlling embryonic development and genes linked to symptoms which are among the most common symptoms of Cri du chat syndrome: developmental delay and microcephaly. Importantly, this relative enrichment is not driven by changes in the methylation of genes on chromosome 5. CpG sites linked to these symptoms where Cri du chat patients have strong DNA methylation changes are enriched for binding of the polycomb EZH2 complex, H3K27me3, and H3K4me2, indicating changes to bivalent promoters, known to be central to embryonic developmental processes.Finding DNA methylation changes in the blood of Cri du chat patients linked to the most common symptoms of the syndrome is suggestive of epigenetic changes early in embryonic development that may be contributing to the development of symptoms. However, with the present data we cannot conclude about the sequence of events between DNA methylation changes and other cellular functions-the observed differences could be directly driving epigenetic changes, a result of other epigenetic changes, or they could be a reflection of other gene regulatory changes such as changed gene expression levels. We do not know which gene(s) on the p-arm of chromosome 5 that causes epigenetic changes when hemizygous, but an important contribution from this work is making the pool of possible causative genes smaller.© 2022.

"36241462","Associations of DNA Methylation With Behavioral Problems, Gray Matter Volumes, and Negative Life Events Across Adolescence: Evidence From the Longitudinal IMAGEN Study.","Biol Psychiatry","Negative life events (NLEs) increase the risk for externalizing behaviors (EBs) and internalizing behaviors (IBs) in adolescence and adult psychopathology. DNA methylation associated with behavioral problems may reflect this risk and long-lasting effects of NLEs.To identify consistent associations between blood DNA methylation and EBs or IBs across adolescence, we conducted longitudinal epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) using data from the IMAGEN cohort, collected at ages 14 and 19 years (n = 506). Significant findings were validated in a separate subsample (n = 823). Methylation risk scores were generated by 10-fold cross-validation and further tested for their associations with gray matter volumes and NLEs.No significant findings were obtained for the IB-EWAS. The EB-EWAS identified a genome-wide significant locus in a gene linked to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (IQSEC1, cg01460382; p = 1.26 × 10-8). Other most significant CpG sites were near ADHD-related genes and enriched for genes regulating tumor necrosis factor and interferon-γ signaling, highlighting the relevance of EB-EWAS findings for ADHD. Analyses with the EB methylation risk scores suggested that it partly reflected comorbidity with IBs in late adolescence. Specific to EBs, EB methylation risk scores correlated with smaller gray matter volumes in medial orbitofrontal and anterior/middle cingulate cortices, brain regions known to associate with ADHD and conduct problems. Longitudinal mediation analyses indicated that EB-related DNA methylation were more likely the outcomes of problematic behaviors accentuated by NLEs, and less likely the epigenetic bases of such behaviors.Our findings suggest that novel epigenetic mechanisms through which NLEs exert short and longer-term effects on behavior may contribute to ADHD.Copyright © 2022.

The infiltration of immune cells and methylation level of MST4 in tumor and normal tissues were extracted from GEPIA 2021, TISIDB, UALCAN, EWAS, MethSurv, and MEXPRESS database. We also predict the efficacy of outcome prediction with receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC). All proteins expressions of MST4, P62and LC3 were detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in paired Gastric cancer (GC) and para-cancerous normal tissue samples. We verify the effects of MST4 on irradiation-induced gastric death, and also investigate effects of MST4 activating autophagy in gastric cancer cell lines with various in vitro assays using Western blotting.We have confirmed the high transcription level of MST4 from TCGA, USLCAN, HPA, and other portals, but a rapid decrease in protein level. More, MST4 can be considered as an independent prognostic molecule, which has significant prognostic significance in tumor grade, anti-tumor treatment, histological type and time-dependent ROC curve. The methylation degree of MST4 promoter region in tumor is much lower than that in normal tissue, which may be the main reason for the remarkably high transcription level of MST4. In addition, MST4 transcription level was significantly inversely proportional to the infiltration level of most immune cells. The MST4 up-regulation and the positive association of MST4 with autophagy expression were cross-validated in open-access datasets.MST4, as an autophagy-associated protein, plays a potential role in inducing cell death by increasing protein content in radiotherapy.This article is protected by copyright.

The water buffalo is a dairy production animal with wide agro-climatic distribution in India. Breed-wise the coat color of water buffalo varies from ash-grey to jet black. A typical pigmentation pattern is found in one of the breeds of North India, Nili Ravi, with variedly distributed white patches. The DNA methylation pattern could potentially reveal the epigenetic factors responsible for the pigmentation patterns. To address this question, the DNA isolated from the skin tissues of Nili Ravi with varied white pigmentation and black Murrah buffaloes was subjected to reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. DNA methylation analysis revealed, 68.44%, 63.39%, and 47.94% of the promoter regions were hypermethylated in Nili Ravi over-white vs Murrah, Nili Ravi under-white vs Murrah, and Nili Ravi under-white vs Nili Ravi over-white, respectively. Major genes identified to be differentially methylated among over-white and under-white skin tissues in Nili Ravi included TBX2, SNAI2, HERC2, and CITED1. Overall the results have indicated differential methylation patterns to be potentially involved in hyper or hypo-pigmentation in Nili Ravi and Murrah buffaloes.

"36239035","The impact of low input DNA on the reliability of DNA methylation as measured by the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip.","Epigenetics","DNA methylation (DNAm) is commonly assayed using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip, but there is currently little published evidence to define the lower limits of the amount of DNA that can be used whilst preserving data quality. Such evidence is valuable for analyses utilizing precious or limited DNA sources. We used a single pooled sample of DNA in quadruplicate at three dilutions to define replicability and noise, and an independent population dataset of 328 individuals (from a community-based study including US-born non-Hispanic Black and white persons) to assess the impact of total DNA input on the quality of data generated using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. We found that data are less reliable and more noisy as DNA input decreases to 40ng, with clear reductions in data quality; and that low DNA input is associated with a reduction in power to detect EWAS associations, requiring larger sample sizes. We conclude that DNA input as low as 40ng can be used with the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip, provided quality checks and sensitivity analyses are undertaken."

Significantly altered methylation was observed between investigated LINE-1 CpG positions of non-tumorous tissues (p≤ 0.01). Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded biopsies (73.0 ± 5.3%) resulted in lower methylation than fresh frozen samples (76.1 ± 2.8%) (p≤ 0.01). DNA specimens after long-term storage showed higher methylation levels (+3.2%,p≤ 0.01). In blood collection tubes with preservatives, cfDNA and buffy coat methylation significantly changed compared to K3EDTA tubes (p≤ 0.05).

"36230901","Locus-Specific Enrichment Analysis of 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine Reveals Novel Genes Associated with Breast Carcinogenesis.","Cells","An imbalance in DNA methylation is a hallmark epigenetic alteration in cancer. The conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) to 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine (5-hmC), which causes the imbalance, results in aberrant gene expression. The precise functional role of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in breast cancer remains elusive. In this study, we describe the landscape of 5-mC and 5-hmC and their association with breast cancer development. We found a distinguishable global loss of 5-hmC in the localized and invasive types of breast cancer that strongly correlate withTETexpression. Genome-wide analysis revealed a unique 5-mC and 5-hmC signature in breast cancer. The differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were primarily concentrated in the proximal regulatory regions such as the promoters and UTRs, while the differentially hydroxymethylated regions (DhMRs) were densely packed in the distal regulatory regions, such as the intergenic regions (&gt;-5 kb from TSSs). Our results indicate 4809 DMRs and 4841 DhMRs associated with breast cancer. Validation of nine 5-hmC enriched loci in a distinct set of breast cancer and normal samples positively correlated with their corresponding gene expression. The novel 5-hmC candidates such as TXNL1, and CNIH3 implicate a pro-oncogenic role in breast cancer. Overall, these results provide new insights into the loci-specific accumulation of 5-mC and 5-hmC, which are aberrantly methylated and demethylated in breast cancer."

A nested cohort of patients with OSCC and OPMDs was randomly selected from among patients with oral mucosal diseases. Saliva samples were collected, and DNA extracted from cell pellets was processed for reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing. Reads with a minimum of 10× coverage were used to identify differentially methylated CpG sites (DMCs) and 100 bp regions (DMRs). The performance of eight ML models and three feature-selection methods (ANOVA, MRMR, and LASSO) were then compared to determine the optimal biomarker models based on DMCs and DMRs. A total of 1745 DMCs and 105 DMRs were identified for detecting OSCC. The proportion of hypomethylated and hypermethylated DMCs was similar (51% vs. 49%), while most DMRs were hypermethylated (62.9%). Furthermore, more DMRs than DMCs were annotated to promoter regions (36% vs. 16%) and more DMCs than DMRs were annotated to intergenic regions (50% vs. 36%). Of all the ML models compared, the linear SVM model based on 11 optimal DMRs selected by LASSO had a perfect AUC, recall, specificity, and calibration (1.00) for OSCC detection. Overall, genome-wide DNA methylation techniques can be applied directly to saliva samples for biomarker discovery and ML-based platforms may be useful in stratifying OSCC during disease screening and monitoring."

Thus, we sought to evaluate the role of DNA methylation patterns on ""CHD-lymphoma"" associations.From >3 million live births (1988-2004) in California registry linkages, we obtained newborn dried bloodspots from eight children with CHD-lymphoma through the California BioBank. We performed case-control epigenome-wide association analyses (EWAS) using two comparison groups with reciprocal discovery and validation to identify differential methylation associated with CHD-lymphoma.After correction for multiple testing at the discovery and validation stages, individuals with CHD-lymphoma had differential newborn methylation at six sites relative to two comparison groups. Our top finding was significant in both EWAS and indicates PPFIA1 cg25574765 was hypomethylated among individuals with CHD-lymphoma (mean beta = 0.04) relative to both unaffected individuals (mean beta = 0.93, p = 1.5 × 10-12) and individuals with complex CHD (mean beta = 0.95, p = 3.8 × 10-8). PPFIA1 encodes a ubiquitously expressed liprin protein in one of the most commonly amplified regions in many cancers (11q13). Further, cg25574765 is a proposed marker of pre-eclampsia, a maternal CHD risk factor that has not been fully evaluated for lymphoma risk in offspring, and the tumor microenvironment that may drive immune cell malignancies.We identified associations between molecular changes present in the genome at birth and risk of childhood lymphoma among those with CHD. Our findings also highlight novel perinatal exposures that may underlie methylation changes in CHD predisposing to lymphoma.© 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC."

Comprehensive scrutiny of these gene homologs was conducted for gene structure, phylogenetic investigations, chromosome mapping, and subcellular localization of proteins. Promoter analysis uncovered the regions rich with phosphorous- (BIHD), ammonium-, sulfur-responsive (SURE), and iron starvation-responsive (IRO2) along with biotic, abiotic, and development-specificcis-elements. Further, PRPs exhibit more methylation and acetylation sites in comparison with HyPRPs. miRNAs have been predicted which might play a role in cleavage and translation inhibition. Several of theSbPRPgenes were stimulated in a tissue-specific manner under drought, salt, heat, and cold stresses. Additionally, exposure of plants to abscisic acid (ABA) and zinc (Zn) also triggered PRP genes in a tissue-dependent way. Among them,SbPRP17has been found upregulated markedly in all tissues irrespective of the stress imposed. The expressions ofSbHyPRPs, especiallySbHyPRP2,SbHyPRP6, andSbHyPRP17were activated under all stresses in all three tissues. On the other hand,SbHyPRP8(root only) andSbHyPRP12(all three tissues) were highly responsive to cold stress and ABA whileSbHyPRP26was induced by drought and Zn in the stem. Taken together, this study indicates the critical roles thatSbPRPsandSbHyPRPsplay during diverse abiotic stress conditions and notably the plausible roles that these genes play upon exposure to zinc, the crucial micronutrient in plants.Copyright © 2022 Rajasheker, Nagaraju, Varghese, Jalaja, Somanaboina, Singam, Ramakrishna, Penna, Sreenivasulu and Kishor."

Although the DNA methylation pathway has been well studied, the DNA demethylation pathway, however, are not fully understood so far. To gain deeper insights into the mechanisms of DNA demethylation pathway, we conducted a genetic screening for proteins that were involved in preventing epigenetic gene silencing, and then the ones, which were also implicated in DNA demethylation pathway, were used for further studies. Eventually, a mutant with low luciferase luminescence (low LUC luminescence) was recovered, and namedreduced LUC luminescence 6-1(rll6-1). Map-based cloning revealed thatrll6-1mutation was located on chromosome 4, and there were a total of 10 candidate genes residing within such a region. Analyses of genome-wide methylation patterns ofrll6-1mutant showed that mutation ofRLL6locus led to 3,863 hyper-DMRs (DMRs for differentially methylated regions) throughout fiveArabidopsischromosomes, and elevated DNA methylation level of2 × 35Spromoter, which was similar to that found in theros1(repressor of silencing 1) mutant. Further analysis demonstrated that there were 1,456 common hyper-DMRs shared byrll6-1andros1-7mutants, suggesting that both proteins acted together in a synergistic manner to remove DNA methylation. Further investigations demonstrated that mutation ofRLL6locus did not affect the expression of the four genes of the DNA glycosylase/lyase family. Thus, our results demonstrate thatRLL6locus-encoded protein not only participates in transcriptional anti-silencing of a transgene, but is also involved in DNA demethylation pathway.Copyright © 2022 Wang, Wang, Dai, Wang and La."

However, MEs including adenocarcinomas of the esophagogastric junction (AEG) and background non-neoplastic columnar mucosae (NM) remain to be clarified.We analyzed the genome-wide DNA MEs of AEG, GC, and background NM using the Infinium 450 k beadarray, followed by quantitative pyrosequencing validation. Large-scale data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were also reviewed.Unsupervised two-way hierarchical clustering using Infinium data of 21 AEG, 30 GC, and 11 NM revealed four DNA MEs: extremely high-ME (E-HME), high-ME (HME), low-ME (LME), and extremely low-ME (E-LME). Promoter methylation levels were validated by pyrosequencing in 146 samples. Non-inflammatory normal mucosae were clustered into E-LME, whereas gastric or esophagogastric junction mucosae with chronic inflammatory changes caused by either Helicobacter pylori infection or reflux esophagitis were clustered together into LME, suggesting that inflammation status determined DNA MEs regardless of the cause. Three cases of Barrett's-related adenocarcinoma were clustered into HME. Among 94 patients whose tumors could be clustered into one of four MEs, 11 patients with E-LME cancers showed significantly shorter overall survival than that in the other MEs, even with the multivariate Cox regression estimate. TCGA data also showed enrichment of AEG in HME and a poorer prognosis in E-LME.E-LME cases, newly confirmed in this study, form a unique subtype with poor prognosis that is not associated with inflammation-associated elevation of DNA methylation levels. LME could be acquired via chronic inflammation, regardless of the cause, and AEG might preferentially show HME.© 2022.

Epigenetic changes in the normal mucosa of patients with colorectal cancer can serve as a tool in predicting colorectal cancer outcomes. We identified epigenetic changes affecting the normal mucosa of patients with colorectal cancer. DNA methylation profiling on normal colon mucosa from 77 patients with colorectal cancer and 68 controls identified a distinct subgroup of normally-appearing mucosa with markedly disrupted DNA methylation at a large number of CpGs, termed as ""Outlier Methylation Phenotype"" (OMP) and are present in 15 of 77 patients with cancer versus 0 of 68 controls (P < 0.001). Similar findings were also seen in publicly available datasets. Comparison of normal colon mucosa transcription profiles of patients with OMP cancer with those of patients with non-OMP cancer indicates genes whose promoters are hypermethylated in the OMP patients are also transcriptionally downregulated, and that many of the genes most affected are involved in interactions between epithelial cells, the mucus layer, and the microbiome. Analysis of 16S rRNA profiles suggests that normal colon mucosa of OMPs are enriched in bacterial genera associated with colorectal cancer risk, advanced tumor stage, chronic intestinal inflammation, malignant transformation, nosocomial infections, and KRAS mutations. In conclusion, our study identifies an epigenetically distinct OMP group in the normal mucosa of patients with colorectal cancer that is characterized by a disrupted methylome, altered gene expression, and microbial dysbiosis. Prospective studies are needed to determine whether OMP could serve as a biomarker for an elevated epigenetic risk for colorectal cancer development.Our study identifies an epigenetically distinct OMP group in the normal mucosa of patients with colorectal cancer that is characterized by a disrupted methylome, altered gene expression, and microbial dysbiosis.

A potential mechanism underlying these exposure-outcome relationships is differential DNA methylation. Our objective was to examine the associations of maternal phthalate and bisphenol concentrations during pregnancy with DNA methylation in cord blood using a chemical mixtures approach.This study was embedded in a prospective birth cohort study in the Netherlands and included 306 participants. We measured urine phthalates and bisphenols concentrations in the first, second and third trimester. Cord blood DNA methylation in their children was processed using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip using an epigenome-wide association approach. Using quantile g-computation, we examined the association of increasing all mixture components by one quartile with cord blood DNA methylation.We did not find evidence for statistically significant associations of a maternal mixture of phthalates and bisphenols during any of the trimesters of pregnancy with DNA methylation in cord blood (all p values > 4.01 * 10-8). However, we identified one suggestive association (p value < 1.0 * 10-6) of the first trimester maternal mixture of phthalates and bisphenols and three suggestive associations of the second trimester maternal mixture of phthalates and bisphenols with DNA methylation in cord blood.Although we did not identify genome-wide significant results, we identified some suggestive associations of exposure to a maternal mixture of phthalates and bisphenols in the first and second trimester with DNA methylation in cord blood that need further exploration in larger study samples.© 2022.

"36215393","Long-term epigenetic and metabolomic changes in the mouse ventricular myocardium after exertional heat stroke.","Physiol Genomics","Evidence from human epidemiological studies suggests that exertional heat stroke (EHS) results in elevated risk of long-term cardiovascular and systemic disease. Previous results using a preclinical mouse model of EHS demonstrated severe metabolic imbalances in ventricular myocardium developing at 9-14 d of recovery. Whether this resolves over time is unknown. We hypothesized that long-term effects of EHS on the heart reflect retained maladaptive epigenetic responses. In this study, we evaluated genome-wide DNA methylation, RNA-Seq and metabolomic profiles of the left ventricular myocardium in female C57BL/6 mice, 30 d after EHS (exercise in 37.5°C; n = 7-8), compared to exercise controls. EHS mice ran to loss of consciousness, reaching core temperatures of 42.4±0.2°C. All mice recovered quickly. After 30 d, the left ventricles were rapidly frozen for DNA methyl sequencing, RNA-Seq and untargeted metabolomics. Ventricular DNA from EHS mice revealed >13,000 differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs) and >900 differentially methylated regions (DMRs;≥5 DMCs with ≤300 bp between each CpG). Pathway analysis using DMRs revealed alterations in genes regulating basic cell functions, DNA binding, transcription and metabolism. Metabolomics and mRNA expression revealed modest changes that are consistent with a return to homeostasis. Methylation status did not predict RNA expression or metabolomic state at 30 d. We conclude that EHS induces a sustained DNA methylation memory lasting over 30 d of recovery, but ventricular gene expression and metabolism return to a relative homeostasis at rest. Such long-lasting alterations to the DNA methylation landscape could alter responsiveness to environmental or clinical challenges later in life."

In this study, we aimed to profile the DNA methylation patterns in a mouse model of airway inflammation induced by cigarette smoke (CS), a foremost risk factor of COPD.To establish a model of airway inflammation, wild-type mice were exposed to mainstream CS or room air for 2 hours twice daily, 6 days per week for consecutive 4 weeks. Lung tissues of the mice were collected for genome-wide DNA methylation analysis by liquid hybridization capture-based bisulfite sequencing, which were used for intersection analysis with gene expression by cDNA microarray to identify candidate methylated genes. Then, functional enrichment analyses with protein-protein interaction (PPI) network regarding these genes were conducted to explore the potential mechanisms.After 4-week CS exposure, the level of DNA methylation accompanied by a subacute airway inflammation was markedly enhanced, and 2002 differentially methylated genes (DMGs) were annotated, including 565 DMGs contained methylations in gene promoters, which were used for intersection with the differentially expressed genes. Then, 135 candidate methylated genes were further selected by the intersection, among which 58 genes with functional methylated modification were finally identified. Further analyses revealed candidate methylated genes were significantly enriched in a complicated network of signals and processes, including interleukins, toll-like receptors, T-cells differentiation, oxidative stress, mast cells activation, stem cells proliferation, etc., as well as the 58 functional methylated genes were partially located at key positions in PPI network, especially CXCL1, DDX58 and JAK3.This study suggests CS exposure significantly enhances DNA methylated level, and the potential functional methylated genes are closely related to complicated inflammatory-immune responses, which may provide some new experimental evidence in understanding the epigenetic mechanisms of CS-induced airway inflammation in COPD.© 2022 Li et al."

The methylome may mediate this association as the period of in vitro culture of ART treatments coincides with epigenetic reprogramming.This study was conducted as a follow-up to a previous culture medium comparison study in which couples were pseudo-randomized to embryo culture in G3 or K-SICM medium. Of the resultant singletons, 120 (n = 65 G3, n = 55 K-SICM), were recruited at age 9.The ART children provided a saliva sample from which the methylome was analysed using the Infinium MethylationEPIC array. After quality and context filtering, 106 (n = 57 G3, n = 49 K-SICM) samples and 659 708 sites were retained for the analyses. Differential methylation analyses were conducted using mixed effects linear models corrected for age, sex, sample plate and cell composition. These were applied to all cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) sites, various genomic regions (genes, promoters, CpG Islands (CGIs)) and as a targeted analysis of imprinted genes and birth weight-associated CpG sites. Differential variance was assessed using the improved epigenetic variable outliers for risk prediction analysis (iEVORA) algorithm and methylation outliers were identified using a previously defined threshold (upper or lower quartile plus or minus three times the interquartile range, respectively).After correcting for multiple testing, we did not identify any significantly differentially methylated CpG sites, genes, promoters or CGIs between G3 and K-SICM children despite a lenient corrected P-value threshold of 0.1. Targeted analyses of (sites within) imprinted genes and birth weight-associated sites also did not identify any significant differences. The number of DNA methylation outliers per sample was comparable between the culture medium groups. iEVORA identified 101 differentially variable CpG sites of which 94 were more variable in the G3 group.Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) GSE196432.To detect significant methylation differences with a magnitude of <10% between the groups many more participants would be necessary; however, the clinical relevance of such small differences is unclear.The results of this study are reassuring, suggesting that if there is an effect of the culture medium on DNA methylation (and methylation-mediated diseases risk), it does not differ between the two media investigated here.

The RNAm-SNPs were associated with gene expression (e.g.,MRAS, DHX36, TCF21, JCADandSH2B3), and the expression levels were associated with CAD. Differential m6A methylation and differential expression in FTO-overexpressing human aorta smooth muscle cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells of CAD patients and controls were detected. The RNAm-SNPs were associated with circulating levels of proteins with specific biological functions, such as blood coagulation, and the proteins (e.g., cardiotrophin-1) were confirmed to be associated with CAD and AMI in MR analyses.The present study identified RNAm-SNPs in CAD susceptibility genes, gene expression and circulating proteins as risk factors for CAD and suggested that RNA modification may play a role in the pathogenesis of CAD.Copyright © 2022 Li, Zhang, Tang, Duan, Liu, Wu, Zhang, Wang and Mo."

Although DNA methylation is an essential epigenetic mechanism, fundamental aspects of its contribution to stress responses and adaptation remain obscure. We investigated epigenome dynamics of wild strawberry (Fragaria vesca) in response to variable ecologically relevant environmental conditions at the DNA methylation level.F. vescamethylome responded with great plasticity to ecologically relevant abiotic and hormonal stresses. Thermal stress resulted in substantial genome-wide loss of DNA methylation. Notably, all tested stress conditions resulted in marked hot spots of differential DNA methylation near centromeric or pericentromeric regions, particularly in the non-symmetrical DNA methylation context. Additionally, we identified differentially methylated regions (DMRs) within promoter regions of transcription factor (TF) superfamilies involved in plant stress-response and assessed the effects of these changes on gene expression.

Celastrol, a Chinese herbal compound, shows potent anti-tumor effects through multiple signaling pathways. However, the involvement of histone modifications in this process has not yet been illustrated. In this study, barcode sequencing of a eukaryotic genome-wide deletion library revealed that histone modifications, especially histone acetylation associated with the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex, were involved in the anti-proliferation actions of celastrol. The essential roles of histone modification were verified by celastrol sensitivity tests in cells lacking specific genes, such as genes encoding the subunits of the NuA4 and Swr1 complex. The combination of celastrol and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), rather than the combination of celastrol and histone acetyltransferase inhibitors, synergistically suppressed cancer cell proliferation. In addition to upregulating H4K16 acetylation (H4K16ac), celastrol regulates H3K4 tri-methylation and H3S10 phosphorylation. Celastrol treatment significantly enhanced the suppressive effects of HDACi on lung cancer cell allografts in mice, with significant H4K16ac upregulation, indicating that a combination of celastrol and HDACi is a potential novel therapeutic approach for patients with lung cancer.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

Folic acid (FA) supplementation is an effective for prevention of a proportion of NTDs, however, the mechanism remains unclear. In this study, our data demonstrated genome-wide enrichment of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) modification on active transcriptional start sites (TSS) and decreased 5-methylcytosine (5mC) binding to TSS under folate deficiency in mESCs (mouse embryonic stem cells). Furthermore, folate deficiency promoted 5hmC enrichment enhancer histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) binding to Shh pathway genes in mESCs. Upregulation of Shh target genes was observed in mouse brain tissue under low levels of maternal serum folate, along with increased expression of 5-methylcytosine dioxygenase Tet1 levels. Taken together, we found that folate deficiency promoted DNA demethylation and enriched 5hmC through recruitment of H3K27ac to activate the Shh signaling pathway. These results suggest that the 5hmC modification increases concomitantly with a positive correlation to Shh gene expression in folate deficiency-induced mouse NTDs.Copyright © 2022 Wang, Zeng, Pei, He, Liu and Zhang."

Small noncoding RNA (sncRNA) deep sequencing was conducted for sperm samples from the weak (DFI ≥ 30%, n = 13) and normal (DFI ≤ 15%, n = 17) groups.A total of 4939 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified in the weak group sperm samples relative to normal group sperm samples, with 2072 (41.95%) of them located in promoter regions. The percentages of hypermethylated DMRs were higher than those of hypomethylated DMRs in all seven examined gene annotation groups. Hypermethylated DMRs were significantly enriched in terms associated with neurons and microtubules. Compared with the normal group, the global DNA methylation level of the weak group sperm showed a downward trend, with lower correlation for methylation in the weak group sperm; therefore, the chromosomes of high-DFI sperm may be loose. On average, 40.5% of sncRNAs were annotated as rsRNAs, 19.3% as tsRNAs, 10.4% as yRNAs, and 7.1% as miRNAs. A total of 27 miRNAs, 151 tsRNAs, and 70 rsRNAs were differentially expressed between the two groups of sperm samples. Finally, 7 sncRNAs were identified as candidate sperm quality biomarkers, and the target genes of the differentially expressed miRNAs are involved in nervous system development.Our findings suggest that genome-wide DNA methylation profiles and sncRNA signatures are significantly altered in high-DFI sperm. Our study provides potential biomarkers for sperm quality.© 2022. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"36188615","Histone modification and histone modification-targeted anti-cancer drugs in breast cancer: Fundamentals and beyond.","Front Pharmacol","Dysregulated epigenetic enzymes and resultant abnormal epigenetic modifications (EMs) have been suggested to be closely related to tumor occurrence and progression. Histone modifications (HMs) can assist in maintaining genome stability, DNA repair, transcription, and chromatin modulation within breast cancer (BC) cells. In addition, HMs are reversible, dynamic processes involving the associations of different enzymes with molecular compounds. Abnormal HMs (e.g. histone methylation and histone acetylation) have been identified to be tightly related to BC occurrence and development, even though their underlying mechanisms remain largely unclear. EMs are reversible, and as a result, epigenetic enzymes have aroused wide attention as anti-tumor therapeutic targets. At present, treatments to restore aberrant EMs within BC cells have entered preclinical or clinical trials. In addition, no existing studies have comprehensively analyzed aberrant HMs within BC cells; in addition, HM-targeting BC treatments remain to be further investigated. Histone and non-histone protein methylation is becoming an attractive anti-tumor epigenetic therapeutic target; such methylation-related enzyme inhibitors are under development at present. Consequently, the present work focuses on summarizing relevant studies on HMs related to BC and the possible mechanisms associated with abnormal HMs. Additionally, we also aim to analyze existing therapeutic agents together with those drugs approved and tested through pre-clinical and clinical trials, to assess their roles in HMs. Moreover, epi-drugs that target HMT inhibitors and HDAC inhibitors should be tested in preclinical and clinical studies for the treatment of BC. Epi-drugs that target histone methylation (HMT inhibitors) and histone acetylation (HDAC inhibitors) have now entered clinical trials or are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Therefore, the review covers the difficulties in applying HM-targeting treatments in clinics and proposes feasible approaches for overcoming such difficulties and promoting their use in treating BC cases.Copyright © 2022 Feng and Meng."
"36187922","The synergistic interaction landscape of chromatin regulators reveals their epigenetic regulation mechanisms across five cancer cell lines.","Comput Struct Biotechnol J","Chromatin regulators (CRs) regulate the gene transcription process through combinatorial patterns, which currently remain obscure for pan-cancer. This study identified the interaction of CRs and constructed CR-CR interaction networks across five tumor cell lines. The global interaction analysis revealed that CRs tend to function in synergistically. In addition, common and specific CRs in interaction networks were identified, and the epigenetic processes of these CRs in regulating gene transcription were analyzed. Common CRs have conserved binding sites but cooperate with different partners in multiple tumor cell lines. They also participate in gene transcription regulation, through mediation of different histone modifications (HMs). Specific CRs, ATF2 and PRDM10 were found to distinguish liver cancer samples with different prognosis. PRDM10 participates in gene transcription regulation, by exertion of influence on the DNA methylation level of liver cancer. Through analysis of the edges in the CR-CR interaction networks, it was found EP300-TAF1 has genome-wide distinct signaling patterns, which exhibit different effects on downstream targets. This analysis provides novel insights for the understanding of synergistic mechanism of CRs function, as controllers of gene transcription across cancer types.© 2022 The Authors."

In this study, we aimed to investigate the genomic organization and characterize some of the repetitive DNA sequences in this species. Due to the apomictic propagation, various aneuploid genotypes are found, and here, we analyzed a 2n= 4x + 3 = 39 accession. The physical mapping of Ty1-copiaand Ty3-gypsyretroelements through fluorescencein situhybridization with a global assessment of 5-methylcytosine DNA methylation through immunostaining revealed the genome-wide distribution pattern of retroelements and their association with DNA methylation. Approximately one-third of Ty1-copiasites overlapped or spanned centromeric DAPI-positive heterochromatin, while the centromeric regions and arms of some chromosomes were labeled with Ty3-gypsy. Most of the retroelement sites overlapped with 5-methylcytosine signals, except for some Ty3-gypsyon the arms of chromosomes, which did not overlap with anti-5-mC signals. Universal retrotransposon probes did not distinguish genomes ofC. ciliarisshowing signals in pericentromeric regions of all 39 chromosomes, unlike highly abundant repetitive DNA motifs found in survey genome sequences ofC. ciliarisusing graph-based clustering. The probes developed from RepeatExplorer clusters gave strongin situhybridization signals, mostly in pericentromeric regions of about half of the chromosomes, and we suggested that they differentiate the two ancestral genomes in the allotetraploidC. ciliaris, likely having different repeat sequence variants amplified before the genomes came together in the tetraploid.Copyright © 2022 Rathore, Schwarzacher, Heslop-Harrison, Bhat and Tomaszewska."
"36182950","The phenotypic spectrum and genotype-phenotype correlations in 106 patients with variants in major autism gene CHD8.","Transl Psychiatry","CHD8, a major autism gene, functions in chromatin remodelling and has various roles involving several biological pathways. Therefore, unsurprisingly, previous studies have shown that intellectual developmental disorder with autism and macrocephaly (IDDAM), the syndrome caused by pathogenic variants in CHD8, consists of a broad range of phenotypic abnormalities. We collected and reviewed 106 individuals with IDDAM, including 36 individuals not previously published, thus enabling thorough genotype-phenotype analyses, involving the CHD8 mutation spectrum, characterization of the CHD8 DNA methylation episignature, and the systematic analysis of phenotypes collected in Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO). We identified 29 unique nonsense, 25 frameshift, 24 missense, and 12 splice site variants. Furthermore, two unique inframe deletions, one larger deletion (exons 26-28), and one translocation were observed. Methylation analysis was performed for 13 patients, 11 of which showed the previously established episignature for IDDAM (85%) associated with CHD8 haploinsufficiency, one analysis was inconclusive, and one showing a possible gain-of-function signature instead of the expected haploinsufficiency signature was observed. Consistent with previous studies, phenotypical abnormalities affected multiple organ systems. Many neurological abnormalities, like intellectual disability (68%) and hypotonia (29%) were observed, as well as a wide variety of behavioural abnormalities (88%). Most frequently observed behavioural problems included autism spectrum disorder (76%), short attention span (32%), abnormal social behaviour (31%), sleep disturbance (29%) and impaired social interactions (28%). Furthermore, abnormalities in the digestive (53%), musculoskeletal (79%) and genitourinary systems (18%) were noted. Although no significant difference in severity was observed between males and females, individuals with a missense variant were less severely affected. Our study provides an extensive review of all phenotypic abnormalities in patients with IDDAM and provides clinical recommendations, which will be of significant value to individuals with a pathogenic variant in CHD8, their families, and clinicians as it gives a more refined insight into the clinical and molecular spectrum of IDDAM, which is essential for accurate care and counselling.© 2022.

In contrast, STS are relatively common in canine companion animals. Thus, incorporation of veterinary patients into studies of UPS offers an exciting opportunity to develop novel therapeutic strategies for this rare human disease. Genome-wide studies have demonstrated that UPS is characterized by aberrant patterns of DNA methylation. However, the mechanisms and impact of this epigenetic modification on UPS biology and clinical behavior are poorly understood.DNA methylation in mammalian cells is catalyzed by the canonical DNA methyltransferases DNMT1, DNMT3A and DNMT3B. Therefore, we leveraged cell lines and tissue specimens from human and canine patients, together with an orthotopic murine model, to probe the functional and clinical significance of DNMTs in UPS.We found that the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B is overexpressed in UPS relative to normal mesenchymal tissues and is associated with a poor prognosis. Consistent with these findings, genetic DNMT3B depletion strongly inhibited UPS cell proliferation and tumor progression. However, existing hypomethylating agents, including the clinically approved drug 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC) and the DNMT3B-inhibiting tool compound nanaomycin A, were ineffective in UPS due to cellular uptake and toxicity issues.DNMT3B represents a promising molecular susceptibility in UPS, but further development of DNMT3B-targeting strategies for these patients is required.© 2022.

However, other heritable factors such as epigenetic DNA methylation could play a role in neurological changes after stroke.We performed a three-stage epigenome-wide association study to evaluate DNA methylation associated with the difference between the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) at baseline and at discharge (ΔNIHSS) in ischaemic stroke patients. DNA methylation data in the Discovery (n = 643) and Replication (n = 62) Cohorts were interrogated with the 450 K and EPIC BeadChip. Nominal CpG sites from the Discovery (p value < 10-06) were also evaluated in a meta-analysis of the Discovery and Replication cohorts, using a random-fixed effect model. Metabolic pathway enrichment was calculated with methylGSA. We integrated the methylation data with 1305 plasma protein expression levels measured by SOMAscan in 46 subjects and measured RNA expression with RT-PCR in a subgroup of 13 subjects. Specific cell-type methylation was assessed using EpiDISH.The meta-analysis revealed an epigenome-wide significant association in EXOC4 (p value = 8.4 × 10-08) and in MERTK (p value = 1.56 × 10-07). Only the methylation in EXOC4 was also associated in the Discovery and in the Replication Cohorts (p value = 1.14 × 10-06and p value = 1.3 × 10-02, respectively). EXOC4 methylation negatively correlated with the long-term outcome (coefficient = - 4.91) and showed a tendency towards a decrease in EXOC4 expression (rho = - 0.469, p value = 0.091). Pathway enrichment from the meta-analysis revealed significant associations related to the endocytosis and deubiquitination processes. Seventy-nine plasma proteins were differentially expressed in association with EXOC4 methylation. Pathway analysis of these proteins showed an enrichment in natural killer (NK) cell activation. The cell-type methylation analysis in blood also revealed a differential methylation in NK cells.DNA methylation of EXOC4 is associated with a worse neurological course after stroke. The results indicate a potential modulation of pathways involving endocytosis and NK cells regulation.© 2022. The Author(s)."

The median age of participants was > 50 years. Their hearing thresholds were measured using a multilevel pure-tone audiometry assessment. The pure-tone audiometry was calculated at low frequencies (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 kHz), speech frequencies (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 kHz), and high frequencies (4.0 and 8 kHz). The CpG sites were tested using a linear mixed-effects model, and the function of the cis-regulatory regions and ontological enrichments were predicted using the online Genomic Regions Enrichment of Annotations Tool. The differentially methylated regions were identified using a comb-p python library approach.In each of the PTA categories (low-, speech-, high-frequency), age-related hearing loss was detected in 25.9%, 19.3%, and 52.8% of participants. In the low-, speech- and high-frequency categories we identified 18, 42, and 12 individual CpG sites and 6, 11, and 6 differentially methylated regions. The CpG site located near DUSP4 had the strongest association with low- and speech-frequency, while the strongest association with high-frequency was near C21orf58. We identified associations of ALG10 with high-frequency hearing, C3 and LCK with low- and speech-frequency hearing, and GBX2 with low-frequency hearing. Top pathways that may be related to hearing, such as the Notch signaling pathway, were also identified.Our study is the first of its kind to identify these genes and their associated with DNA methylation may play essential roles in the hearing process.

"36179666","Repression and 3D-restructuring resolves regulatory conflicts in evolutionarily rearranged genomes.","Cell","Regulatory landscapes drive complex developmental gene expression, but it remains unclear how their integrity is maintained when incorporating novel genes and functions during evolution. Here, we investigated how a placental mammal-specific gene, Zfp42, emerged in an ancient vertebrate topologically associated domain (TAD) without adopting or disrupting the conserved expression of its gene, Fat1. In ESCs, physical TAD partitioning separates Zfp42 and Fat1 with distinct local enhancers that drive their independent expression. This separation is driven by chromatin activity and not CTCF/cohesin. In contrast, in embryonic limbs, inactive Zfp42 shares Fat1's intact TAD without responding to active Fat1 enhancers. However, neither Fat1 enhancer-incompatibility nor nuclear envelope-attachment account for Zfp42's unresponsiveness. Rather, Zfp42's promoter is rendered inert to enhancers by context-dependent DNA methylation. Thus, diverse mechanisms enabled the integration of independent Zfp42 regulation in the Fat1 locus. Critically, such regulatory complexity appears common in evolution as, genome wide, most TADs contain multiple independently expressed genes.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

"36178606","Nitrogen starvation induces genome-wide activation of transposable elements in Arabidopsis.","J Integr Plant Biol","Nitrogen (N) availability is a major limiting factor for plant growth and agricultural productivity. Although the gene regulation network in response to N starvation has been extensively studied, it remains unknown whether N starvation has an impact on the activity of transposable elements (TEs). Here, we report that TEs can be transcriptionally activated in Arabidopsis under N starvation conditions. Through genetic screening of idm1-14 suppressors, we cloned GLU1, which encodes a glutamate synthase that catalyzes the synthesis of glutamate in the primary N assimilation pathway. We found that GLU1 and its functional homologs GLU2 and GLT1 are redundantly required for TE silencing, suggesting that N metabolism can regulate TE activity. Transcriptome and methylome analyses revealed that N starvation results in genome-wide TE activation without inducing obvious alteration of DNA methylation. Genetic analysis indicated that N starvation-induced TE activation is also independent of other well established epigenetic mechanisms, including histone methylation and heterochromatin decondensation. Our results provide new insights into the regulation of TE activity under stressful environments in planta. This article is protected by copyright.

Also, maternal folate intake is associated with decreased risk of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but the mechanism is not known.We evaluated the relationship between periconceptional folate intake by source and DNA methylation at birth in a cohort of pediatric ALL cases and controls in an epigenome-wide association study.Genome-wide DNA methylation status obtained from archived neonatal blood spots from pediatric ALL cases (n = 189) and controls (n = 205) in the California Childhood Leukemia Study (CCLS) from 1995-2008 was compared to periconceptional folate from total, food, and supplemental sources using multivariable linear regression. Further stratification was performed by income, education, ethnicity, and total folate intake. We evaluated variable DNA methylation response to periconceptional folate by ALL case status through an interaction term.Two significant differentially methylated probes (DMPs) were associated with food and supplemental periconceptional folate intake in all subjects (n = 394). The top differentially methylated region at the promoter region of DUSP22 demonstrated DNA hypermethylation in ALL cases but not controls in response to total and food folate intake. We further identified eight interaction term DMPs with variable DNA methylation response to folate intake by ALL case status. Further stratification of the cohort by education and ethnicity revealed a substantially higher number of DMPs associated with supplemental folic acid intake in Hispanic subjects with lower income and education level.We identified modest associations between periconceptional folate intake and DNA methylation differing by source, including variation by ALL case status.

"36176303","Methylmercury-induced DNA methylation-From epidemiological observations to experimental evidence.","Front Genet","Methylmercury (MeHg) is a developmental neurotoxicant, and one potential mechanism of MeHg toxicity is epigenetic dysregulation. In a recent meta-analysis of epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS), associations between prenatal MeHg exposure and DNA methylation at several genomic sites were identified in blood from newborns and children. While EWASs reveal human-relevant associations, experimental studies are required to validate the relationship between exposure and DNA methylation changes, and to assess if such changes have implications for gene expression. Herein, we studied DNA methylation and gene expression of five of the top genes identified in the EWAS meta-analysis, MED31, MRPL19, GGH, GRK1, and LYSMD3, upon MeHg exposure in human SH-SY5Y cells exposed to 8 or 40 nM of MeHg during differentiation, using bisulfite-pyrosequencing and qPCR, respectively. The concentrations were selected to cover the range of MeHg concentrations in cord blood (2-8.5 μg/L) observed in the cohorts included in the EWAS. Exposure to MeHg increased DNA methylation at MED31, a transcriptional regulator essential for fetal development. The results were in concordance with the epidemiological findings where more MED31 methylation was associated with higher concentrations of MeHg. Additionally, we found a non-significant decrease in DNA methylation at GGH, which corresponds to the direction of change observed in the EWAS, and a significant correlation of GGH methylation with its expression. In conclusion, this study corroborates some of the EWAS findings and puts forward candidate genes involved in MeHg's effects on the developing brain, thus highlighting the value of experimental validation of epidemiological association studies.Copyright © 2022 Cediel-Ulloa, Yu, Hinojosa, Johansson, Forsby, Broberg and Rüegg."

DNA-methylation patterns are significantly altered in all cancer types and can be utilised for disease stratification.Genome-wide DNA methylation (n = 223), gene expression (n = 130), genetic/clinical data (n = 213), whole-exome sequencing (n = 130) was derived from the TARGET study. Methylation data were derived from HumanMethylation450 BeadChip arrays. t-SNE was used for the segregation of molecular subgroups. A separate validation cohort of 105 cases was studied.Five distinct neuroblastoma molecular subgroups were identified, based on genome-wide DNA-methylation patterns, with unique features in each, including three subgroups associated with known prognostic features and two novel subgroups. As expected, Cluster-4 (infant diagnosis) had significantly better 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) than the four other clusters. However, in addition, the molecular subgrouping identified multiple patient subsets with highly increased risk, most notably infant patients that do not map to Cluster-4 (PFS 50% vs 80% for Cluster-4 infants, P = 0.005), and allowed identification of subgroup-specific methylation differences that may reflect important biological differences within neuroblastoma.Methylation-based clustering of neuroblastoma reveals novel molecular subgroups, with distinct molecular/clinical characteristics and identifies a subgroup of higher-risk infant patients.© 2022.

Deciphering such relationships is important for identifying pathogenic processes and developing therapeutics. In the present study, we introduce sc-linker, a framework for integrating single-cell RNA-sequencing, epigenomic SNP-to-gene maps and genome-wide association study summary statistics to infer the underlying cell types and processes by which genetic variants influence disease. The inferred disease enrichments recapitulated known biology and highlighted notable cell-disease relationships, including γ-aminobutyric acid-ergic neurons in major depressive disorder, a disease-dependent M-cell program in ulcerative colitis and a disease-specific complement cascade process in multiple sclerosis. In autoimmune disease, both healthy and disease-dependent immune cell-type programs were associated, whereas only disease-dependent epithelial cell programs were prominent, suggesting a role in disease response rather than initiation. Our framework provides a powerful approach for identifying the cell types and cellular processes by which genetic variants influence disease.© 2022.

The aim of the study was to estimate the occurrence of depression symptoms in a local community with a high deprivation rate, the example being the inhabitants of the JanówLubelski County in eastern Poland. A cross-sectional study was carried out on 3752 people aged between 35 and 64. The prevalence of depression symptoms was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scale. In the screening for depression symptoms in the entire population we studied, the risk of depression symptoms was 16.1% (n= 605), with women having a significantly higher mean score than men (p&lt; 0.001). Significant predictors associated with the achievement of 10 points and more in the PHQ-9 assessment in the case of women and men were: living alone, education and having comorbidities. Moreover, female participants living in rural areas were significantly more likely to exhibit depression symptoms, whereas smoking was a significant predictor of depressive symptoms in men. It was observed that in the case of obese women, the chance of being in the higher category of the PHQ-9 assessment was 1.41 times higher than in women with normal body weight. However, in the case of men, an increase in age by one year increased the chance of being in a higher category by 1.02 times. Moreover, the odds of falling into a higher category, as assessed by the PHQ-9 questionnaire, among men who drink alcohol more than once a week was 1.7 times higher than in men who do not drink or consume alcohol occasionally. Summarising the results of studies conducted in a local community characterised by a high deprivation rate, socioeconomic and health variables related to SES significantly impacted the incidence of depression, but they differ in terms of gender."
"36175966","A blood DNA methylation biomarker for predicting short-term risk of cardiovascular events.","Clin Epigenetics","Recent evidence highlights the epidemiological value of blood DNA methylation (DNAm) as surrogate biomarker for exposure to risk factors for non-communicable diseases (NCD). DNAm surrogate of exposures predicts diseases and longevity better than self-reported or measured exposures in many cases. Consequently, disease prediction models based on blood DNAm surrogates may outperform current state-of-the-art prediction models. This study aims to develop novel DNAm surrogates for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) risk factors and develop a composite biomarker predictive of CVD risk. We compared the prediction performance of our newly developed risk score with the state-of-the-art DNAm risk scores for cardiovascular diseases, the 'next-generation' epigenetic clock DNAmGrimAge, and the prediction model based on traditional risk factors SCORE2.Using data from the EPIC Italy cohort, we derived novel DNAm surrogates for BMI, blood pressure, fasting glucose and insulin, cholesterol, triglycerides, and coagulation biomarkers. We validated them in four independent data sets from Europe and the USA. Further, we derived a DNAmCVDscore predictive of the time-to-CVD event as a combination of several DNAm surrogates. ROC curve analyses show that DNAmCVDscore outperforms previously developed DNAm scores for CVD risk and SCORE2 for short-term CVD risk. Interestingly, the performance of DNAmGrimAge and DNAmCVDscore was comparable (slightly lower for DNAmGrimAge, although the differences were not statistically significant).We described novel DNAm surrogates for CVD risk factors useful for future molecular epidemiology research, and we described a blood DNAm-based composite biomarker, DNAmCVDscore, predictive of short-term cardiovascular events. Our results highlight the usefulness of DNAm surrogate biomarkers of risk factors in epigenetic epidemiology to identify high-risk populations. In addition, we provide further evidence on the effectiveness of prediction models based on DNAm surrogates and discuss methodological aspects for further improvements. Finally, our results encourage testing this approach for other NCD diseases by training and developing DNAm surrogates for disease-specific risk factors and exposures.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"36171872","Potential epigenetic mechanisms in psychotherapy: a pilot study on DNA methylation and mentalization change in borderline personality disorder.","Front Hum Neurosci","Genetic and early environmental factors are interwoven in the etiology of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). Epigenetic mechanisms offer the molecular machinery to adapt to environmental conditions. There are gaps in the knowledge about how epigenetic mechanisms are involved in the effects of early affective environment, development of BPD, and psychotherapy response. We reviewed the available evidence of the effects of psychotherapy on changes in DNA methylation and conducted a pilot study in a sample of 11 female adolescents diagnosed with BPD, exploring for changes in peripheral DNA methylation ofFKBP5gene, which encodes for a stress response protein, in relation to psychotherapy, on symptomatology and underlying psychological processes. For this purpose, measures of early trauma, borderline and depressive symptoms, psychotherapy outcome, mentalization, and emotional regulation were studied. A reduction in the averageFKBP5methylation levels was observed over time. Additionally, the decrease inFKBP5methylation observed occurred only in those individuals who had early trauma and responded to psychotherapy. The results suggest an effect of psychotherapy on epigenetic mechanisms associated with the stress response. The finding that epigenetic changes were only observed in patients with early trauma suggests a specific molecular mechanism of recovery. The results should be taken with caution given the small sample size. Also, further research is needed to adjust for confounding factors and include endocrinological markers and therapeutic process variables.Copyright © 2022 Quevedo, Booij, Herrera, Hernández and Jiménez."

Many solid tumors remain difficult to cure because of tumor-promoting stromal cells, but current therapies targeting tumor stromal cells are constrained by modest efficacy and toxicities. TEM8 is a surface antigen selectively upregulated on tumor and tumor stromal cells, endothelial cells and fibroblasts that may be targeted with specific natural killer (NK) cell engagement.A Tri-specific Killer Engager (TriKE) against TEM8-'cam1615TEM8'-was generated using a mammalian expression system. Its function on NK cells was assessed by evaluation of degranulation, inflammatory cytokine production, and killing against tumor and stroma cell lines in standard co-culture and spheroid assays. cam1615TEM8-mediated proliferation and STAT5 phosphorylation in NK cells was tested and compared with T cells by flow cytometry. NK cell proliferation, tumor infiltration, and tumor and tumor-endothelium killing by cam1615TEM8 and interleukin-15 (IL-15) were assessed in NOD scid gamma (NSG) mice.cam1615TEM8 selectively stimulates NK cell degranulation and inflammatory cytokine production against TEM8-expressing tumor and stromal cell lines. The increased activation translated to superior NK cell killing of TEM8-expressing tumor spheroids. cam1615TEM8 selectively stimulated NK cell but not T cell proliferation in vitro and enhanced NK cell proliferation, survival, and tumor infiltration in vivo. Finally, cam1615TEM8 stimulated NK cell killing of tumor and tumor endothelial cells in vivo.Our findings indicate that the cam1615TEM8 TriKE is a novel anti-tumor, anti-stroma, and anti-angiogenic cancer therapy for patients with solid tumors.

"36155782","SYNPRED: prediction of drug combination effects in cancer using different synergy metrics and ensemble learning.","Gigascience","In cancer research, high-throughput screening technologies produce large amounts of multiomics data from different populations and cell types. However, analysis of such data encounters difficulties due to disease heterogeneity, further exacerbated by human biological complexity and genomic variability. The specific profile of cancer as a disease (or, more realistically, a set of diseases) urges the development of approaches that maximize the effect while minimizing the dosage of drugs. Now is the time to redefine the approach to drug discovery, bringing an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered informational view that integrates the relevant scientific fields and explores new territories.Here, we show SYNPRED, an interdisciplinary approach that leverages specifically designed ensembles of AI algorithms, as well as links omics and biophysical traits to predict anticancer drug synergy. It uses 5 reference models (Bliss, Highest Single Agent, Loewe, Zero Interaction Potency, and Combination Sensitivity Score), which, coupled with AI algorithms, allowed us to attain the ones with the best predictive performance and pinpoint the most appropriate reference model for synergy prediction, often overlooked in similar studies. By using an independent test set, SYNPRED exhibits state-of-the-art performance metrics either in the classification (accuracy, 0.85; precision, 0.91; recall, 0.90; area under the receiver operating characteristic, 0.80; and F1-score, 0.91) or in the regression models, mainly when using the Combination Sensitivity Score synergy reference model (root mean square error, 11.07; mean squared error, 122.61; Pearson, 0.86; mean absolute error, 7.43; Spearman, 0.87). Moreover, data interpretability was achieved by deploying the most current and robust feature importance approaches. A simple web-based application was constructed, allowing easy access by nonexpert researchers.The performance of SYNPRED rivals that of the existing methods that tackle the same problem, yielding unbiased results trained with one of the most comprehensive datasets available (NCI ALMANAC). The leveraging of different reference models allowed deeper insights into which of them can be more appropriately used for synergy prediction. The Combination Sensitivity Score clearly stood out with improved performance among the full scope of surveyed approaches and synergy reference models. Furthermore, SYNPRED takes a particular focus on data interpretability, which has been in the spotlight lately when using the most advanced AI techniques.© The Author(s) 2022.

Following this, we used whole-genome sequencing data from 1060 African American and 100 European American individuals to identify novel variants on a high-risk African American-specific haplotype. We characterized these variants in silico using gene expression and ATAC-seq data from airway epithelial cells, functional annotations from ENCODE, and promoter capture (pc)Hi-C maps in airway epithelial cells. Candidate causal variants were then assessed for correlation with asthma-associated phenotypes in African American children and adults.Our studies revealed nine novel African-specific common variants, enriched on a high-risk asthma haplotype, which regulated the expression of GSDMA in airway epithelial cells and were associated with features of severe asthma. Using ENCODE annotations, ATAC-seq, and pcHi-C, we narrowed the associations to two candidate causal variants that are associated with features of T2 low severe asthma.Previously unknown genetic variation at the 17q12-21 childhood-onset asthma locus contributes to asthma severity in individuals with African ancestries. We suggest that many other population-specific variants that have not been discovered in GWAS contribute to the genetic risk for asthma and other common diseases.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"36167824","Applications of human organoids in the personalized treatment for digestive diseases.","Signal Transduct Target Ther","Digestive system diseases arise primarily through the interplay of genetic and environmental influences; there is an urgent need in elucidating the pathogenic mechanisms of these diseases and deploy personalized treatments. Traditional and long-established model systems rarely reproduce either tissue complexity or human physiology faithfully; these shortcomings underscore the need for better models. Organoids represent a promising research model, helping us gain a more profound understanding of the digestive organs; this model can also be used to provide patients with precise and individualized treatment and to build rapid in vitro test models for drug screening or gene/cell therapy, linking basic research with clinical treatment. Over the past few decades, the use of organoids has led to an advanced understanding of the composition of each digestive organ and has facilitated disease modeling, chemotherapy dose prediction, CRISPR-Cas9 genetic intervention, high-throughput drug screening, and identification of SARS-CoV-2 targets, pathogenic infection. However, the existing organoids of the digestive system mainly include the epithelial system. In order to reveal the pathogenic mechanism of digestive diseases, it is necessary to establish a completer and more physiological organoid model. Combining organoids and advanced techniques to test individualized treatments of different formulations is a promising approach that requires further exploration. This review highlights the advancements in the field of organoid technology from the perspectives of disease modeling and personalized therapy.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"36172073","Integrated bioinformatics analysis reveals that EZH2-rich domains promote transcriptional repression in cervical cancer.","EXCLI J","Cervical cancer is the third female cancer most common worldwide. The carcinogenic process involves an alteration of the mechanisms associated with transcription. Several studies have reported an oncogenic role of the polycomb complex subunit, EZH2. However, the role of EZH2 in cervical cancer is unknown. Hence, the objective of this study was to determine the role of EZH2 in transcriptional regulation in cervical cancer. The EZH2 expression and the methylation status of its promoter were analyzed in The Cancer Genome Atlas. The EZH2 enrichment profile was analyzed using chromatin immunoprecipitation with massively parallel DNA sequencing data provided by ENCODE project. The chromatin compartments were identified in the 4D Nucleome Data Portal. The functional annotation was examined in Enrichr. We report that EZH2 expression is increased in cervical cancer which is associated with hypomethylation of its promoter. EZH2 is enriched at promoter and distal intergenic regions. We identified that EZH2 defines chromatin domains enriched with H3K27me3 within repressive compartments in the HeLa-S3 cell line. Additionally, high EZH2 expression is associated with the repression of the senescent phenotype in cervical cancer patients. Our results suggest the participation of EZH2 in the generation of domains with a silencer function in cervical cancer, which regulate the expression of genes associated with cellular senescence.Copyright © 2022 Salmerón-Bárcenas et al."
"36175844","Circulating miR-181a as a novel potential plasma biomarker for multimorbidity burden in the older population.","BMC Geriatr","Chronic low-level inflammation is thought to play a role in many age-related diseases and to contribute to multimorbidity and to the disability related to this condition. In this framework, inflamma-miRs, an important subset of miRNA able to regulate inflammation molecules, appear to be key players. This study aimed to evaluate plasma levels of the inflamma-miR-181a in relation to age, parameters of health status (clinical, physical, and cognitive) and indices of multimorbidity in a cohort of 244 subjects aged 65- 97.MiR-181a was isolated from plasma according to standardized procedures and its expression levels measured by qPCR. Correlation tests and multivariate regression analyses were applied on gender-stratified groups.MiR-181a levels resulted increased in old men, and significantly correlated with worsened blood parameters of inflammation (such as low levels of albumin and bilirubin and high lymphocyte content), particularly in females. Furthermore, we found miR-181a positively correlated with the overall multimorbidity burden, measured by CIRS Comorbidity Score, in both genders.These data support a role of miR-181a in age-related chronic inflammation and in the development of multimorbidity in older adults and indicate that the routes by which this miRNA influence health status are likely to be gender specific. Based on our results, we suggest that miR-181a is a promising biomarker of health status of the older population.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"36172194","Epigallocatechin-3-gallate: A phytochemical as a promising drug candidate for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.","Front Pharmacol","Epigallocatechin 3-gallate (EGCG), an abundant polyphenolic component derived from green tea extract, possesses versatile bioactivities that can combat many diseases. During the last decade, EGCG was shown to be effective in experimental models of Parkinson's disease (PD). Several experimental studies have suggested that it has pleiotropic neuroprotective effects, which has enhanced the appeal of EGCG as a therapeutic strategy in PD. In this review, we compiled recent updates and knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of EGCG in PD. We focused on the effects of EGCG on apoptosis, oxidative stress, inflammation, ferroptosis, modulation of dopamine production, and the aggregation of α-synuclein. The review highlights the pharmacological features of EGCG and its therapeutic implications in PD. Taken together, the accumulated data indicate that EGCG is a promising neuroprotective compound for the treatment of PD.Copyright © 2022 Wang, Wu, Li, Lang, Li, Jiang, Wan, Chen and Wang."
"36172354","Function and mechanism of histone β-hydroxybutyrylation in health and disease.","Front Immunol","Histone post-translational modifications (HPTMs) are essential epigenetic mechanisms that affect chromatin-associated nuclear processes without altering the DNA sequence. With the application of mass spectrometry-based proteomics, novel histone lysine acylation, such as propionylation, butyrylation, crotonylation, malonylation, succinylation, glutarylation, and lactoylation have been successively discovered. The emerging diversity of the lysine acylation landscape prompted us to investigate the function and mechanism of these novel HPTMs in health and disease. Recently, it has been reported that β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), the main component of the ketone body, has various protective roles beyond alternative fuel provision during starvation. Histone lysine β-hydroxybutyrylation (Kbhb) is a novel HPTMs identified by mass spectrometry, which regulates gene transcription in response to carbohydrate restriction or elevated BHB levelsin vivoandvitro. Recent studies have shown that histone Kbhb is strongly associated with the pathogenesis of metabolic cardiovascular diseases, kidney diseases, tumors, neuropsychiatric disorders, and metabolic diseases suggesting it has different functions from histone acetylation and methylation. This review focuses on the writers, erasers, sites, and underlying functions of histone Kbhb, providing a glimpse into their complex regulation mechanism.Copyright © 2022 Zhou, Cheng, He, Xie, Xu, Xu and Huang."
"36167428","Building in vitro models of the brain to understand the role of <i>APOE</i> in Alzheimer's disease.","Life Sci Alliance","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating, complex, and incurable disease that represents an increasingly problematic global health issue. The etiology of sporadic AD that accounts for a vast majority of cases remains poorly understood, with no effective therapeutic interventions. Genetic studies have identified AD risk genes including the most prominent,APOE, of which the ɛ4 allele increases risk in a dose-dependent manner. A breakthrough discovery enabled the creation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) that can be differentiated into various brain cell types, facilitating AD research in genetically human models. Herein, we provide a brief background on AD in the context ofAPOEsusceptibility and feature work employing hiPSC-derived brain cell and tissue models to interrogate the contribution ofAPOEin driving AD pathology. Such models have delivered crucial insights into cellular mechanisms and cell type-specific roles underlying the perturbed biological functions that trigger pathogenic cascades and propagate neurodegeneration. Collectively, hiPSC-based models are envisioned to be an impactful platform for uncovering fundamental AD understanding, with high translational value toward AD drug discovery and testing.© 2022 Pinals and Tsai."
"36167018","A missense mutation in ISPD contributes to maintain muscle fiber stability.","Poult Sci","Livestock and poultry skeletal muscle development was regulated by a variety of genetic factors playing an essential role in this process. In our de novo sequencing, a missense mutation in ISPD exon 2 showed a selected signature for well-developed muscles. However, the relationship between this mutation and muscle phenotypes remains unclear.Based on the genotype bias of this missense mutation in gamecock chickens, we compared the cross-section of muscle fibers among the individuals with different genotypes with the results showing a genotype preference of this missense mutation in the chickens with hypertrophic muscle fibers. Comparing TT- and CC-genotype ISPD showed that TT- genotype was associated with heavier skeletal muscle and a better effect on myogenesis and myofiber stability. At cellular level, ISPD was identified to inhibit myoblast proliferation, differentiation and antagonize of muscular atrophy.It can be concluded that the missense mutation of Arg84Lys in ISPD was associated with well-developed muscles and demonstrated to improve chicken muscles' development.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

"36175944","Effective hybrid feature selection using different bootstrap enhances cancers classification performance.","BioData Min","Machine learning can be used to predict the different onset of human cancers. Highly dimensional data have enormous, complicated problems. One of these is an excessive number of genes plus over-fitting, fitting time, and classification accuracy. Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) is a wrapper method for selecting the best subset of features that cause the best accuracy. Despite the high performance of RFE, time computation and over-fitting are two disadvantages of this algorithm. Random forest for selection (RFS) proves its effectiveness in selecting the effective features and improving the over-fitting problem.This paper proposed a method, namely, positions first bootstrap step (PFBS) random forest selection recursive feature elimination (RFS-RFE) and its abbreviation is PFBS- RFS-RFE to enhance cancer classification performance. It used a bootstrap with many positions included in the outer first bootstrap step (OFBS), inner first bootstrap step (IFBS), and outer/ inner first bootstrap step (O/IFBS). In the first position, OFBS is applied as a resampling method (bootstrap) with replacement before selection step. The RFS is applied with bootstrap = false i.e., the whole datasets are used to build each tree. The importance features are hybrid with RFE to select the most relevant subset of features. In the second position, IFBS is applied as a resampling method (bootstrap) with replacement during applied RFS. The importance features are hybrid with RFE. In the third position, O/IFBS is applied as a hybrid of first and second positions. RFE used logistic regression (LR) as an estimator. The proposed methods are incorporated with four classifiers to solve the feature selection problems and modify the performance of RFE, in which five datasets with different size are used to assess the performance of the PFBS-RFS-RFE.The results showed that the O/IFBS-RFS-RFE achieved the best performance compared with previous work and enhanced the accuracy, variance and ROC area for RNA gene and dermatology erythemato-squamous diseases datasets to become 99.994%, 0.0000004, 1.000 and 100.000%, 0.0 and 1.000, respectively.High dimensional datasets and RFE algorithm face many troubles in cancers classification performance. PFBS-RFS-RFE is proposed to fix these troubles with different positions. The importance features which extracted from RFS are used with RFE to obtain the effective features.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Recent epidemiological reports confirm this link and raise concern that elevated chromosomal congenital anomaly rates (CCAR) may be occurring in Europe which is experiencing increased cannabis use, daily intensity of use and cannabinoid potency.CCAR data from Eurocat. Drug use data from the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction. Income from World Bank. Bivariate, multivariate, panel and geotemporospatial regressions analyzed. Inverse probability weighting of panel models and E-values used as major quantitative causal inferential methodologies.In countries where daily cannabis use was rising the trend for CCA's was upwards whereas in those where daily use was declining it was usually downwards (p= 0.0002). In inverse probability weighted panel models terms for cannabis metrics were significant for chromosomal disorders, trisomies 21 and 13 and Klinefelters syndrome fromp&lt; 2.2 × 10-16. In spatiotemporal models cannabis terms were positive and significant for chromosomal disorders, genetic disorders, trisomies 21, 18 and 13, Turners and Klinefelters syndromes from 4.28 × 10-6, 5.79 × 10-12, 1.26 × 10-11, 1.12 × 10-7, 7.52 × 10-9, 7.19 × 10-7and 7.27 × 10-7. 83.7% of E-value estimates and 74.4% of minimum E-values (mEV) &gt; 9 including four values each at infinity.
