"37671241","RgnTX: Colocalization analysis of transcriptome elements in the presence of isoform heterogeneity and ambiguity.","Comput Struct Biotechnol J","Colocalization analysis of genomic region sets has been widely adopted to unveil potential functional interactions between corresponding biological attributes, which often serves as the basis for further investigation. A number of methods have been developed for colocalization analysis of genomic elements. However, none of them explicitly considered the transcriptome heterogeneity and isoform ambiguity, making them less appropriate for analyzing transcriptome elements. Here, we developed RgnTX, an R/Bioconductor tool for the colocalization analysis of transcriptome elements with permutation tests. Different from existing approaches, RgnTX directly takes advantage of transcriptome annotation, and offers high flexibility in the null model to simulate realistic transcriptome-wide background, such as the complex alternative splicing patterns. Importantly, it supports the testing of transcriptome elements without clear isoform association, which is often the real scenario due to technical limitations. Proposed package offers a wide selection of pre-defined functions, easy to be utilized by users for visualizing permutation results, calculating shifted z-scores and conducting multiple hypothesis testing under Benjamini-Hochberg correction. Moreover, with synthetic and real datasets, we show that RgnTX novel testing modes return distinct and more significant results compared to existing genome-based methods. We believe RgnTX should make a useful tool to characterize the randomness of the transcriptome, and for conducting statistical association analysis for genomic region sets within the heterogeneous transcriptome. The package now has been accepted by Bioconductor and is freely available at: https://bioconductor.org/packages/RgnTX.© 2023 The Authors."
"37669386","TET3-mediated DNA oxidation is essential for intestinal epithelial cell response to stressors.","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","DNA methylation functions as a repressive epigenetic mark that can be reversed by the Ten-eleven translocation (TET) family of DNA dioxygenases that sequentially oxidize 5-methylcytosine into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC), and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC). Both 5fC and 5caC can be excised by DNA base-excision repair factors leading to unmodified cytosines. TET enzymes were recently implicated as potential risk factors for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but the contribution of TET-mediated DNA oxidation to intestinal homeostasis and response to environmental stressors are unknown. Here, we show prominent roles of TET3 in regulating mouse intestinal epithelial differentiation and response to luminal stressors. Compared with wild-type littermates, mice with intestinal epithelial cell-specific ablation ofTet3(Tet3ΔIEC) demonstrated a decreased transcriptome involved in innate immune response, Paneth cell differentiation, and epithelial regeneration.Tet3IECmice exhibited an elevated susceptibility to enteric pathogen infection that is correlated with a decreased epithelial 5hmC abundance. Infection of human enterocytes or mice with the pathogenic bacteria acutely increased 5hmC abundance. Genome-wide 5hmC profiling revealed a shift of genomic enrichment of 5hmC toward genes involved in activating Notch, Wnt, and autophagy pathways. Furthermore, chemical stressor dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) represses epithelial 5hmC abundance in a temporal fashion, andTet3IECmice exhibited increased susceptibility to DSS experimental colitis with reduced regenerative capacity. TET3 is a critical regulator of gut epithelial DNA methylome and transcriptome, especially in response to luminal stressors, for the maintenance of tissue homeostasis."
"37667288","Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of Astragalus and Danshen on the intervention of myofibroblast activation in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.","BMC Pulm Med","Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a chronic progressive interstitial lung disease of unknown etiology, is characterized by continuous damage to alveolar epithelial cells, abnormal repair of alveolar tissue, and alveolar wall scar formation. Currently, the recommended treatment for IPF in Western medicine is relatively limited. In contrast, traditional Chinese medicine and compound prescriptions show advantages in the diagnosis and treatment of IPF, which can be attributed to their multi-channel and multi-target characteristics and minimal side-effects. The purpose of this study was to further corroborate the effectiveness and significance of the traditional Chinese medications Astragalus and Danshen in IPF treatment.We performed whole-genome methylation analysis on nine rat lung tissue samples to determine the epigenetic variation between IPF and non-fibrotic lungs using Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analyses and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions.We identified differentially methylated regions and 105 associated key functional genes in samples related to IPF and Chinese medicine treatment. Based on the methylation levels and gene expression profiles between the Chinese medicine intervention and pulmonary fibrosis model groups, we speculated that Astragalus and Salvia miltiorrhiza (traditionally known as Danshen) act on the Isl1, forkhead box O3, and Sonic hedgehog genes via regulation at transcriptional and epigenetic levels during IPF.These findings provide novel insights into the epigenetic regulation of IPF, indicate the effectiveness of Astragalus and Danshen in treating IPF, and suggest several promising therapeutic targets for preventing and treating IPF.© 2023.

"37664790","Genome- and Exome-Wide Association Studies Revealed Candidate Genes Associated with DaTscan Imaging Features.","Parkinsons Dis","Despite remarkable progress in identifying Parkinson's disease (PD) genetic risk loci, the genetic basis of PD remains largely unknown. With the help of the endophenotype approach and using data from dopamine transporter single-photon emission computerized tomography (DaTscan), we identified potentially involved genes in PD.We conducted an imaging genetic study by performing exome-wide association study (EWAS) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) on the specific binding ratio (SBR) of six DaTscan anatomical areas between 489 and 559 subjects of Parkinson's progression markers initiative (PPMI) cohort and 83,623 and 36,845 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)/insertion-deletion mutations (INDELs). We also investigated the association of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein concentration of our significant genes with PD progression using PPMI CSF proteome data.Among 83,623 SNPs/INDELs in EWAS, one SNP (rs201465075) on 1 q32.1 locus was significantly (Pvalue = 4.03 × 10-7) associated with left caudate DaTscan SBR, and 33 SNPs were suggestive. Among 36,845 SNPs in GWAS, one SNP (rs12450112) on 17 p.12 locus was significantly (Pvalue = 1.34 × 10-6) associated with right anterior putamen DaTscan SBR, and 39 SNPs were suggestive among which 8 SNPs were intergenic. We found that rs201465075 and rs12450112 are most likely related toIGFN1andMAP2K4genes. The protein level ofMAP2K4in the CSF was significantly associated with PD progression in the PPMI cohort; however, proteomic data were not available for theIGFN1gene.We have shown that particular variants ofIGFN1andMAP2K4genes may be associated with PD. Since DaTscan imaging could be positive in other Parkinsonian syndromes, caution should be taken when interpreting our results. Future experimental studies are also needed to verify these findings.Copyright © 2023 Arash Yaghoobi et al."
"37664245","Longitudinal early epigenomic signatures inform molecular paths of therapy response and remission in depressed patients.","Front Mol Neurosci","The etiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) involves the interaction between genes and environment, including treatment. Early molecular signatures for treatment response and remission are relevant in a context of personalized medicine and stratification and reduce the time-to-decision. Therefore, we focused the analyses on patients that responded or remitted following a cognitive intervention of 8 weeks.We used data from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with MDD patients (N= 112) receiving a cognitive intervention. At baseline and 8 weeks, blood for DNA methylation (Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC 850k BeadChip) was collected, as well as MADRS. First, responders (N= 24; MADRS-reduction of at least 50%) were compared with non-responders (N= 60). Then, we performed longitudinal within-individual analyses, for response (N= 21) and for remission (N= 18; MADRS smaller or equal to 9 and higher than 9 at baseline), respectively, as well as patients with no change in MADRS over time. At 8 weeks the sample comprised 84 individuals; 73 patients had DNA methylation for both time-points. The RnBeads package (R) was used for data cleaning, quality control, and differential DNA-methylation (limma). The within-individual paired longitudinal analysis was performed using Welch'st-test. Subsequently gene-ontology (GO) pathway analyses were performed.No CpG was genome-wide significant CpG (p< 5 × 10-8). The most significant CpG in the differential methylation analysis comparing response versus non-response was in theIQSEC1gene (cg01601845;p= 1.53 × 10-6), linked to neurotransmission. The most significant GO-terms were linked to telomeres. The longitudinal response analysis returned 67 GO pathways with ap< 0.05. Two of the three most significant pathways were linked to sodium transport. The analysis for remission returned 46 GO terms with ap-value smaller than 0.05 with pathways linked to phosphatase regulation and synaptic functioning. The analysis with stable patients returned mainly GO-terms linked to basic cellular processes.Our result suggest that DNA methylation can be suitable to capture early signs of treatment response and remission following a cognitive intervention in depression. Despite not being genome-wide significant, the CpG locations and GO-terms returned by our analysis comparing patients with and without cognitive impairment, are in line with prior knowledge on pathways and genes relevant for depression treatment and cognition. Our analysis provides new hypotheses for the understanding of how treatment for depression can act through DNA methylation and induce response and remission.Copyright © 2023 Van Assche, Hohoff, Zang, Knight and Baune."
"37662315","Evolution of parent-of-origin effects on placental gene expression in house mice.","bioRxiv","The mammalian placenta is a hotspot for the evolution of genomic imprinting, a form of gene regulation that involves the parent-specific epigenetic silencing of one allele. Imprinted genes are central to placental development and are thought to contribute to the evolution of reproductive barriers between species. However, it is unclear how rapidly imprinting evolves or how functional specialization among placental tissues influences the evolution of imprinted expression. We compared parent-of-origin expression bias across functionally distinct placental layers sampled from reciprocal crosses within three closely related lineages of mice (Mus). Using genome-wide gene expression and DNA methylation data from fetal and maternal tissues, we developed an analytical strategy to minimize pervasive bias introduced by maternal contamination of placenta samples. We corroborated imprinted expression at 42 known imprinted genes and identified five candidate imprinted genes showing parent-of-origin specific expression and DNA methylation. Paternally-biased expression was enriched in the labyrinth zone, a layer specialized in nutrient transfer, and maternally-biased genes were enriched in the junctional zone, which specializes in modulation of maternal physiology. Differentially methylated regions were predominantly determined through epigenetic modification of the maternal genome and were associated with both maternally- and paternally-biased gene expression. Lastly, comparisons between lineages revealed a small set of co-regulated genes showing rapid divergence in expression levels and imprinted status in theM. m. domesticuslineage. Together, our results reveal important links between core functional elements of placental biology and the evolution of imprinted gene expression among closely related rodent species."

Single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing technique has longer read-length sequences, more accuracy, and the ability to identify epigenetic DNA alterations.This study applied SMRT technology to sequence a clinical strainP. aeruginosaPA3 to obtain its genome sequence and methylation modification information. Genomic, comparative, pan-genomic, and epigenetic analyses of PA3 were conducted.General genome annotations of PA3 were discovered, as well as information about virulence factors, regulatory proteins (RPs), secreted proteins, type II toxin-antitoxin (TA) pairs, and genomic islands. A genome-wide comparison revealed that PA3 was comparable to otherP. aeruginosastrains in terms of identity, but varied in areas of horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Phylogenetic analysis showed that PA3 was closely related toP. aeruginosa60503 andP. aeruginosa8380.P. aeruginosa's pan-genome consists of a core genome of roughly 4,300 genes and an accessory genome of at least 5,500 genes. The results of the epigenetic analysis identified one main methylation sites, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) and 1 motif (CATNNNNNNNTCCT/AGGANNNNNNNATG). 16 meaningful methylated sites were picked. Among these,purH,phaZ, andlexAare of great significance playing an important role in the drug resistance and biological environment adaptability of PA3, and the targeting of these genes may benefit further antibacterial studies.This study provided a detailed visualization and DNA methylation information of the PA3 genome and set a foundation for subsequent research into the molecular mechanism of DNA methyltransferase-controlledP. aeruginosapathogenicity.Copyright © 2023 Li, Zhou, Liao, Liu, Zhao, Wang, Zhong, Zeng, Peng, Tan and Yang."

So far mostly invasive methodologies such as biopsies have been applied towards collecting DNA methylation signatures. Tape-stripping offers a non-invasive option for skin diagnostics. It enables the easy but robust capture biological material, in large numbers of participants without the need for specialized medical personnel.To design and validate a methodology for non-invasive skin sample collection using tape-stripping for subsequent DNA methylation analysis.A total of 175 participants were recruited and provided tape-stripping samples from a sun-exposed area, 92 of those provided matched tape-stripping samples from a sun-protected area, and an additional 5 provided matched skin-shave biopsies from the same area. Using enzymatic conversion and whole genome Illumina sequencing, we generated genome-wide DNA methylation profiles which we used to evaluate the feasibility of non-invasive data acquisition, to compare with established sampling approaches and to investigate biomarker identification for age and UV exposure.We found that tape-stripping samples show strong concordance in their global DNA methylation landscapes with those of conventional invasive biopsies. Moreover, we show sample reproducibility and consistent global methylation profiles in skin tape-stripping samples collected from different parts of the body. Using matched samples from sun-protected and sun-exposed areas of the body we were able to validate the capacity of our method to capture the effects of environmental changes and aging from a cohort covering various ages, ethnicities, and skin types. We present DNA methylation changes on the skin resulting from UV exposure and identify a significant age-related hypermethylation of CpG islands, with a pronounced peak effect at 50-55 years of age, including methylation changes in well-described markers of aging.These data demonstrate the feasibility of using tape-stripping combined with whole genome sequencing as a non-invasive approach to measure DNA methylation changes in the skin. In addition, they outline a viable experimental framework for the use of skin tape-stripping, particularly when that is performed in large cohorts of patients to identify biomarkers of skin aging, UV damage, and possibly to track treatment response to therapeutic interventions.© The Author(s) 2023.

However, the role of m6A methylation on circRNAs in amphibians remains unknown. In this study, we conducted m6A sequencing analysis to explore the m6A transcriptome-wide profile of circRNAs in testis tissues of Xenopus laevis (X. laevis) with and without treatment with 100 µg/L atrazine (AZ).The analysis showed that m6A modification of circRNAs enriched in sense overlapping in testes of X. laevis. We identified the differential m6A modification sites within circRNAs in testes of AZ-exposed X. laevis and compared that with animals from control group. The results showed that a total of 1507 methylated m6A sites was induced by AZ (760 up-methylated and 747 down-methylated). The cross-analysis exhibited a negative correlation of differentially methylated m6A peaks and circRNAs expression level. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis indicated that 20 key pathways may be involved in the mechanism of testis damage of AZ-exposed X. laevis.These findings indicated that differentially m6A-methylated circRNAs may play important roles in abnormal testis development of AZ-exposed X. laevis.

"37658413","METTL3-induced lncRNA GBAP1 promotes hepatocellular carcinoma progression by activating BMP/SMAD pathway.","Biol Direct","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common and challenging cancers in the world. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play critical roles in the progression of HCC. However, there are few reports on genome-wide screening and functional annotations of m6A-methylated lncRNAs in HCC.The expression levels of m6A methyltransferase METTL3 and the association with the prognosis in HCC were determined by RT-qPCR, public dataset platforms. Then, RNA-seq, Pearson correlation analysis, MeRIP-qPCR, RNA half-life assay, gene site-directed mutation, RIP assay and RT-qPCR analysis were employed to determine the downstream target of METTL3 in HCC. Subsequently, the expression levels and roles of lncRNA glucosylceramidase beta pseudogene 1 (GBAP1) in HCC were determined by Kaplan-meier curves, RT-qPCR, in vitro functional experiments and in vivo tumorigenesis and lung metastasis models. Then, the downstream target and pathway of GBAP1 were explored by GO biological process, KEGG pathway enrichment, luciferase reporter assay, RIP assay and rescue experiments and so on.METTL3 was upregulated in HCC and closely related to HCC prognosis. And METTL3 induced GBAP1 expression by acting as the m6A writer of GBAP1 and IGF2BP2 worked as its m6A reader. Clinically, GBAP1 expression was significantly associated with tumor size, venous infiltration, TNM stage and prognosis of HCC, Functionally, GBAP1 promoted HCC metastasis and growth both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, GBAP1 acted as the molecular sponge for miR-22-3p to increase the expression of bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 1A (BMPR1A), which then activated BMP/SMAD pathway in HCC cells.Our findings demonstrated that METTL3-induced GBAP1 promoted migration, invasion and proliferation of HCC cells via GBAP1/miR-22-3p/BMPR1A/SMAD axis.

Features may include hypoplastic nails, slow growth, characteristic facial features, hypotonia, hypertrichosis, and sparse scalp hair. Most reported cases are due to ARID1B loss of function variants. We report a boy with developmental delay, feeding difficulties, aspiration, recurrent respiratory infections, slow growth, and hypotonia without a clinical diagnosis, where a previously unreported ARID1B missense variant was classified as a variant of uncertain significance. The pathogenicity of this variant was refined through combined methodologies including genome-wide methylation signature analysis (EpiSign), Machine Learning (ML) facial phenotyping, and LIRICAL. Trio exome sequencing and EpiSign were performed. ML facial phenotyping compared facial images using FaceMatch and GestaltMatcher to syndrome-specific libraries to prioritize the trio exome bioinformatic pipeline gene list output. Phenotype-driven variant prioritization was performed with LIRICAL. A de novo heterozygous missense variant, ARID1B p.(Tyr1268His), was reported as a variant of uncertain significance. The ACMG classification was refined to likely pathogenic by a supportive methylation signature, ML facial phenotyping, and prioritization through LIRICAL.

Nevertheless, the evolution of the 6mA methylation of homologous genes after species and after gene duplications remains unclear in plants. To understand the evolution of 6mA methylation, we detected the genome-wide 6mA methylation patterns of four lotus plants (Nelumbo nucifera) from different geographic origins by nanopore sequencing and compared them to patterns inArabidopsisand rice. Within lotus, the genomic distributions of 6mA sites are different from the widely studied 5mC methylation sites. Consistently, in lotus,Arabidopsisand rice, 6mA sites are enriched around transcriptional start sites, positively correlated with gene expression levels, and preferentially retained in highly and broadly expressed orthologs with longer gene lengths and more exons. Among different duplicate genes, 6mA methylation is significantly more enriched and conserved in whole-genome duplicates than in local duplicates. Overall, our study reveals the convergent patterns of 6mA methylation evolution based on both lineage and duplicate gene divergence, which underpin their potential role in gene regulatory evolution in plants."

"37652023","Blood-based genome-wide DNA methylation correlations across body-fat- and adiposity-related biochemical traits.","Am J Hum Genet","The recent increase in obesity levels across many countries is likely to be driven by nongenetic factors. The epigenetic modification DNA methylation (DNAm) may help to explore this, as it is sensitive to both genetic and environmental exposures. While the relationship between DNAm and body-fat traits has been extensively studied, there is limited literature on the shared associations of DNAm variation across such traits. Akin to genetic correlation estimates, here, we introduce an approach to evaluate the similarities in DNAm associations between traits: DNAm correlations. As DNAm can be both a cause and consequence of complex traits, DNAm correlations have the potential to provide insights into trait relationships above that currently obtained from genetic and phenotypic correlations. Utilizing 7,519 unrelated individuals from Generation Scotland with DNAm from the EPIC array, we calculated DNAm correlations between body-fat- and adiposity-related traits by using the bivariate OREML framework in the OSCA software. For each trait, we also estimated the shared contribution of DNAm between sexes. We identified strong, positive DNAm correlations between each of the body-fat traits (BMI, body-fat percentage, and waist-to-hip ratio, ranging from 0.96 to 1.00), finding larger associations than those identified by genetic and phenotypic correlations. We identified a significant deviation from 1 in the DNAm correlations for BMI between males and females, with sex-specific DNAm changes associated with BMI identified at eight DNAm probes. Employing genome-wide DNAm correlations to evaluate the similarities in the associations of DNAm with complex traits has provided insight into obesity-related traits beyond that provided by genetic correlations.Copyright © 2023 American Society of Human Genetics.

We present MeDeMo, a toolbox for TF motif analysis that combines information about DNA methylation with models capturing intra-motif dependencies. In a large-scale study using ChIP-seq data for 335 TFs, we identify novel TFs that show a binding behaviour associated with DNA methylation. Overall, we find that the presence of CpG methylation decreases the likelihood of binding for the majority of methylation-associated TFs. For a considerable subset of TFs, we show that intra-motif dependencies are pivotal for accurately modelling the impact of DNA methylation on TF binding. We illustrate that the novel methylation-aware TF binding models allow to predict differential ChIP-seq peaks and improve the genome-wide analysis of TF binding. Our work indicates that simplistic models that neglect the effect of DNA methylation on DNA binding may lead to systematic underperformance for methylation-associated TFs.© The Author(s) 2023.

"37650637","A genetic screen identifies BEND3 as a regulator of bivalent gene expression and global DNA methylation.","Nucleic Acids Res","Epigenetic mechanisms are essential to establish and safeguard cellular identities in mammals. They dynamically regulate the expression of genes, transposable elements and higher-order chromatin structures. Consequently, these chromatin marks are indispensable for mammalian development and alterations often lead to disease, such as cancer. Bivalent promoters are especially important during differentiation and development. Here we used a genetic screen to identify new regulators of a bivalent repressed gene. We identify BEND3 as a regulator of hundreds of bivalent promoters, some of which it represses, and some of which it activates. We show that BEND3 is recruited to a CpG-containg consensus site that is present in multiple copies in many bivalent promoters. Besides having direct effect on the promoters it binds, the loss of BEND3 leads to genome-wide gains of DNA methylation, which are especially marked at regions normally protected by the TET enzymes. DNA hydroxymethylation is reduced in Bend3 mutant cells, possibly as consequence of altered gene expression leading to diminished alpha-ketoglutarate production, thus lowering TET activity. Our results clarify the direct and indirect roles of an important chromatin regulator, BEND3, and, more broadly, they shed light on the regulation of bivalent promoters.© The Author(s) 2023.

Aberrant cell-free DNA (cfDNA) methylation signatures are a promising tool for detecting ESCC. However, available markers based on cell-free DNA methylation are still inadequate. This study aimed to identify ESCC-specific cfDNA methylation markers and evaluate the diagnostic performance in the early detection of ESCC.We performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) for 24 ESCC tissues and their normal adjacent tissues. Based on the WGBS data, we identified 21,469,837 eligible CpG sites (CpGs). By integrating several methylation datasets, we identified several promising ESCC-specific cell-free DNA methylation markers. Finally, we developed a dual-marker panel based on methylated KCNA3 and OTOP2, and then, we evaluated its performance in our training and validation cohorts.The ESCC diagnostic model constructed based on KCNA3 and OTOP2 had an AUC of 0.91 [95% CI: 0.85-0.95], and an optimal sensitivity and specificity of 84.91% and 94.32%, respectively, in the training cohort. In the independent validation cohort, the AUC was 0.88 [95% CI: 0.83-0.92], along with an optimal sensitivity of 81.5% and specificity of 92.9%. The model sensitivity for stage I-II ESCC was 78.4%, which was slightly lower than the sensitivity of the model (85.7%) for stage III-IV ESCC.The dual-target panel based on cfDNA showed excellent performance for detecting ESCC and might be an alternative strategy for screening ESCC.Copyright © 2023 The Chinese Medical Association, produced by Wolters Kluwer, Inc. under the CC-BY-NC-ND license."

We aim to identify epigenetic marks in offspring associated with father's preconception smoking.We conducted epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) in the RHINESSA cohort (7-50 years) on father's any preconception smoking (n = 875 offspring) and father's pubertal onset smoking < 15 years (n = 304), using Infinium MethylationEPIC Beadchip arrays, adjusting for offspring age, own smoking and maternal smoking. EWAS of maternal and offspring personal smoking were performed for comparison. Father's smoking-associated dmCpGs were checked in subpopulations of offspring who reported no personal smoking and no maternal smoking exposure.Father's smoking commencing preconception was associated with methylation of blood DNA in offspring at two cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites (CpGs) (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05) in PRR5 and CENPP. Father's pubertal onset smoking was associated with 19 CpGs (FDR < 0.05) mapped to 14 genes (TLR9, DNTT, FAM53B, NCAPG2, PSTPIP2, MBIP, C2orf39, NTRK2, DNAJC14, CDO1, PRAP1, TPCN1, IRS1 and CSF1R). These differentially methylated sites were hypermethylated and associated with promoter regions capable of gene silencing. Some of these sites were associated with offspring outcomes in this cohort including ever-asthma (NTRK2), ever-wheezing (DNAJC14, TPCN1), weight (FAM53B, NTRK2) and BMI (FAM53B, NTRK2) (p < 0.05). Pathway analysis showed enrichment for gene ontology pathways including regulation of gene expression, inflammation and innate immune responses. Father's smoking-associated sites did not overlap with dmCpGs identified in EWAS of personal and maternal smoking (FDR < 0.05), and all sites remained significant (p < 0.05) in analyses of offspring with no personal smoking and no maternal smoking exposure.Father's preconception smoking, particularly in puberty, is associated with offspring DNA methylation, providing evidence that epigenetic mechanisms may underlie epidemiological observations that pubertal paternal smoking increases risk of offspring asthma, low lung function and obesity.© 2023.

"37648910","MLACNN: an attention mechanism-based CNN architecture for predicting genome-wide DNA methylation.","Theory Biosci","Methylation is an important epigenetic regulation of methylation genes that plays a crucial role in regulating biological processes. While traditional methods for detecting methylation in biological experiments are constantly improving, the development of artificial intelligence has led to the emergence of deep learning and machine learning methods as a new trend. However, traditional machine learning-based methods rely heavily on manual feature extraction, and most deep learning methods for studying methylation extract fewer features due to their simple network structures. To address this, we propose a bottomneck network based on an attention mechanism and use new methods to ensure that the deep network can learn more effective features while minimizing overfitting. This approach enables the model to learn more features from nucleotide sequences and make better predictions of methylation. The model uses three coding methods to encode the original DNA sequence and then applies feature fusion based on attention mechanisms to obtain the best fusion method. Our results demonstrate that MLACNN outperforms previous methods and achieves more satisfactory performance.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Subsequent gene expression profiling (n = 120) revealed changes in cytokine and interferon signal transduction in ZNF217-aberrant PMBCL cases. In vitro, knockout of ZNF217 led to changes in chromatin accessibility interfering with binding motifs for crucial lymphoma-associated transcription factors. This led to disturbed expression of interferon-responsive and inflammation-associated genes, altered cell behavior, and aberrant differentiation. Mass spectrometry demonstrates that ZNF217 acts within a histone modifier complex containing LSD1, CoREST and HDAC and interferes with H3K4 methylation and H3K27 acetylation. Concluding, our data suggest non-catalytic activity of ZNF217, which directs histone modifier complex function and controls B cell differentiation-associated patterns of chromatin structure.© 2023.

"37647650","GraphCpG: Imputation of Single-cell Methylomes Based on Locus-aware Neighboring Subgraphs.","Bioinformatics","Single-cell DNA methylation sequencing can assay DNA methylation at single-cell resolution. However, incomplete coverage compromises related downstream analyses, outlining the importance of imputation techniques. With a rising number of cell samples in recent large datasets, scalable and efficient imputation models are critical to addressing the sparsity for genome-wide analyses.We proposed a novel graph-based deep learning approach to impute methylation matrices based on locus-aware neighboring subgraphs with locus-aware encoding orienting on one cell type. Merely using the CpGs methylation matrix, the obtained GraphCpG outperforms previous methods on datasets containing more than hundreds of cells and achieves competitive performance on smaller datasets, with subgraphs of predicted sites visualized by retrievable bipartite graphs. Besides better imputation performance with increasing cell num, it significantly reduces computation time and demonstrates improvement in downstream analysis.The source code is freely available at https://github.com/yuzhong-deng/graphcpg.git.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.© The Author(s) 2023.

Based on our previous RNA-sequencing data for oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)-inhibition resistant and OXPHOS-inhibition sensitive cancer cells, we found that vimentin (VIM) is highly expressed in the OXPHOS-inhibition resistant cancer cells, especially in glioma cancer cells. Further study of VIM in the literature indicates that it plays important roles in cancer progression, immunotherapy suppression, cancer stemness and drug resistance. However, its role in glioma remains elusive. This study aims to decipher the role of VIM in glioma, especially its role in OXPHOS-inhibition sensitivity, which may provide a promising therapeutic target for glioma treatment.The expression of VIM in glioma and the normal tissue has been obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, and further validated in Human Protein Atlas (HPA) and Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA). And the single-cell sequencing data was obtained from TISCH2. The immune infiltration was calculated via Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER), Estimation of Stromal and Immune Cells in Malignant Tumors using Expression Data (ESTIMATE) and ssGSEA, and the Immunophenoscore (IPS) was calculated via R package. The differentiated expressed genes were analyzed including GO/KEGG and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) between the VIM-high and -low groups. The methylation of VIM was checked at the EWAS and Methsurv. The correlation between VIM expression and cancer stemness was obtained from SangerBox. We also employed DepMap data and verified the role of VIM by knocking down it in VIM-high glioma cell and over-expressing it in VIM-low glioma cells to check the cell viability.Vim is highly expressed in the glioma patients compared to normal samples and its high expression negatively correlates with patients' survival. The DNA methylation in VIM promoters in glioma patients is lower than that in the normal samples. High VIM expression positively correlates with the immune infiltration and tumor progression. Furthermore, Vim is expressed high in the OXPHOS-inhibition glioma cancer cells and low in the OXPHOS-inhibition sensitive ones and its expression maintains the OXPHOS-inhibition resistance.In conclusion, we comprehensively deciphered the role of VIM in the progression of glioma and its clinical outcomes. Thus provide new insights into targeting VIM in glioma cancer immunotherapy in combination with the current treatment.© 2023. Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"37645844","IRF8 configures enhancer landscape in postnatal microglia and directs microglia specific transcriptional programs.","bioRxiv","Microglia are innate immune cells in the brain. Transcription factor IRF8 is highly expressed in microglia. However, its role in postnatal microglia development and the mechanism of action is unknown. We demonstrate here that IRF8 binds to enhancer regions of postnatal microglia in a stepwise fashion reaching a maximum after day 14, which coincided with the initiation of microglia function. Constitutive Irf8 deletion led to the loss of microglia identity gene expression and aberrant induction of Alzheimer's disease and neurodegeneration associated genes. Conditional Irf8 deletion in adult microglia showed similar transcriptome profiles, revealing the requirement of continuous IRF8 expression. Additional genome-wide analyses showed IRF8 is critical for setting microglia-specific chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation patterns. Lastly, in the 5xFAD mouse AD model, Irf8 deletion lessened the formation and spread of amyloidβ plaques, thereby reducing neuronal loss. Together, IRF8 sets the microglia epigenome landscape, required for eliciting microglia identity and function."

The goal of this study was to determine the impact by which liver-specific CPT1a deletion impacts hepatic lipid metabolism.Six-to-eight-week old male and female liver-specific knockout (LKO) and littermate controls were placed on a low-fat or high-fat diet (HFD; 60% kcal fat) for 15 weeks. Mice were necropsied after a 16 hour fast, and tissues were collected for lipidomics, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI), kinome analysis, RNA-sequencing, and protein expression by immunoblotting. Female LKO mice had increased serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels which were associated with greater deposition of hepatic lipids, while male mice were not affected by CPT1a deletion relative to male control mice. Mice with CPT1a deletion had reductions in DHA-containing phospholipids at the expense of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)-containing phospholipids in both whole liver and at the level of the lipid droplet (LD). Male and female LKO mice increased RNA levels of genes involved in LD lipolysis (Plin2,Cidec,G0S2) and in polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) metabolism (Elovl5, Fads1, Elovl2), while only female LKO mice increased genes involved in inflammation (Ly6d, Mmp12, Cxcl2). Kinase profiling showed decreased protein kinase A (PKA) activity, which coincided with increased PLIN2, PLIN5, and G0S2 protein levels and decreased triglyceride hydrolysis in LKO mice.Liver-specific deletion of CPT1a promotes sexually dimorphic steatotic liver disease (SLD) in mice, and here we have identified new mechanisms by which females are protected from HFD-induced liver injury."

However, knowledge of the impact of DNA methylation changes on pathogenesis of leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI1) antibody encephalitis remains limited.A total of 44 cytokines and 10 immune checkpoint moleculars (ICMs) in the serum of patients with LGI1 encephalitis and healthy donors (HDs) were measured to evaluate the association of them with clinical parameters. Genome-wide DNA methylation profiles were performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) from LGI1 encephalitis patients and HDs using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and validated for the methylation status by pyrosequencing. MicroRNA profiles were acquired in serum exosome by small RNA sequencing. Targeted cytokines expression was assessed at the presence or absence of miR-2467-5p in PBMCs and the culture media, and the binding of miR-2467-5p and its targeted genes was validated by luciferase assay.There existed significant difference in 22 cytokines/chemokines and 6 ICMs between LGI1 encephalitis patients and HDs. Decreased PDCD1 with increased ICAM1 could predict unfavorable prognosis in one-year follow-up for LGI1 encephalitis patients. Fifteen of cytokines/chemokines and ICMs presented DNA-methylated changes in the promoter and gene body using RRBS in which five were verified as methylation status by pyrosequencing, and the methylation level of CSF3, CCL2, and ICAM1 was conversely associated with their expression in PBMCs. By combining RRBS data with exosome-derived microRNA sequencing, we found that hypomethylated-driven hsa-miR-2467-5p presented elevated expression in serum exosomes and PBMCs in LGI1 encephalitis. Mechanically, miR-2467-5p significantly induced reduced expression of CSF3 and PDCD1 by binding with their 3`UTR while enhanced CCL15 expression, but not significantly correlated with peripheral blood CD19 + B cell proportion of LGI1 encephalitis patients.Our results provided convincing evidence for DNA methylation changes, microRNA profiles in serum exosome for LGI1 encephalitis, and we also identified several novel cytokines related to clinical features in which some represented epigenetic modification of methylated-driven pattern and microRNA modulation.

Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip data were available for 769 monozygotic twin pairs (mean age=36 years,range=18-78, 70% female), including pairs discordant or concordant for current or former smoking.Results:In pairs discordant for current smoking, 13 differentially methylated CpGs were found between current smoking twins and their genetically identical co-twin who never smoked. Top sites include multiple CpGs inCACNA1D and GNG12, which encode subunits of a calcium voltage-gated channel and G protein, respectively. These proteins interact with the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, suggesting that methylation levels at these CpGs might be reactive to nicotine exposure. All 13 CpGs have been previously associated with smoking in unrelated individuals and data from monozygotic pairs discordant for former smoking indicated that methylation patterns are to a large extent reversible upon smoking cessation. We further showed that differences in smoking level exposure for monozygotic twins who are both current smokers but differ in the number of cigarettes they smoke are reflected in their DNA methylation profiles.Conclusions:In conclusion, by analysing data from monozygotic twins, we robustly demonstrate that DNA methylation level in human blood cells is reactive to cigarette smoking.Funding:We acknowledge funding from the National Institute on Drug Abuse grant DA049867, the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO): Biobanking and Biomolecular Research Infrastructure (BBMRI-NL, NWO 184.033.111) and the BBRMI-NL-financed BIOS Consortium (NWO 184.021.007), NWO Large Scale infrastructures X-Omics (184.034.019), Genotype/phenotype database for behavior genetic and genetic epidemiological studies (ZonMw Middelgroot 911-09-032); Netherlands Twin Registry Repository: researching the interplay between genome and environment (NWO-Groot 480-15-001/674); the Avera Institute, Sioux Falls (USA) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH R01 HD042157-01A1, MH081802, Grand Opportunity grants 1RC2 MH089951 and 1RC2 MH089995); epigenetic data were generated at the Human Genomics Facility (HuGe-F) at ErasmusMC Rotterdam.

"37641110","Evaluation of the pooled sample method in Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip array by comparison with individual samples.","Clin Epigenetics","The pooled sample method is used in epigenomic research and expression analysis and is a cost-effective screening approach for small amounts of DNA. Evaluation of the pooled sample method in epigenomic studies is performed using the Illumina Infinium Methylation 450K BeadChip array; however, subsequent reports on the updated 850K array are lacking. A previous study demonstrated that the methylation levels obtained from individual samples were accurately replicated using pooled samples but did not address epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) statistics. The DNA quantification method, which is important for the homogeneous mixing of DNA in the pooled sample method, has since become fluorescence-based, and additional factors need to be considered including the resolution of batch effects of microarray chips and the heterogeneity of the cellular proportions from which the DNA samples are derived. In this study, four pooled samples were created from 44 individual samples, and EWAS statistics for differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and regions (DMRs) were conducted for individual samples and compared with the statistics obtained from the pooled samples.The methylation levels could be reproduced fairly well in the pooled samples. This was the case for the entire dataset and when limited to the top 100 CpG sites, consistent with a previous study using the 450K BeadChip array. However, the statistical results of the EWAS for the DMP by individual samples were not replicated in pooled samples. Qualitative analyses highlighting methylation within an arbitrary candidate gene were replicable. Focusing on chr 20, the statistical results of EWAS for DMR from individual samples showed replicability in the pooled samples as long as they were limited to regions with a sufficient effect size.The pooled sample method replicated the methylation values well and can be used for EWAS in DMR. This method is sample amount-effective and cost-effective and can be utilized for screening by carefully understanding the effective features and disadvantages of the pooled sample method and combining it with candidate gene analyses.© 2023.

"37640118","Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis reveals layer-specific methylation patterns in deer antler tissue.","Gene","This paper explored using of deer antlers as a model for studying rapid growth and cartilage formation in mammals. The genes and regulatory mechanisms involved in antler chondrogenesis are poorly understood, however, previous research has suggested that DNA methylation played a key role in antler regeneration. By using fluorescence-labeled methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (F-MSAP), this study measured DNA methylation levels in cartilage (CA) and reserve mesenchyme (RM) cells and tissues. Results showed that RM cells (RMCs) DNA methylation levels were significantly lower than those of CA, suggesting that DNA demethylation may be involved in antler fast cartilage differentiation. The study also identified 20 methylated fragments specific to RMCs or CA using the methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP) technique and confirmed these findings using southern blot analysis. The data provide the first experimental evidence of a link between epigenetic regulation and rapid cartilage differentiation in antlers.Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier B.V."
"37635873","Co-occurrence of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1B: coincidence or common molecular mechanism?","Front Cell Dev Biol","Imprinting disorders are congenital diseases caused by dysregulation of genomic imprinting, affecting growth, neurocognitive development, metabolism and cancer predisposition. Overlapping clinical features are often observed among this group of diseases. In rare cases, two fully expressed imprinting disorders may coexist in the same patient. A dozen cases of this type have been reported so far. Most of them are represented by individuals affected by Beckwith-Wiedemann spectrum (BWSp) and Transient Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus (TNDM) or BWSp and Pseudo-hypoparathyroidism type 1B (PHP1B). All these patients displayed Multilocus imprinting disturbances (MLID). Here, we report the first case of co-occurrence of BWS and PHP1B in the same individual in absence of MLID. Genome-wide methylation and SNP-array analyses demonstrated loss of methylation of theKCNQ1OT1:TSS-DMR on chromosome 11p15.5 as molecular cause of BWSp, and upd(20)pat as cause of PHP1B. The absence of MLID and the heterodisomy of chromosome 20 suggests that BWSp and PHP1B arose through distinct and independent mechanism in our patient. However, we cannot exclude that the rare combination of the epigenetic defect on chromosome 11 and the UPD on chromosome 20 may originate from a common so far undetermined predisposing molecular lesion. A better comprehension of the molecular mechanisms underlying the co-occurrence of two imprinting disorders will improve genetic counselling and estimate of familial recurrence risk of these rare cases. Furthermore, our study also supports the importance of multilocus molecular testing for revealing MLID as well as complex cases of imprinting disorders.Copyright © 2023 Pignata, Cecere, Acquaviva, D’Angelo, Cioffi, Pellino, Palumbo, Palumbo, Carella, Sparago, De Brasi, Cerrato and Riccio."
"37634866","KDM2B-Rearranged Soft-Tissue Sarcomas Expand the Concept of BCOR-Associated Sarcoma.","Mod Pathol","Sarcomas with BCOR genetic alterations (BCOR-associated sarcomas) represent a recently recognized family of soft tissue and bone tumors characterized by BCOR fusion, BCOR internal tandem duplication, or YWHAE::NUTM2B fusion. Histologically, the tumors demonstrate oval-spindle cell proliferation in a variably vascular stroma and overexpression of BCOR and SATB2. Herein, we describe three soft tissue sarcomas with KDM2B fusions that phenotypically and epigenetically match BCOR-associated sarcomas. The cases included one infant, one adolescent, and one older patient. All tumors showed histological findings indistinguishable from those of BCOR-associated sarcomas and were originally diagnosed as such based on the phenotype. However, none of the tumors had BCOR or YWHAE genetic alterations. Instead, targeted RNA sequencing identified in-frame KDM2B::NUTM2B, KDM2B::CREBBP, and KDM2B::DUX4 fusions. KDM2B fusions were validated using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, Sanger sequencing, and in situ hybridization assays. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis matched all three tumors with BCOR-associated sarcomas using the DKFZ classifier and t-SNE analysis. One localized tumor showed a flat genome-wide copy number profile, and the patient remained disease-free after treatment. The other tumors showed multiple copy number alterations, including MDM2/CDK4 amplification and/or CDKN2A/B loss, and both tumors metastasized, leading to the patient's death in one of the cases. When tested using KDM2B immunohistochemistry, all three KDM2B-rearranged sarcomas showed diffuse strong staining, and all 13 sarcomas with BCOR genetic alterations also demonstrated diffuse, strong or weak staining. By contrast, among 72 mimicking tumors, only a subset of synovial sarcomas showed focal or diffuse weak KDM2B expression. In conclusion, our study suggests that KDM2B-rearranged soft tissue sarcomas belong to the BCOR-associated sarcoma family and expand its molecular spectrum. This may be related to the known molecular relationship between KDM2B and BCOR in the polycomb repressive complex 1.1. Immunohistochemical analysis of KDM2B is a potentially valuable diagnostic tool for BCOR-associated sarcomas, including those with KDM2B rearrangement.Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier Inc."
"37634000","Objective and subjective measures of sleep initiation are differentially associated with DNA methylation in adolescents.","Clin Epigenetics","The onset of puberty is associated with a shift in the circadian timing of sleep, leading to delayed sleep initiation [i.e., later sleep onset time (SOT)] due to later bedtimes and/or longer sleep onset latency (SOL). Several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified genes that may be involved in the etiology of sleep phenotypes. However, circadian rhythms are also epigenetically regulated; therefore, epigenetic biomarkers may provide insight into the physiology of the pubertal sleep onset shift and the pathophysiology of prolonged or delayed sleep initiation.The gene-wide analysis indicated differential methylation within or around 1818 unique genes across the sleep initiation measurements using self-report, actigraphy (ACT), and polysomnography (PSG), while GWAS-informed analysis yielded 67 genes. Gene hits were identified for bedtime (PSG), SOL (subjective, ACT and PSG) and SOT (subjective and PSG). DNA methylation within 12 genes was associated with both subjective and PSG-measured SOL, 31 with both ACT- and PSG-measured SOL, 19 with both subjective and ACT-measured SOL, and one gene (SMG1P2) had methylation sites associated with subjective, ACT- and PSG-measured SOL.Objective and subjective sleep initiation in adolescents is associated with altered DNA methylation in genes previously identified in adult GWAS of sleep and circadian phenotypes. Additionally, our data provide evidence for a potential epigenetic link between habitual (subjective and ACT) SOL and in-lab SOT and DNA methylation in and around genes involved in circadian regulation (i.e., RASD1, RAI1), cardiometabolic disorders (i.e., FADS1, WNK1, SLC5A6), and neuropsychiatric disorders (i.e., PRR7, SDK1, FAM172A). If validated, these sites may provide valuable targets for early detection and prevention of disorders involving prolonged or delayed SOT, such as insomnia, delayed sleep phase, and their comorbidity.© 2023.

This review chapter offers an overview of genomic and omics studies revealing the genetic contribution to aggression and first insights into associations with epigenetic and other omics (e.g., metabolomics) profiles. We allowed for a broad phenotype definition including studies on ""aggression,"" ""aggressive behavior,"" or ""aggression-related traits,"" ""antisocial behavior,"" ""conduct disorder,"" and ""oppositional defiant disorder."" Heritability estimates based on family and twin studies in children and adults of this broadly defined phenotype of aggression are around 50%, with relatively small fluctuations around this estimate. Next, we review the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) which search for associations with alleles and also allow for gene-based tests and epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) which seek to identify associations with differently methylated regions across the genome. Both GWAS and EWAS allow for construction of Polygenic and DNA methylation scores at an individual level. Currently, these predict a small percentage of variance in aggression. We expect that increases in sample size will lead to additional discoveries in GWAS and EWAS, and that multiomics approaches will lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the molecular underpinnings of aggression.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

"37630855","Toward Precision Weight-Loss Dietary Interventions: Findings from the POUNDS Lost Trial.","Nutrients","The POUNDS Lost trial is a 2-year clinical trial testing the effects of dietary interventions on weight loss. This study included 811 adults with overweight or obesity who were randomized to one of four diets that contained either 15% or 25% protein and 20% or 40% fat in a 2 × 2 factorial design. By 2 years, participants on average lost from 2.9 to 3.6 kg in body weight in the four intervention arms, while no significant difference was observed across the intervention arms. In POUNDS Lost, we performed a series of ancillary studies to detect intrinsic factors particular to genomic, epigenomic, and metabolomic markers that may modulate changes in weight and other cardiometabolic traits in response to the weight-loss dietary interventions. Genomic variants identified from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) on obesity, type 2 diabetes, glucose and lipid metabolisms, gut microbiome, and dietary intakes have been found to interact with dietary macronutrients (fat, protein, and carbohydrates) in relation to weight loss and changes of body composition and cardiometabolic traits. In addition, we recently investigated epigenomic modifications, particularly blood DNA methylation and circulating microRNAs (miRNAs). We reported DNA methylation levels atNFATC2IP,CPT1A,TXNIP, andLINC00319were related to weight loss or changes of glucose, lipids, and blood pressure; we also reported thrifty miRNA expression as a significant epigenomic marker related to changes in insulin sensitivity and adiposity. Our studies have also highlighted the importance of temporal changes in novel metabolomic signatures for gut microbiota, bile acids, and amino acids as predictors for achievement of successful weight loss outcomes. Moreover, our studies indicate that biochemical, behavioral, and psychosocial factors such as physical activity, sleep disturbance, and appetite may also modulate metabolic changes during dietary interventions. This review summarized our major findings in the POUNDS Lost trial, which provided preliminary evidence supporting the development of precision diet interventions for obesity management."

However, little information is available regarding the evolutionary relationships and characteristics of the RWP-RK family genes in cassava, an important tropical crop. Herein, 13 RWP-RK proteins identified in cassava were unevenly distributed across 9 of the 18 chromosomes (Chr), and these proteins were divided into two clusters based on their phylogenetic distance. The NLP subfamily contained seven cassava proteins including GAF, RWP-RK, and PB1 domains; the RKD subfamily contained six cassava proteins including the RWP-RK domain. Genes of the NLP subfamily had a longer sequence and more introns than the RKD subfamily. A large number of hormone- and stress-related cis-acting elements were found in the analysis of RWP-RK promoters. Real-time quantitative PCR revealed that all MeNLP1-7 and MeRKD1/3/5 genes responded to different abiotic stressors (water deficit, cold temperature, mannitol, polyethylene glycol, NaCl, and H2O2), hormonal treatments (abscisic acid and methyl jasmonate), and nitrogen starvation. MeNLP3/4/5/6/7 and MeRKD3/5, which can quickly and efficiently respond to different stresses, were found to be important candidate genes for further functional assays in cassava. The MeRKD5 and MeNLP6 proteins were localized to the cell nucleus in tobacco leaf. Five and one candidate proteins interacting with MeRKD5 and MeNLP6, respectively, were screened from the cassava nitrogen starvation library, including agamous-like mads-box protein AGL14, metallothionein 2, Zine finger FYVE domain containing protein, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, E3 Ubiquitin-protein ligase HUWE1, and PPR repeat family protein. These results provided a solid basis to understand abiotic stress responses and signal transduction mediated by RWP-RK genes in cassava."

To identify samples exhibiting hypermethylation, we used unsupervised hierarchical clustering on genome-wide methylation data. This clustering analysis revealed the presence of four distinct subtypes within the tumor samples, namely, CIMP-H, CIMP-L, cluster 3, and cluster 4. These subtypes demonstrated varying levels of methylation, categorized as high, intermediate, and very low. To gain further insights, we mapped significant probes from all clusters to Ensembl Regulatory build 89, with a specific focus on those located within promoter regions or bound regions. By intersecting the methylated promoter and bound regions across all methylation subtypes, we identified a total of 253 genes exhibiting aberrant methylation patterns in the promoter regions across all four subtypes of colorectal cancer. Among these genes, our comprehensive genome-wide analysis highlights bone morphogenic protein 4 (BMP4) as the most prominent candidate. This significant finding was derived through the utilization of various bioinformatics tools, emphasizing the potential role ofBMP4in colorectal cancer development and progression."

Among those epigenetic mechanisms, DNA methylation (DNAm) is influenced by genotype and the environment, making it an important molecular interface for studying disease etiology and progression. In this study, we examined the whole blood DNA methylation profiles of a large group of people with (pw) multiple sclerosis (MS) compared to those of controls. We reveal that methylation differences in pwMS occur independently of known genetic risk loci and show that they more strongly differentiate disease (AUC = 0.85, 95% CI 0.82-0.89,p= 1.22 × 10-29) than known genetic risk loci (AUC = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.66-0.76,p= 9.07 × 10-17). We also show that methylation differences in MS occur predominantly in B cells and monocytes and indicate the involvement of cell-specific biological pathways. Overall, this study comprehensively characterizes the immune cell-specific epigenetic architecture of MS."

The study, based on three publicly available EWAS (Epigenetic Wide Association Study) datasets, focuses on the comparison between these two groups of breast cancer using an epimutation score. The score is calculated not only based on the presence of the epimutation, but also on the deviation amplitude of the methylation outlier value. For each dataset, we performed a functional analysis based first on the functional gene region of each annotated gene (we aggregated the data per gene region TSS1500, TSS200, first-exon, and body-gene identified by the information from the Illumina Data Sheet), and then, we performed a pathway enrichment analysis through the REACTOME database based on the genes with the highest epimutation score. Thus, we blended our results and found common pathways for all three datasets. We found that a higher and significant epimutation score due to hypermethylation in ER-positive BC is present in the promoter region of the genes belonging to the SUMOylation pathway, the Notch pathway, the IFN-γ signalling pathway, and the deubiquitination protease pathway, while a higher and significant level of epimutation due to hypomethylation in ER-positive BC is present in the promoter region of the genes belonging to the ESR-mediated pathway. The presence of this state of promoter hypomethylation in the ESR-mediated signalling genes is consistent and coherent with an active signalling pathway mediated by oestrogen function in the group of ER-positive BC. The SUMOylation and Notch pathways are associated with BC pathogenesis and have been found to play distinct roles in the two BC subgroups. We speculated that the altered methylation profile may play a role in regulating signalling pathways with specific functions in the two subgroups of ER BC."
"37620312","Methylation across the central dogma in health and diseases: new therapeutic strategies.","Signal Transduct Target Ther","The proper transfer of genetic information from DNA to RNA to protein is essential for cell-fate control, development, and health. Methylation of DNA, RNAs, histones, and non-histone proteins is a reversible post-synthesis modification that finetunes gene expression and function in diverse physiological processes. Aberrant methylation caused by genetic mutations or environmental stimuli promotes various diseases and accelerates aging, necessitating the development of therapies to correct the disease-driver methylation imbalance. In this Review, we summarize the operating system of methylation across the central dogma, which includes writers, erasers, readers, and reader-independent outputs. We then discuss how dysregulation of the system contributes to neurological disorders, cancer, and aging. Current small-molecule compounds that target the modifiers show modest success in certain cancers. The methylome-wide action and lack of specificity lead to undesirable biological effects and cytotoxicity, limiting their therapeutic application, especially for diseases with a monogenic cause or different directions of methylation changes. Emerging tools capable of site-specific methylation manipulation hold great promise to solve this dilemma.

"37615725","SMYD2 regulates vascular smooth muscle cell phenotypic switching and intimal hyperplasia via interaction with myocardin.","Cell Mol Life Sci","The SET and MYND domain-containing protein 2 (SMYD2) is a histone lysine methyltransferase that has been reported to regulate carcinogenesis and inflammation. However, its role in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) homeostasis and vascular diseases has not been determined. Here, we investigated the role of SMYD2 in VSMC phenotypic modulation and vascular intimal hyperplasia and elucidated the underlying mechanism. We observed that SMYD2 expression was downregulated in injured carotid arteries in mice and phenotypically modulated VSMCs in vitro. Using an SMC-specific SMYD2 knockout mouse model, we found that SMYD2 ablation in VSMCs exacerbated neointima formation after vascular injury in vivo. Conversely, SMYD2 overexpression inhibited VSMC proliferation and migration in vitro and attenuated arterial narrowing in injured vessels in mice. SMYD2 downregulation promoted VSMC phenotypic switching accompanied with enhanced proliferation and migration. Mechanistically, genome-wide transcriptome analysis and loss/gain-of-function studies revealed that SMYD2 up-regulated VSMC contractile gene expression and suppressed VSMC proliferation and migration, in part, by promoting expression and transactivation of the master transcription cofactor myocardin. In addition, myocardin directly interacted with SMYD2, thereby facilitating SMYD2 recruitment to the CArG regions of SMC contractile gene promoters and leading to an open chromatin status around SMC contractile gene promoters via SMYD2-mediated H3K4 methylation. Hence, we conclude that SMYD2 is a novel regulator of VSMC contractile phenotype and intimal hyperplasia via a myocardin-dependent epigenetic regulatory mechanism.© 2023.

"37614712",NA,NA,"Over the past 50 years, the number of overweight/obese people increased significantly, making obesity a global public health challenge. Apart from rare monogenic forms, obesity is a multifactorial disease, most likely resulting from a concerted interaction of genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors. Although recent studies opened new avenues in elucidating the complex genetics behind obesity, the biological mechanisms contributing to individual's risk to become obese are not yet fully understood. Non-genetic factors such as eating behaviour or physical activity are strong contributing factors for the onset of obesity. These factors may interact with genetic predispositions most likelyviaepigenetic mechanisms. Epigenome-wide association studies or methylome-wide association studies are measuring DNA methylation at single CpGs across thousands of genes and capture associations to obesity phenotypes such as BMI. However, they only represent a snapshot in the complex biological network and cannot distinguish between causes and consequences. Intervention studies are therefore a suitable method to control for confounding factors and to avoid possible sources of bias. In particular, intervention studies documenting changes in obesity-associated epigenetic markers during lifestyle driven weight loss, make an important contribution to a better understanding of epigenetic reprogramming in obesity. To investigate the impact of lifestyle in obesity state specific DNA methylation, especially concerning the development of new strategies for prevention and individual therapy, we reviewed 19 most recent human intervention studies. In summary, this review highlights the huge potential of targeted interventions to alter disease-associated epigenetic patterns. However, there is an urgent need for further robust and larger studies to identify the specific DNA methylation biomarkers which influence obesity.Copyright © 2023 Aurich, Müller, Kovacs and Keller."
"37614211","Epigenomic divergence correlates with sequence polymorphism in Arabidopsis paralogs.","New Phytol","Processes affecting rates of sequence polymorphism are fundamental to the evolution of gene duplicates. The relationship between gene activity and sequence polymorphism can influence the likelihood that functionally redundant gene copies are co-maintained in stable evolutionary equilibria vs other outcomes such as neofunctionalization. Here, we investigate genic variation in epigenome-associated polymorphism rates in Arabidopsis thaliana and consider whether these affect the evolution of gene duplicates. We compared the frequency of sequence polymorphism and patterns of genetic differentiation between genes classified by exon methylation patterns: unmethylated (unM), gene-body methylated (gbM), and transposon-like methylated (teM) states, which reflect divergence in gene expression. We found that the frequency of polymorphism was higher in teM (transcriptionally repressed, tissue-specific) genes and lower in gbM (active, constitutively expressed) genes. Comparisons of gene duplicates were largely consistent with genome-wide patterns - gene copies that exhibit teM accumulate more variation, evolve faster, and are in chromatin states associated with reduced DNA repair. This relationship between expression, the epigenome, and polymorphism may lead to the breakdown of equilibrium states that would otherwise maintain genetic redundancies. Epigenome-mediated polymorphism rate variation may facilitate the evolution of novel gene functions in duplicate paralogs maintained over evolutionary time.© 2023 The Authors.

Investigating epigenetic alterations induced by maternal obesity during fetal development could gain mechanistic insight into the developmental origins of childhood obesity. While obesity disproportionately affects underrepresented racial and ethnic mothers and children in the USA, few studies investigated the role of prenatal epigenetic programming in intergenerational obesity of these high-risk populations.This study included 903 mother-child pairs from the Boston Birth Cohort, a predominantly urban, low-income minority birth cohort. Mother-infant dyads were enrolled at birth and the children were followed prospectively to age 18 years. Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip was used to measure epigenome-wide methylation level of cord blood. We performed an epigenome-wide association study of maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and cord blood DNA methylation (DNAm). To quantify the degree to which cord blood DNAm mediates the maternal BMI-childhood obesity, we further investigated whether maternal BMI-associated DNAm sites impact birthweight or childhood overweight or obesity (OWO) from age 1 to age 18 and performed corresponding mediation analyses.The study sample contained 52.8% maternal pre-pregnancy OWO and 63.2% offspring OWO at age 1-18 years. Maternal BMI was associated with cord blood DNAm at 8 CpG sites (genome-wide false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05). After accounting for the possible interplay of maternal BMI and smoking, 481 CpG sites were discovered for association with maternal BMI. Among them 123 CpGs were associated with childhood OWO, ranging from 42% decrease to 87% increase in OWO risk for each SD increase in DNAm. A total of 14 identified CpG sites showed a significant mediation effect on the maternal BMI-child OWO association (FDR < 0.05), with mediating proportion ranging from 3.99% to 25.21%. Several of these 14 CpGs were mapped to genes in association with energy balance and metabolism (AKAP7) and adulthood metabolic syndrome (CAMK2B).This prospective birth cohort study in a high-risk yet understudied US population found that maternal pre-pregnancy OWO significantly altered DNAm in newborn cord blood and provided suggestive evidence of epigenetic involvement in the intergenerational risk of obesity.© 2023.

"37612365","Epigenetic analysis suggests aberrant cerebellum brain aging in old-aged adults with autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia.","Mol Psychiatry","The aberrant aging hypothesis of schizophrenia (SCZ) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been proposed, and the DNA methylation (DNAm) clock, which is a cumulative evaluation of DNAm levels at age-related CpGs, could serve as a biological aging indicator. This study evaluated epigenetic brain aging of ASD and SCZ using Horvath's epigenetic clock, based on two public genome-wide DNA methylation datasets of post-mortem brain samples (NASD = 222; NSCZ = 142). Total subjects were further divided into subgroups by gender and age. The epigenetic age acceleration (AgeAccel) for each sample was calculated as the residual value resulting from the regression model and compared between groups. Results showed DNAm age has a strong correlation with chronological age in both datasets across multiple brain regions (P < 0.05). When divided into equally sized age groups, the AgeAccel of the cerebellum (CB) region from people over 45 years of age was greater compared to the control sample (AgeAccel of ASD vs control: 5.069 vs -6.249; P < 0.001). And a decelerated epigenetic aging process was observed in the CB region of individuals with SCZ aged 50-70 years (AgeAccel of SCZ vs control: -3.171 vs 2.418; P < 0.05). However, our results showed no significant difference in AgeAccel between ASD and control groups, and between SCZ and control groups in the total and gender-specific groups (P > 0.05). This study's results revealed some evidence for aberrant epigenetic CB brain aging in old-aged patients with ASD and SCZ, indicating a different pattern of CB aging in older adults with these two diseases. However, further studies of larger ASD and SCZ cohorts are necessary to make definitive conclusions on this observation.© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited."

Genetic and environmental interactions may contribute to these high-risk trajectories through epigenetic variation Objectives: A pilot to broadly characterise genetic and epigenetic contributions to high-risk trajectories in middle-aged people.Blood genome-wide genetic and epigenetic markers were profiled in 160 donors at 45 years of age from the Tasmanian Longitudinal Health Study (TAHS). High-risk subjects were selected from three previously published lifetime FEV1 trajectories that together accounted for 75% of COPD prevalence at age 53 years, and were matched to persistently high trajectory controls. Differentially methylated regions and epigenetic age acceleration differences between the groups were examined. The impact of co-morbidities and genetic variants on the observed epigenetic associations were investigated.Subjects from the high risk FEV1 trajectories exhibited 55 novel regions of epigenetic divergence (FDR < 0.05) at genes related to cellular adhesion and epithelial biology. Current asthma or COPD co-morbidities partially explained these changes. Allelic variation at Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) and other loci was associated with epigenetic changes and linked to lung specific gene expression signatures and COPD/lung function traits in GWAS. Epigenetic age acceleration was independently associated with high-risk trajectories, which was most pronounced in the rapid decline one.High risk trajectories that progress to COPD exhibited genetic and epigenetic associations at epithelial and histocompatibility genes as well as accelerated epigenetic ageing."

We performed an epigenome-wide association analysis of blood-based methylation levels at CpG sites with incident type 2 diabetes using Cox regression in 2,091 Black and 1,029 White individuals from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study. At an epigenome-wide significance threshold of 10-7, we detected 7 novel diabetes-associated CpG sites inC1orf151(cg05380846: HR= 0.89,p= 8.4 × 10-12),ZNF2(cg01585592: HR= 0.88,p= 1.6 × 10-9),JPH3(cg16696007: HR= 0.87,p= 7.8 × 10-9),GPX6(cg02793507: HR= 0.85,p= 2.7 × 10-8and cg00647063: HR= 1.20,p= 2.5 × 10-8), chr17q25 (cg16865890: HR= 0.8,p= 6.9 × 10-8), and chr11p15 (cg13738793: HR= 1.11,p= 7.7 × 10-8). The CpG sites atC1orf151,ZNF2, JPH3andGPX6, were identified in Black adults, chr17q25 was identified in White adults, and chr11p15 was identified upon meta-analyzing the two groups. The CpG sites atJPH3andGPX6were likely associated with incident type 2 diabetes independent of BMI. All the CpG sites, except atJPH3, were likely consequences of elevated glucose at baseline. We additionally replicated known type 2 diabetes-associated CpG sites including cg19693031 atTXNIP, cg00574958 atCPT1A, cg16567056 atPLBC2, cg11024682 atSREBF1, cg08857797 atVPS25, and cg06500161 atABCG1, 3 of which were replicated in Black adults at the epigenome-wide threshold. We observed modest increase in type 2 diabetes variance explained upon addition of the significantly associated CpG sites to a Cox model that included traditional type 2 diabetes risk factors and fasting glucose (increase from 26.2% to 30.5% in Black adults; increase from 36.9% to 39.4% in White adults). We examined if groups of proximal CpG sites were associated with incident type 2 diabetes using a gene-region specific and a gene-region agnostic differentially methylated region (DMR) analysis. Our DMR analyses revealed several clusters of significant CpG sites, including a DMR consisting of a previously discovered CpG site atADCY7and promoter regions ofTP63which were differentially methylated across all race groups. This study illustrates improved discovery of CpG sites/regions by leveraging both individual CpG site and DMR analyses in an unexplored population. Our findings include genes linked to diabetes in experimental studies (e.g.,GPX6,JPH3,andTP63), and future gene-specific methylation studies could elucidate the link between genes, environment, and methylation in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes."

CpG methylation levels in the placenta and blood also differ by sex and are associated with adverse health outcomes. We contrasted CpG methylation levels in the placenta and neonatal blood (n = 358) from the Extremely Low Gestational Age Newborn (ELGAN) cohort based on the EPIC array, which assays over 850,000 CpG sites across the epigenome. Sex-specific epigenome-wide association analyses were conducted for the placenta and neonatal blood samples independently, and the results were compared to determine tissue-specific differences between the methylation patterns in males and females. All models were adjusted for cell type heterogeneity. Enrichment pathway analysis was performed to identify the biological functions of genes related to the sexually dimorphic CpG sites.Approximately 11,500 CpG sites were differentially methylated in relation to sex. Of these, 5949 were placenta-specific and 5361 were blood-specific, with only 233 CpG sites overlapping in both tissues. For placenta-specific CpG sites, 90% were hypermethylated in males. For blood-specific CpG sites, 95% were hypermethylated in females. In the placenta, keratinocyte differentiation biological pathways were enriched among the differentially methylated genes. No enrichment pathways were observed for blood.Distinct methylation patterns were observed between male and female children born extremely premature, and keratinocyte differentiation pathways were enriched in the placenta. These findings provide new insights into the epigenetic mechanisms underlying sexually dimorphic health outcomes among extremely premature infants.© 2023.

We herein validate the methylated state of these genes in independent study populations, based on histology ascertained outcomes regardless of human papillomavirus status. CA10, DPP10, FMN2 and HAS1 (discovery set: 54 normal, 50 CIN1, 40 CIN2, 42 CIN3) were evaluated by targeted bisulfite next generation sequencing (NGS) (Illumina MiSeq platform) in 258 (training set: 100 normal, 50 CIN1, 50 CIN2, 50 CIN3, 8 cancers) and 373 (validation set: 100 normal, 57 CIN1, 61 CIN2, 53 CIN3, 102 cancers) physician-collected samples (PreservCyt). Using targeted amplification NGS data from the training set for 94 normal and eight cancer samples, we calculated for each gene the median methylation value. These were summed and normalized to compute a four-gene Marker Polygenic Score (MPS). We compared the relationship between MPS and progression from normal through CIN grades and cancer, separately in the training and validation sets, and tested its clinical performance via receiver-operating characteristic curves. MPS increased with increasing CIN grade, and accurately predicted cervical cancer in the training (area under the curve, AUC = 0.9950) and validation (AUC = 0.9337) sets, comparing normal to cancer. Using the highest threshold of 100% specificity, sensitivity for detection of cervical cancer was 67.7%; whereas reducing specificity to 95% increased sensitivity to 84.3%.

"37605101","DNA methylation age acceleration contributes to the development and prediction of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.","Geroscience","Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is prevalent in the aging society. Despite body weight reduction, the prevalence of NAFLD has been increasing with aging for unknown reasons. Here, we investigate the association of DNA methylation age acceleration, a hallmark of aging, with risk of NAFLD. Genome-wide DNA methylation profiles were measured in 95 participants who developed type 2 diabetes during 4-year follow-up, and 356 randomly sampled participants from Shanghai Changfeng Study. DNA methylation age was calculated using the Horvath's method, and liver fat content (LFC) was measured using a quantitative ultrasound method. Subjects with highest tertile of DNA methylation age acceleration (≥ 9.5 years) had significantly higher LFC (7.2% vs 3.1%, P = 0.008) but lower body fat percentage (29.7% vs 33.0%, P = 0.032) than those with lowest tertile of DNA methylation age acceleration (< 4.0 years). After adjustment for age, sex, alcohol drinking, cigarette smoking, BMI, waist circumference, and different type blood cell counts, the risk of NAFLD was still significantly increased in the highest tertile group (OR, 4.55; 95% CI, 1.06-19.61). Even in subjects with similar LFC at baseline, DNA methylation age acceleration was associated with higher increase in LFC (4.0 ± 10.7% vs 0.9 ± 9.5%, P = 0.004) after a median of 4-year follow-up. Further analysis found that 6 CpGs of Horvath age predictors were associated with longitudinal changes in LFC after multivariate adjustment and located on genes that might lead to fat redistribution from peripheral adipose to liver. Combination of the key CpG methylation related to liver fat content with conventional risk factors improves the performance for NAFLD prediction.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37603212","Identification of gene-level methylation for disease prediction.","Interdiscip Sci","DNA methylation is an epigenetic alteration that plays a fundamental part in governing gene regulatory processes. The DNA methylation mechanism affixes methyl groups to distinct cytosine residues, influencing chromatin architectures. Multiple studies have demonstrated that DNA methylation's regulatory effect on genes is linked to the beginning and progression of several disorders. Researchers have recently uncovered thousands of phenotype-related methylation sites through the epigenome-wide association study (EWAS). However, combining the methylation levels of several sites within a gene and determining the gene-level DNA methylation remains challenging. In this study, we proposed the supervised UMAP Assisted Gene-level Methylation method (sUAGM) for disease prediction based on supervised UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection), a manifold learning-based method for reducing dimensionality. The methylation values at the gene level generated using the proposed method are evaluated by employing various feature selection and classification algorithms on three distinct DNA methylation datasets derived from blood samples. The performance has been assessed employing classification accuracy, F-1 score, Mathews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), Kappa, Classification Success Index (CSI) and Jaccard Index. The Support Vector Machine with the linear kernel (SVML) classifier with Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) performs best across all three datasets. From comparative analysis, our method outperformed existing gene-level and site-level approaches by achieving 100% accuracy and F1-score with fewer genes.

"37602818","DNA methylation-based testing in peripheral blood mononuclear cells enables accurate and early detection of colorectal cancer.","Cancer Res","An effective blood-based method for the diagnosis of colorectal cancer (CRC) has not yet been developed. Molecular alterations of immune cells occur early in tumorigenesis, providing the theoretical underpinning for early cancer diagnosis based on immune cell profiling. Therefore, we aimed to develop an effective detection method based on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to improve the diagnosis of CRC. Analysis of the genome-wide methylation landscape of PBMCs from CRC patients and healthy controls by microarray, pyrosequencing, and targeted bisulfite sequencing revealed five DNA methylation markers for CRC diagnosis, especially early-stage CRC (eCRC). A single-tube multiple methylation-specific quantitative PCR assay (multi-msqPCR) for simultaneous detection of five methylation markers was established, which allowed quantitative analysis of samples with as little as 0.1% PBMC DNA and had better discriminative performance than single-molecule detection. Then, a CRC diagnostic model (CDM) based on methylation markers and the multi-msqPCR method was constructed that achieved high accuracy for eCRC (AUC=0.91; sensitivity=81.18%; specificity=89.39%), which was improved compared to CEA (AUC=0.79). The CDM also enabled a high degree of discrimination for advanced adenoma (AA) cases (AUC=0.85, sensitivity=63.04%). Follow-up data also demonstrated that the CDM could identify CRC potential up to 2 years before currently used diagnostic methods. In conclusion, the approach constructed in this study based on PBMC-derived DNA methylation markers and a multi-msqPCR method is a promising and easily implementable diagnostic method for eCRC."

In this study, we developed a methylation signature that precisely predicts overall survival (OS) after surgery.An epigenome-wide study of DNA methylation based on whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) was conducted for two independent cohorts (discovery cohort, n=164; validation cohort, n=170) from three hepatobiliary centers in China. By referring to differentially methylated regions (DMRs), we proposed the concept of prognostically methylated regions (PMRs), which were composed of consecutive prognostically methylated CpGs (PMCs). Using machine learning strategies (Random Forest and the least absolute shrinkage and selector regression), a prognostic methylation score (PMS) was constructed based on 14 PMRs in the discovery cohort and confirmed in the validation cohort.The C-indices of the PMS for predicting OS in the discovery and validation cohorts were 0.79 and 0.74, respectively. In the whole cohort, the PMS was an independent predictor of OS [hazard ratio (HR) =8.12; 95% confidence interval (CI): 5.48-12.04; P<0.001], and the C-index (0.78) of the PMS was significantly higher than that of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (JHUSM) nomogram (0.69, P<0.001), the Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital (EHBSH) nomogram (0.67, P<0.001), American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging system (0.61, P<0.001), and MEGNA prognostic score (0.60, P<0.001). The patients in quartile 4 of PMS could benefit from adjuvant therapy (AT) (HR =0.54; 95% CI: 0.32-0.91; log-rank P=0.043), whereas those in the quartiles 1-3 could not. However, other nomograms and staging system failed to do so. Further analyses of potential mechanisms showed that the PMS was associated with tumor biological behaviors, pathway activation, and immune microenvironment.The PMS could improve the prognostic accuracy and identify patients who would benefit from AT for ICC patients, and might facilitate decisions in treatment of ICC patients.2023 Hepatobiliary Surgery and Nutrition.

"37600946","Prediction accuracy of regulatory elements from sequence varies by functional sequencing technique.","Front Cell Infect Microbiol","Various sequencing based approaches are used to identify and characterize the activities ofcis-regulatory elements in a genome-wide fashion. Some of these techniques rely on indirect markers such as histone modifications (ChIP-seq with histone antibodies) or chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq, DNase-seq, FAIRE-seq), while other techniques use direct measures such as episomal assays measuring the enhancer properties of DNA sequences (STARR-seq) and direct measurement of the binding of transcription factors (ChIP-seq with transcription factor-specific antibodies). The activities ofcis-regulatory elements such as enhancers, promoters, and repressors are determined by their sequence and secondary processes such as chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation, and bound histone markers.Here, machine learning models are employed to evaluate the accuracy with whichcis-regulatory elements identified by various commonly used sequencing techniques can be predicted by their underlying sequence alone to distinguish betweencis-regulatory activity that is reflective of sequence content versus secondary processes.Models trained and evaluated onD. melanogastersequences identified through DNase-seq and STARR-seq are significantly more accurate than models trained on sequences identified by H3K4me1, H3K4me3, and H3K27ac ChIP-seq, FAIRE-seq, and ATAC-seq. These results suggest that the activity detected by DNase-seq and STARR-seq can be largely explained by underlying DNA sequence, independent of secondary processes. Experimentally, a subset of DNase-seq and H3K4me1 ChIP-seq sequences were tested for enhancer activity using luciferase assays and compared with previous tests performed on STARR-seq sequences. The experimental data indicated that STARR-seq sequences are substantially enriched for enhancer-specific activity, while the DNase-seq and H3K4me1 ChIP-seq sequences are not. Taken together, these results indicate that the DNase-seq approach identifies a broad class of regulatory elements of which enhancers are a subset and the associated data are appropriate for training models for detecting regulatory activity from sequence alone, STARR-seq data are best for training enhancer-specific sequence models, and H3K4me1 ChIP-seq data are not well suited for training and evaluating sequence-based models forcis-regulatory element prediction.Copyright © 2023 Nowling, Njoya, Peters and Riehle."

An increasing number of patients with congenital imprinting disorders (IDs) exhibit aberrant methylation at multiple imprinted loci, multi-locus imprinting disturbance (MLID). We examined MLID and its possible impact on clinical features in patients with IDs. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis (GWMA) using blood leukocyte DNA was performed on 13 patients with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), two patients with Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS), and four controls. HumanMethylation850 BeadChip analysis for 77 iDMRs (809 CpG sites) identified three patients with BWS and one patient with SRS showing additional hypomethylation, other than the disease-related iDMRs, suggestive of MLID. Two regions were aberrantly methylated in at least two patients with BWS showing MLID: PPIEL locus (chromosome 1: 39559298 to 39559744), and FAM50B locus (chromosome 6: 3849096 to 3849469). All patients with BWS- and SRS-MLID did not show any other clinical characteristics associated with additional involved iDMRs. Exome analysis in three patients with BWS who exhibited multiple hypomethylation did not identify any causative variant related to MLID. This study indicates that a genome-wide approach can unravel MLID in patients with an apparently isolated ID. Patients with MLID showed only clinical features related to the original IDs. Long-term follow-up studies in larger cohorts are warranted to evaluate any possible phenotypic consequences of other disturbed imprinted loci.Copyright: © 2023 Kim et al.

In cortical cultured neurons, L1 RNAs are mainly associated to chromatin and interact with the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) protein subunits enhancer of Zeste homolog 2 (Ezh2) and suppressor of zeste 12 (Suz12). L1 RNA silencing influences PRC2's ability to bind a portion of its targets and the deposition of tri-methylated histone H3 (H3K27me3) marks. Our results position L1 RNAs as crucial signalling hubs for genome-wide chromatin remodelling, enabling the fine-tuning of gene expression during brain development and evolution.© 2023.

Our single-molecule real-time sequencing-based methylome analysis revealed multiple AamA-mediated DNA methylation sites and proposed a potent census target motif (TTTRAATTYAAA). Loss of Dam led to modulation of genome-wide gene expression, and several Dam-target sites including the promoter region of thetrmDoperon (rpsP, rimM, trmD,andrplS) were identified through our methylome and transcriptome analyses. AamA methylation also appeared to control the expression of many genes linked to membrane functions (lolAB,lpxO), replication (dnaA) and protein synthesis (trmDoperon) in the strain ATCC 17978. Interestingly, cellular resistance against several antibiotics and ethidium bromide through functions of efflux pumps diminished in the absence of theaamAgene, and the complementation ofaamAgene restored the wild-type phenotypes. Other tested phenotypic traits such as outer-membrane vesicle production, biofilm formation and virulence were also affected in theaamAmutant. Collectively, our data indicated that epigenetic regulation through AamA-mediated DNA methylation of novel target sites mostly in the regulatory regions could contribute significantly to changes in multiple phenotypic traits inA. baumanniiATCC 17978."
"37589453","Epigenetic signature of human immune aging in the GESTALT study.","Elife","Age-associated DNA methylation in blood cells convey information on health status. However, the mechanisms that drive these changes in circulating cells and their relationships to gene regulation are unknown. We identified age-associated DNA methylation sites in six purified blood borne immune cell types (naïve B, naïve CD4+and CD8+T cells, granulocytes, monocytes and NK cells) collected from healthy individuals interspersed over a wide age range. Of the thousands of age-associated sites, only 350 sites were differentially methylated in the same direction in all cell types and validated in an independent longitudinal cohort. Genes close to age-associated hypomethylated sites were enriched for collagen biosynthesis and complement cascade pathways, while genes close to hypermethylated sites mapped to neuronal pathways. In-silico analyses showed that in most cell types, the age-associated hypo- and hypermethylated sites were enriched for ARNT (HIF1β) and REST transcription factor motifs respectively, which are both master regulators of hypoxia response. To conclude, despite spatial heterogeneity, there is a commonality in the putative regulatory role with respect to transcription factor motifs and histone modifications at and around these sites. These features suggest that DNA methylation changes in healthy aging may be adaptive responses to fluctuations of oxygen availability."
"37587790",NA,NA,"Precision medicine relies on the identification of robust disease and risk factor signatures from omics data. However, current knowledge-driven approaches may overlook novel or unexpected phenomena due to the inherent biases in biological knowledge. In this study, we present a data-driven signature discovery workflow for DNA methylation analysis utilizing network-coherent autoencoders (NCAEs) with biologically relevant latent embeddings. First, we explored the architecture space of autoencoders trained on a large-scale pan-tissue compendium (n = 75 272) of human epigenome-wide association studies. We observed the emergence of co-localized patterns in the deep autoencoder latent space representations that corresponded to biological network modules. We determined the NCAE configuration with the strongest co-localization and centrality signals in the human protein interactome. Leveraging the NCAE embeddings, we then trained interpretable deep neural networks for risk factor (aging, smoking) and disease (systemic lupus erythematosus) prediction and classification tasks. Remarkably, our NCAE embedding-based models outperformed existing predictors, revealing novel DNA methylation signatures enriched in gene sets and pathways associated with the studied condition in each case. Our data-driven biomarker discovery workflow provides a generally applicable pipeline to capture relevant risk factor and disease information. By surpassing the limitations of knowledge-driven methods, our approach enhances the understanding of complex epigenetic processes, facilitating the development of more effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.© The Author(s) 2023.

"37587336",NA,NA,"Cells undergo a major epigenome reconfiguration when reprogrammed to human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPS cells). However, the epigenomes of hiPS cells and human embryonic stem (hES) cells differ significantly, which affects hiPS cell function1-8. These differences include epigenetic memory and aberrations that emerge during reprogramming, for which the mechanisms remain unknown. Here we characterized the persistence and emergence of these epigenetic differences by performing genome-wide DNA methylation profiling throughout primed and naive reprogramming of human somatic cells to hiPS cells. We found that reprogramming-induced epigenetic aberrations emerge midway through primed reprogramming, whereas DNA demethylation begins early in naive reprogramming. Using this knowledge, we developed a transient-naive-treatment (TNT) reprogramming strategy that emulates the embryonic epigenetic reset. We show that the epigenetic memory in hiPS cells is concentrated in cell of origin-dependent repressive chromatin marked by H3K9me3, lamin-B1 and aberrant CpH methylation. TNT reprogramming reconfigures these domains to a hES cell-like state and does not disrupt genomic imprinting. Using an isogenic system, we demonstrate that TNT reprogramming can correct the transposable element overexpression and differential gene expression seen in conventional hiPS cells, and that TNT-reprogrammed hiPS and hES cells show similar differentiation efficiencies. Moreover, TNT reprogramming enhances the differentiation of hiPS cells derived from multiple cell types. Thus, TNT reprogramming corrects epigenetic memory and aberrations, producing hiPS cells that are molecularly and functionally more similar to hES cells than conventional hiPS cells. We foresee TNT reprogramming becoming a new standard for biomedical and therapeutic applications and providing a novel system for studying epigenetic memory.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37587247","Epigenome-wide analysis identifies methylome profiles linked to obsessive-compulsive disorder, disease severity, and treatment response.","Mol Psychiatry","Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent mental disorder affecting ~2-3% of the population. This disorder involves genetic and, possibly, epigenetic risk factors. The dynamic nature of epigenetics also presents a promising avenue for identifying biomarkers associated with symptom severity, clinical progression, and treatment response in OCD. We, therefore, conducted a comprehensive case-control investigation using Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip, encompassing 185 OCD patients and 199 controls recruited from two distinct sites in Germany. Rigorous clinical assessments were performed by trained raters employing the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-I). We performed a robust two-step epigenome-wide association study that led to the identification of 305 differentially methylated CpG positions. Next, we validated these findings by pinpointing the optimal set of CpGs that could effectively classify individuals into their respective groups. This approach identified a subset comprising 12 CpGs that overlapped with the 305 CpGs identified in our EWAS. These 12 CpGs are close to or in genes associated with the sweet-compulsive brain hypothesis which proposes that aberrant dopaminergic transmission in the striatum may impair insulin signaling sensitivity among OCD patients. We replicated three of the 12 CpGs signals from a recent independent study conducted on the Han Chinese population, underscoring also the cross-cultural relevance of our findings. In conclusion, our study further supports the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in the pathogenesis of OCD. By elucidating the underlying molecular alterations associated with OCD, our study contributes to advancing our understanding of this complex disorder and may ultimately improve clinical outcomes for affected individuals.© 2023.

"37587104",NA,NA,"Resistance to insecticides in Anopheles mosquitoes threatens the effectiveness of malaria control, but the genetics of resistance are only partially understood. We performed a large scale multi-country genome-wide association study of resistance to two widely used insecticides: deltamethrin and pirimiphos-methyl, using sequencing data from An. gambiae and An. coluzzii from ten locations in West Africa. Resistance was highly multi-genic, multi-allelic and variable between populations. While the strongest and most consistent association with deltamethrin resistance came from Cyp6aa1, this was based on several independent copy number variants (CNVs) in An. coluzzii, and on a non-CNV haplotype in An. gambiae. For pirimiphos-methyl, signals included Ace1, cytochrome P450s, glutathione S-transferases and the nAChR target site of neonicotinoid insecticides. The regions around Cyp9k1 and the Tep family of immune genes showed evidence of cross-resistance to both insecticides. These locally-varying, multi-allelic patterns highlight the challenges involved in genomic monitoring of resistance, and may form the basis for improved surveillance methods.© 2023.

Among SSc patients, there were 10 patients with ILD (SSc with ILD subgroup) and 9 patients without ILD (SSc without ILD subgroup). The genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression level were analyzed by using Illumina 450K methylation chip and Illumina HT-12 v4.0 gene expression profiling chip. The effect of DNA methylation on Wnt/β-catenin and chemokine signal pathways was investigated.Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis identified 71 hypermethylated CpG sites and 98 hypomethylated CpG sites in the SSc with ILD subgroup compared with the SSc without ILD subgroup. Transcriptome analysis distinguished 164 upregulated genes and 191 downregulated genes in the SSc with ILD subgroup as compared with the SSc without ILD subgroup. In PBMCs of the SSc group, 35 genes in Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway were hypomethylated, while frizzled-1 (FZD1), mitogen-activated protein kinase 9 (MAPK9), mothers against DPP homolog 2 (SMAD2), transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2), and wingless-type MMTV integration site family, member 5B (WNT5B) mRNA expressions were upregulated as compared with the control group (allP<0.05). Compared with the SSc without ILD subgroup, the mRNA expressions of dickkopf homolog 2 (DKK2),FZD1,MAPK9were upregulated in the SSc with ILD subgroup, but the differences were not statistically significant (allP>0.05). In PBMCs of the SSc group, 38 genes in chemokine signaling pathway were hypomethylated, while β-arrestin 1 (ARRB1), C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10), C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 16 (CXCL16),FGR, and neutrophil cytosolic factor 1C (NCF1C) mRNA expressions were upregulated as compared with the control group (allP<0.05). Compared with the SSc without ILD subgroup, the mRNA expressions ofARRB1,CXCL10,CXCL16were upregulated in the SSc with ILD subgroup, but the differences were not statistically significant (allP>0.05).There are differences in DNA methylation and transcriptome profiles between SSc with ILD and SSc without ILD.

Most people completing suicide have previous psychiatric conditions, and those with psychotic and mood disorders are particularly vulnerable. Unfortunately, there are currently no biomarkers available for accurately detecting suicidal ideation. Given the genetic and environmental factors that play a role in suicidal ideation, we attempted to determine epigenetic modifications, specifically DNA methylation, in response to changes in suicidal ideation. Using a longitudinal study design, 31 participants with schizophrenia spectrum disorders were interviewed at a baseline visit and again at a follow-up visit 3-12 months later. Current suicidal ideation was recorded at both visits with the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale and the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation, and whole blood was collected for methylation analysis. Our analysis shows a significant negative correlation between cg26910920 methylation and increasing Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale scores and a positive correlation between cg13673029 methylation and increasing Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation scores. This pilot study indicates that there is  the possibility  that DNA methylation can respond to changes in suicidal ideation over time and potentially be used as a biomarker of suicidal ideation in the future.© 2023.

Mutations in DNMT1 have been associated with autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia, deafness, and narcolepsy (ADCA-DN). We used fibroblasts, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and induced neurons (iNs) generated from patients with ADCA-DN and controls, to explore the epigenomic and transcriptomic effects of mutations in DNMT1. We show cell-type specific changes in gene expression and DNA methylation patterns. DNA methylation and gene expression changes were negatively correlated in iPSCs and iNs. In addition, we identified a group of genes associated with clinical phenotypes of ADCA-DN, including PDGFB and PRDM8 for cerebellar ataxia, psychosis and dementia, and NR2F1 for deafness and optic atrophy. Furthermore, ZFP57, which is required to maintain gene imprinting through DNA methylation during early development, was hypomethylated in promoters and exhibited upregulated expression in patients with ADCA-DN in both iPSC and iNs. Our results provide insight into the functions of DNMT1 and the molecular changes associated with ADCA-DN, with potential implications for genes associated with related phenotypes.© The Author(s) 2023.

Because these changes are reversible, they have potential in developing novel therapeutics. Currently, seven pharmaceutical agents targeting epigenetic changes are FDA approved and commercially available for treatment of certain cancers. However, studies investigating epigenetics in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) have not been undertaken previously in the United States.The goal of this study was to investigate sinonasal DNA methylation patterns in CRS versus controls, to discern environmentally-induced epigenetic changes impacting CRS subjects.Ethmoidal samples from CRS and inferior turbinate mucosal tissue samples from controls without CRS were studied. DNA methylation was studied by Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing. RADMeth® biostatistical package was used to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between CRS and controls. Ingenuity Pathway analysis of DMRs was performed to identify top upstream regulators and canonical pathways. Ninety-three samples from 64 CRS subjects (36 CRSwNP; 28 CRSsNP) and 29 controls were studied. CRS and control samples differed in 13 662 CpGs sites and 1381 DMRs. Top upstream regulators identified included: 1. CRS versus controls: TGFB1, TNF, TP53, DGCR8, and beta-estradiol. 2. CRSwNP versus controls: TGFB1, CTNNB1, lipopolysaccharide, ID2, and TCF7L2. 3. CRSsNP versus controls: MYOD1, acetone, ID2, ST8SIA4, and LEPR.Differential patterns of methylation were identified between controls and CRS, CRSwNP, and CRSsNP. Epigenetic, environmentally-induced changes related to novel, inflammatory, immunologic, and remodeling pathways appear to affect epithelial integrity, cell proliferation, homeostasis, vascular permeability, and other yet uncharacterized pathways and genes."

In this paper, we performed genome-wide identification of bananaGLRgene family based on banana genomic data. Moreover, we analyzed the basic physicochemical properties, gene structure, conserved motifs, promotercis-acting elements, evolutionary relationships, and used real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to verify the expression patterns of someGLRfamily members under low temperature of 4 ℃ and different hormone treatments. The results showed that there were 19MaGLRfamily members inMusa acuminata, 16MbGLRfamily members inMusa balbisianaand 14MiGLRfamily members inMusa itinerans. Most of the members were stable proteins and had signal peptides, all of them had 3-6 transmembrane structures. Prediction of subcellular localization indicated that all of them were localized on the plasma membrane and irregularly distributed on the chromosome. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that bananaGLRscould be divided into 3 subclades. The results of promotercis-acting elements and transcription factor binding site prediction showed that there were multiple hormone- and stress-related response elements and 18 TFBS in bananaGLR. RT-qPCR analysis showed thatMaGLR1.1andMaGLR3.5responded positively to low temperature stress and were significantly expressed in abscisic acid/methyl jasmonate treatments. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that GLR, a highly conserved family of ion channels, may play an important role in the growth and development process and stress resistance of banana."

In this study, the role of chromatin remodeling factor inositol requiring 80 (INO80) was investigated. Although INO80 regulates transcription by altering the chromatin structure at the nucleosome level, its role in the kidney remains unknown. We demonstrated that the expression of INO80 in impaired kidneys decreased in rats with unilateral urethral obstruction. We investigated INO80 expression in a proximal tubular cell line and observed that its expression decreased under hypoxic condition. Additionally, INO80 knockdown promoted apoptosis, suggesting that INO80 plays a role in inhibiting tubular cell apoptosis. We identified downstream target genes of INO80 via genome-wide analysis using RNA-sequences and found that the expression of apoptosis-related genes, such as TP53 and E2F1, and pro-apoptotic genes, such as PMAIP1, increased upon INO80 knockdown. ChIP-qPCR of the loci of PMAIP1 showed that the amount of H2A.Z. increased instead of decreasing the amount of H2A when INO80 was knocked down. These results indicated that INO80 plays a role in the exchange of H2A.Z. for H2A in the promoter region of PMAIP1 in tubular cells to inhibit apoptosis during CKD progression.© 2023.

Here, we identify a family of gene clusters (the type 1mlpgene clusters (MGCs)) that encodes homologs of the soluble coenzyme M methyltransferases (SCMTs) involved in methylotrophic methanogenesis and is widespread in bacteria and archaea. Type 1 MGCs are expressed and regulated in a number of medically, environmentally, and industrially important organisms, making them likely to be physiologically relevant. Enzyme annotation and analysis of genomic context suggests these gene clusters are likely to play a role in methyl-sulfur and/or methyl-selenide metabolism in numerous anoxic environments, including the human gut microbiome. Notably, we propose that type 1 MGCs could participate in selenium and methionine salvage pathways that could impact sulfur and selenium cycling in diverse, anoxic environments."

In this study, we investigated the genome-wide DNA methylation patterns among patients with CRC. The methylation data of 1 unmatched normal, 142 adjacent normal, and 294 tumor samples were analyzed. We identified 40,003 differentially methylated positions with 6,933 (79.8%) hypermethylated and 16,145 (51.6%) hypomethylated probes in the genic region. Hypermethylated probes were predominantly found in promoter-like regions, CpG islands, and N shore sites; hypomethylated probes were enriched in open-sea regions. CRC tumors were categorized into three CIMP subgroups, with 90 (30.6%) in the CIMP-high (CIMP-H), 115 (39.1%) in the CIMP-low (CIMP-L), and 89 (30.3%) in the non-CIMP group. The CIMP-H group was associated with microsatellite instability-high tumors, hypermethylation of MLH1, older age, and right-sided tumors.

UHRF1 and DNMT1 are both crucial for regulating genome-wide maintenance of DNA methylation. Specifically, it is well known that hypermethylation is crucial characteristic of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, the mechanism underlying how DNA methylation regulates the differentiation of AML cells, including THP-1 is not fully elucidated. In this study, we report that UHRF1 or DNMT1 depletion enhances the phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-induced differentiation of THP-1 cells. Transcriptome analysis and genome-wide methylation array results showed that depleting UHRF1 or DNMT1 induced changes that made THP-1 cells highly sensitive to PMA. Furthermore, knockdown of UHRF1 or DNMT1 impeded solid tumor formation in xenograft mouse model. These findings suggest that UHRF1 and DNMT1 play a pivotal role in regulating differentiation and proliferation of THP-1 cells and targeting these proteins may improve the efficiency of differentiation therapy in AML patients.© 2023.

The appropriate design of studies is essential for their quality, successful execution, and interpretation. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the ""gold standard"" for intervention studies. However, the most recent large-scale (up to 25,000 participants), long-term RCTs involving vitamin D3did not provide any statistically significant primary results. This may be because they are designed similarly to RCTs of a therapeutic drug but not of a nutritional compound and that only a limited set of parameters per individual were determined. We propose an alternative concept using the segregation of study participants into different groups of responsiveness to vitamin D3supplementation and in parallel measuring a larger set of genome-wide parameters over multiple time points. This is in accordance with recently developed mechanistic modeling approaches that do not require a large number of study participants, as in the case of statistical modeling of the results of a RCT. Our experience is based on the vitamin D intervention trials VitDmet, VitDbol, and VitDHiD, which allowed us to distinguish the study participants into high, mid, and low vitamin D responders. In particular, investigating the vulnerable group of low vitamin D responders will provide future studies with more conclusive results both on the clinical and molecular benefits of vitamin D3supplementation. In conclusion, our approach suggests a paradigm shift towards detailed investigations of transcriptome and epigenome-wide parameters of a limited set of individuals, who, due to a longitudinal design, can act as their own controls."

Previously, we employed mass spectrometry to identify histone modifications such as H3K27ac and H3K36me3 in the model diatomPhaeodactylum tricornutum, which have been shown to be important for transcriptional activation in animal and plant species. To further investigate their evolutionary implications, we utilized chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-Seq) and explored their genome-wide distribution inP. tricornutum. Our study aimed to determine their role in transcriptional regulation of genes and transposable elements (TEs) and their co-occurrence with other histone marks. Our results revealed that H3K27ac and H3K36me3 were predominantly localized in promoters and genic regions indicating a high conservation pattern with studies of the same marks in plants and animals. Furthermore, we report the diversity of genes encoding H3 lysine 36 (H3K36) trimethylation-specific methyltransferase in microalgae leveraging diverse sequencing resources including the Marine Microbial Eukaryote Transcriptome Sequencing Project database (MMETSP). Our study expands the repertoire of epigenetic marks in a model microalga and provides valuable insights into the evolutionary context of epigenetic-mediated gene regulation.

To dissect the epigenetic switch enabling the programming of a cancer cell, we carried out wide genome analysis of Histone 3 (H3) modifications during osteogenic differentiation of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. The most significant modifications concerned H3K27me2/3, H3K9me2, H3K79me1/2, and H3K4me1 that specify the process of healthy adult stem cell differentiation. Next, we translated these findings in vivo, assessing H3K27, H3K9, and H3K79 methylation states in biopsies derived from patients affected by basalioma, head and neck carcinoma, and bladder tumors. Interestingly, we found a drastic decrease in H3K9me2 and H3K79me3 in cancer specimens with respect to their healthy counterparts and also a positive correlation between these two epigenetic flags in all three tumors. Therefore, we suggest that elevated global levels of H3K9me2 and H3K79me3, present in normal differentiated cells but lost in malignancy, may reflect an important epigenetic barrier to tumorigenesis. This suggestion is further corroborated, at least in part, by the deranged expression of the most relevant H3 modifier enzymes, as revealed by bioinformatic analysis. Overall, our study indicates that the simultaneous occurrence of H3K9me2 and H3K79me3 is fundamental to ensure the integrity of differentiated tissues and, thus, their combined evaluation may represent a novel diagnostic marker and potential therapeutic target."

The maxillary molar develops before the mandibular molar in class II malocclusion, which affects 15% of the population in the United States. With a retrusive mandible, patients typically have a convex profile. The goal of this study is to classify the skeletal and dental variability present in class II malocclusion, to reduce heterogeneity, present the current clinical treatment strategies, to summarize the previously published findings of genetic analysis, discuss these findings and their constraints, and finally, propose a comprehensive roadmap to facilitate investigations aimed at determining the genetic bases of malocclusion development using a variety of genomic approaches. To further comprehend the hereditary components involved in the onset and progression of class II malocclusion, a novel animal model for class II malocclusion should be developed while considering the variety of the human population. To overcome the constraints of the previous studies, here, we propose to conduct novel research on humans with the support of mouse models to produce contentious findings. We believe that carrying out a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on a large human cohort to search for significant genes and their modifiers; an epigenetics-wide association study (EWAS); RNA-seq analysis; integrating GWAS and the expression of quantitative trait loci (eQTL); and the testing of microRNAs, small RNAs, and long noncoding RNAs in tissues related to the skeletal class II malocclusion (SCIIMO) phenotype, such as mandibular bone, gum, and jaw in humans and the collaborative cross (CC) mouse model, will identify novel genes and genetic factors affecting this phenotype. We anticipate discovering novel genetic elements to advance our knowledge of how this malocclusion phenotype develops and open the venue for the early identification of patients carrying the susceptible genetic factors so that we can offer early prevention treatment strategies."

Current therapeutic interventions have limited efficacy. Understanding the epigenetic changes underlying stunting will elucidate molecular mechanisms and likely lead to new therapies.We profiled the repressive mark histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) genome-wide in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 18-week-old infants (n = 15) and mothers (n = 14) enrolled in the PROVIDE study established in an urban slum in Bangladesh. We associated H3K9me3 levels within individual loci as well as genome-wide with anthropometric measurements and other biomarkers of stunting and performed functional annotation of differentially affected regions. Despite the relatively small number of samples from this vulnerable population, we observed globally elevated H3K9me3 levels were associated with poor linear growth between birth and one year of age. A large proportion of the differentially methylated genes code for proteins targeting viral mRNA and highly significant regions were enriched in transposon elements with potential regulatory roles in immune system activation and cytokine production. Maternal data show a similar trend with child's anthropometry; however, these trends lack statistical significance to infer an intergenerational relationship.We speculate that high H3K9me3 levels may result in poor linear growth by repressing genes involved in immune system activation. Importantly, changes to H3K9me3 were detectable before the overt manifestation of stunting and therefore may be valuable as new biomarkers of stunting.© 2023.

A large proportion of R-loops (RNA:DNA hybrids) had been unexpectedly identified within Arabidopsis pericentromeric heterochromatin with unknown functions. Through a genome-wide R-loop profiling screen, we find that DDM1 (decrease in DNA methylation 1) is the primary restrictor of pericentromeric R-loops via its RNA:DNA helicase activity. Low levels of pericentromeric R-loops resolved by DDM1 cotranscriptionally can facilitate constitutive heterochromatin silencing. Furthermore, we demonstrate that DDM1 physically excludes histone H2A variant H2A.Z and promotes H2A.W deposition for faithful heterochromatin initiation soon after R-loop clearance. The dual functions of DDM1 in R-loop resolution and H2A.Z eviction are essential for sperm nuclei structure maintenance in mature pollen. Our work unravels the cotranscriptional R-loop resolution coupled with accurate H2A variants deposition is the primary step of constitutive heterochromatin silencing in Arabidopsis, which might be conserved across eukaryotes."
"37563670",NA,NA,"DNA methylation analysis has proven to be a powerful tool for age assessment. However, the implementation of epigenetic age prediction in diagnostics or routine forensic casework requires appropriate laboratory methods. In this study, we aimed to compare the performance of large-scale DNA methylation analysis protocols that show promise in terms of accuracy, throughput, multiplexing capacity, and high sensitivity.The protocols were designed to target a predefined panel of 161 genomic CG/CA sites from four known estimators of epigenetic age-related parameters, optimized and validated using artificially methylated controls or blood samples. We successfully targeted 96% of these loci using two enrichment protocols: Ion AmpliSeq™, an amplicon-based method integrated with Ion Torrent S5, and SureSelectXTMethyl-Seq, a hybridization-based method followed by MiSeq FGx sequencing. Both protocols demonstrated high accuracy and robustness. Although hybridization assays have greater multiplexing capabilities, the best overall performance was observed for the amplicon-based protocol with the lowest variability in DNA methylation at 25 ng of starting DNA, mean observed marker coverage of ~ 6.7 k reads, and accuracy of methylation quantification with a mean absolute difference between observed and expected methylation beta value of 0.054. The Ion AmpliSeq method correlated strongly with genome-scale EPIC microarray data (R = 0.91) and showed superiority in terms of methylation measurement accuracy. Method-to-method bias was accounted for by the use of linear transformation, which provided a highly accurate prediction of calendar age with a mean absolute error of less than 5 years for the VISAGE and Hannum age clocks used. The pace of aging (PoAm) and the mortality risk score (MRS) estimators included in our panel represent next-generation clocks, were found to have low to moderate correlations with the VISAGE and Hannum models (R < 0.75), and thus may capture different aspects of epigenetic aging.We propose a laboratory tool that allows the quantification of DNA methylation in cytosines underlying four different clocks, thus providing broad information on epigenetic aging while maintaining a reasonable number of CpG markers, opening the way to a wide range of applications in forensics, medicine, and healthcare.© 2023.

The present study describes an eQTM resource of CpG-transcript pairs derived from whole blood DNA methylation and RNA sequencing gene expression data in 2115 Framingham Heart Study participants. We identified 70,047 significant cis CpG-transcript pairs at p < 1E-7 where the top most significant eGenes (i.e., gene transcripts associated with a CpG) were enriched in biological pathways related to cell signaling, and for 1208 clinical traits (enrichment false discovery rate [FDR] ≤ 0.05). We also identified 246,667 significant trans CpG-transcript pairs at p < 1E-14 where the top most significant eGenes were enriched in biological pathways related to activation of the immune response, and for 1191 clinical traits (enrichment FDR ≤ 0.05). Independent and external replication of the top 1000 significant cis and trans CpG-transcript pairs was completed in the Women's Health Initiative and Jackson Heart Study cohorts. Using significant cis CpG-transcript pairs, we identified significant mediation of the association between CpG sites and cardiometabolic traits through gene expression and identified shared genetic regulation between CpGs and transcripts associated with cardiometabolic traits. In conclusion, we developed a robust and powerful resource of whole blood eQTM CpG-transcript pairs that can help inform future functional studies that seek to understand the molecular basis of disease.© 2023.

"37563129","Copy number architectures define treatment-mediated selection of lethal prostate cancer clones.","Nat Commun","Despite initial responses to hormone treatment, metastatic prostate cancer invariably evolves to a lethal state. To characterize the intra-patient evolutionary relationships of metastases that evade treatment, we perform genome-wide copy number profiling and bespoke approaches targeting the androgen receptor (AR) on 167 metastatic regions from 11 organs harvested post-mortem from 10 men who died from prostate cancer. We identify diverse and patient-unique alterations clustering around the AR in metastases from every patient with evidence of independent acquisition of related genomic changes within an individual and, in some patients, the co-existence of AR-neutral clones. Using the genomic boundaries of pan-autosome copy number changes, we confirm a common clone of origin across metastases and diagnostic biopsies, and identified in individual patients, clusters of metastases occupied by dominant clones with diverged autosomal copy number alterations. These autosome-defined clusters are characterized by cluster-specific AR gene architectures, and in two index cases are topologically more congruent than by chance (p-values 3.07 × 10-8 and 6.4 × 10-4). Integration with anatomical sites suggests patterns of spread and points of genomic divergence. Here, we show that copy number boundaries identify treatment-selected clones with putatively distinct lethal trajectories.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."

However, the comprehensive mechanisms underlying the developmental stage of non-target organisms remain largely unexplored. In this study, zebrafish embryos were firstly exposed to CYT (0.06, 0.12, and 0.20 ng/mL, referred to as CYTL, CYTM, and CYTH, respectively) from 2 hpf (hours post fertilization) to 30 dpf (days post fertilization). No developmental toxicity was observed in the CYTL and CYTM groups, except for induced deformed phenotypes in the CYTM group at 120 hpf. However, exposure to CYTH resulted in significant reductions in spontaneous movement (24 hpf), heart rate (48 hpf), hatching rate (48 and 72 hpf), body weight (30 dpf), whole body length (30 dpf), and locomotion (30 dpf). Additionally, CYTH exposure induced morphological malformations, including spinal curvature, pericardial edema, and tail curvature in zebrafish larvae. Moreover, CYTH treatment induced apoptosis, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and resulted in significant reductions in free T3, cholesterol, estradiol, and testosterone levels in zebrafish larvae, while free T4 levels were increased. RNA-Seq analysis indicated that CYTH exposure led to significant alterations in the genome-wide gene expression profiles of zebrafish, particularly in the thyroid hormone and steroid biosynthesis signaling pathways, indicating endocrine disruption. Furthermore, CYTH exposure induced global DNA hypomethylation, reduced S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) levels and the SAM/S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) ratio, elevated SAH levels, and suppressed the mRNA expression of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) while also downregulating DNMT1 at both the gene and protein levels in zebrafish larvae. Overall, this study partially elucidated the developmental toxicity and endocrine disruption caused by CYT in zebrafish, providing evidence of the environmental hazards associated with this acaricide.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

It was recently introduced in the 5th World Health Organization classification of central nervous system tumors of 2021. Clinical data on this tumor is scarce. This is a case series, which presents the first clinical experience with this entity. We compiled a retrospective case series on pHGG patients treated between 2015 and 2022 at our institution. Data collected include patients' clinical course, surgical procedure, histopathology, genome-wide DNA methylation analysis, imaging and adjuvant therapy. Eight pHGG were identified, ranging in age from 8 to 71 years. On MRI tumors presented with an unspecific intensity profile, T1w hypo- to isointense and T2w hyperintense, with inhomogeneous contrast enhancement, often with rim enhancement. Three patients died of the disease, with overall survival of 19, 28 and 30 months. Four patients were alive at the time of the last follow-up, 4, 5, 6 and 79 months after the initial surgery. One patient was lost to follow-up. Findings indicate that pHGG prevalence might be underestimated in the elderly population.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Methylation levels of DNA CpG sites in PBMCs were analyzed using Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip DNA microarrays.Seven differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were identified, of which 3 were hypermethylated (cg02981003, cg18486102, cg19533582) and 4 were hypomethylated (cg16814680, cg1964802, cg18584440, cg08291996) during RRMS relapse. Five DMPs are located in protein-coding genes (GPR123,FAIM2,BTNL2,ZNF8,ASAP2), one in microRNA gene (MIR548N), and one in an intergenic region. For all identified DMPs, we observed a change in DNA methylation levels of more than 20% (range 20.2-57.5%). Hierarchical clustering of DNA samples on the heatmap shows their clear aggregation into separate clusters corresponding to RRMS patients in the stages of relapse and remission.For the first time it was shown that during relapse and remission of RRMS there are differences in the DNA methylation profile that allow discrimination between these clinical stages. These data indicate the involvement of the epigenetic mechanism of DNA methylation in the activation of the pathological process in RRMS."

Accordingly, a number of investigators take the position that under-treatment with psychostimulants, especially in children and adolescence, will result in continued ADHD symptomatology including future Substance Use Disorder (SUD). However, other researchers and clinicians believe otherwise and espouse laudable arguments for caution and prolonged methamphetamine treatment. While there is ongoing controversy of the role of genetics and epigenetics linked to ADHD, it seems clear that a number of dopaminergic genes and their risk polymorphisms act as DNA antecedents impacted by epigenetic induced methylation. Our hypothesis and literature review suggest that one possible solution is to embrace non addictive interventions to induce global dopamine homeostasis."

"37431891","Decoding the genetic and chemical basis of sexual attractiveness in parasitic wasps.","Elife","Attracting and securing potential mating partners is of fundamental importance for reproduction. Therefore, signaling sexual attractiveness is expected to be tightly coordinated in communication systems synchronizing senders and receivers. Chemical signaling has permeated through all taxa of life as the earliest and most widespread form of communication and is particularly prevalent in insects. However, it has been notoriously difficult to decipher how exactly information related to sexual signaling is encoded in complex chemical profiles. Similarly, our knowledge of the genetic basis of sexual signaling is very limited and usually restricted to a few case studies with comparably simple pheromonal communication mechanisms. The present study jointly addresses these two knowledge gaps by characterizing two fatty acid synthase genes that most likely evolved by tandem gene duplication and that simultaneously impact sexual attractiveness and complex chemical surface profiles in parasitic wasps. Gene knockdown in female wasps dramatically reduces their sexual attractiveness coinciding with a drastic decrease in male courtship and copulation behavior. Concordantly, we found a striking shift of methyl-branching patterns in the female surface pheromonal compounds, which we subsequently demonstrate to be the main cause for the greatly reduced male mating response. Intriguingly, this suggests a potential coding mechanism for sexual attractiveness mediated by specific methyl-branching patterns in complex cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profiles. So far, the genetic underpinnings of methyl-branched CHCs are not well understood despite their high potential for encoding information. Our study sheds light on how biologically relevant information can be encoded in complex chemical profiles and on the genetic basis of sexual attractiveness.© 2023, Sun et al."

We conducted a case-control study in China including 107 paired participants and comprehensively detected 12 plasma one-carbon metabolism-related micronutrients. Genomic DNA methylation was measured using an 850 K chip and differential methylation probes (DMPs) were identified. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to estimate the associations between plasma micronutrients and the odds of breast cancer. The mediation of selected DMPs in micronutrient breast cancer associations was examined using mediation analyses. An inverse association of plasma folate, methionine cycling-related micronutrients (methionine, S-adenosylmethionine, and S-adenosylhomocysteine), and all micronutrients in the choline metabolism and enzymatic factor groups, and a positive association of methionine cycling-related cysteine with breast cancer risk were observed. Nine micronutrients (methionine, cysteine, SAM, folate, choline, betaine, P5P, vitamins B2, and B12) were related to global or probe-specific methylation levels (p< 0.05). The selected DMPs mediated the micronutrient breast cancer associations with an average mediation proportion of 36.43%.

Women with normal pre-pregnancy BMI were allocated into two groups: adequate gestational weight gain (AGWG,n= 45) and excessive gestational weight gain (EGWG,n= 30). Foetal and neonatal body composition was evaluated via ultrasound and plethysmography, respectively. DNAm was assessed in maternal blood using Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip arrays. Linear regression models were used to explore the associations between DNAm and foetal and neonatal body composition.Maternal weight, GWG, neonatal weight, and fat mass were higher in the EGWG group. Analysis of DNAm identified 46 differentially methylated positions and 11 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between the EGWG and AGWG groups. Nine human phenotypes were enriched for these 11 DMRs located in 13 genes (EMILIN1,HOXA5,CPT1B,CLDN9,ZFP57,BRCA1,POU5F1,ANKRD33,HLA-B,RANBP17,ZMYND11,DIP2C,TMEM232), highlighting the terms insulin resistance, and hyperglycaemia. Maternal DNAm was associated with foetal total thigh and arm tissues and subcutaneous thigh and arm fat, as well as with neonatal fat mass percentage and fat mass.The methylation pattern in the EGWG group indicated a risk for developing chronic diseases and involvement of maternal DNAm in foetal lean and fat mass and in neonatal fat mass."

Environmental factors, including pesticides, have been reported to increase the risk of developing the disease. Growing evidence suggests epigenetic changes are key mechanisms by which these environmental factors act upon gene regulation, in disease-relevant cell types. We present a systematic review critically appraising and summarising the current body of evidence of the relationship between epigenetic mechanisms and environmental risk factors in PD to inform future research in this area. Epigenetic studies of relevant environmental risk factors in animal and cell models have yielded promising results, however, research in humans is just emerging. While published studies in humans are currently relatively limited, the importance of the field for the elucidation of molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis opens clear and promising avenues for the future of PD research. Carefully designed epidemiological studies carried out in PD patients hold great potential to uncover disease-relevant gene regulatory mechanisms. Therefore, to advance this burgeoning field, we recommend broadening the scope of investigations to include more environmental exposures, increasing sample sizes, focusing on disease-relevant cell types, and recruiting more diverse cohorts.© 2023.

"37582912","BPIFB4 and its longevity-associated haplotype protect from cardiac ischemia in humans and mice.","Cell Death Dis","Long-living individuals (LLIs) escape age-related cardiovascular complications until the very last stage of life. Previous studies have shown that a Longevity-Associated Variant (LAV) of the BPI Fold Containing Family B Member 4 (BPIFB4) gene correlates with an extraordinarily prolonged life span. Moreover, delivery of the LAV-BPIFB4 gene exerted therapeutic action in murine models of atherosclerosis, limb ischemia, diabetic cardiomyopathy, and aging. We hypothesize that downregulation of BPIFB4 expression marks the severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) in human subjects, and supplementation of the LAV-BPIFB4 protects the heart from ischemia. In an elderly cohort with acute myocardial infarction (MI), patients with three-vessel CAD were characterized by lower levels of the natural logarithm (Ln) of peripheral blood BPIFB4 (p = 0.0077). The inverse association between Ln BPIFB4 and three-vessel CAD was confirmed by logistic regression adjusting for confounders (Odds Ratio = 0.81, p = 0.0054). Moreover, in infarcted mice, a single administration of LAV-BPIFB4 rescued cardiac function and vascularization. In vitro studies showed that LAV-BPIFB4 protein supplementation exerted chronotropic and inotropic actions on induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes. In addition, LAV-BPIFB4 inhibited the pro-fibrotic phenotype in human cardiac fibroblasts. These findings provide a strong rationale and proof of concept evidence for treating CAD with the longevity BPIFB4 gene/protein.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37597113","Insights into ageing rates comparison across tissues from recalibrating cerebellum DNA methylation clock.","Geroscience","DNA methylation (DNAm)-based age clocks have been studied extensively as a biomarker of human ageing and a risk factor for age-related diseases. Despite different tissues having vastly different rates of proliferation, it is still largely unknown whether they age at different rates. It was previously reported that the cerebellum ages slowly; however, this claim was drawn from a single clock using a relatively small sample size and so warrants further investigation. We collected the largest cerebellum DNAm dataset (N = 752) to date. We found the respective epigenetic ages are all severely underestimated by six representative DNAm age clocks, with the underestimation effects more pronounced in the four clocks whose training datasets do not include brain-related tissues. We identified 613 age-associated CpGs in the cerebellum, which accounts for only 14.5% of the number found in the middle temporal gyrus from the same population (N = 404). From the 613 cerebellum age-associated CpGs, we built a highly accurate age prediction model for the cerebellum named CerebellumClockspecific(Pearson correlation=0.941, MAD=3.18 years). Ageing rate comparisons based on the two tissue-specific clocks constructed on the 201 overlapping age-associated CpGs support the cerebellum has younger DNAm age. Nevertheless, we built BrainCortexClock to prove a single DNAm clock is able to unbiasedly estimate DNAm ages of both cerebellum and cerebral cortex, when they are adequately and equally represented in the training dataset. Comparing ageing rates across tissues using DNA methylation multi-tissue clocks is flawed. The large underestimation of age prediction for cerebellums by previous clocks mainly reflects the improper usage of these age clocks. There exist strong and consistent ageing effects on the cerebellar methylome, and we suggest the smaller number of age-associated CpG sites in cerebellum is largely attributed to its extremely low average cell replication rates.© 2023.

The evolutionary impacts of such intergenerational effects are therefore of considerable interest. Our group previously showed in a model of daily stress that glucocorticoid treatment of adult male mouse breeders prior to conception leads to increased anxiety-related behaviours in male offspring. Here, we aimed to understand the transgenerational effects of paternal stress exposure on the social behaviour of progeny and its potential influence on reproductive success.We assessed social parameters including social reward, male attractiveness and social dominance, in the offspring (F1) and grand-offspring (F2). We report that paternal corticosterone treatment was associated with increased display of subordination towards other male mice. Those mice were unexpectedly more attractive to female mice while expressing reduced levels of the key rodent pheromone Darcin, contrary to its conventional role in driving female attraction. We investigated the epigenetic regulation of major urinary protein (Mup) expression by performing the first Oxford Nanopore direct methylation of sperm DNA in a mouse model of stress, but found no differences in Mup genes that could be attributed to corticosterone-treatment. Furthermore, no overt differences of the prefrontal cortex transcriptome were found in F1 offspring, implying that peripheral mechanisms are likely contributing to the phenotypic differences. Interestingly, no phenotypic differences were observed in the F2 grand-offspring.Overall, our findings highlight the potential of moderate paternal stress to affect intergenerational (mal)adaptive responses, informing future studies of adaptiveness in rodents, humans and other species.© 2023.

"37633918","Associations between nutrients in one-carbon metabolism and fetal DNA methylation in pregnancies with or without gestational diabetes mellitus.","Clin Epigenetics","Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), characterized by hyperglycemia that develops during pregnancy, increases the risk of fetal macrosomia, childhood obesity and cardiometabolic disorders later in life. This process has been attributed partly to DNA methylation modifications in growth and stress-related pathways. Nutrients involved with one-carbon metabolism (OCM), such as folate, choline, betaine, and vitamin B12, provide methyl groups for DNA methylation of these pathways. Therefore, this study aimed to determine whether maternal OCM nutrient intakes and levels modified fetal DNA methylation and in turn altered fetal growth patterns in pregnancies with and without GDM.In this prospective study at a single academic institution from September 2016 to June 2019, we recruited 76 pregnant women with and without GDM at 25-33 weeks gestational age and assessed their OCM nutrient intake by diet recalls and measured maternal blood OCM nutrient levels. We also collected placenta and cord blood samples at delivery to examine fetal tissue DNA methylation of the genes that modify fetal growth and stress response such as insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). We analyzed the association between maternal OCM nutrients and fetal DNA methylation using a generalized linear mixed model. Our results demonstrated that maternal choline intake was positively correlated with cord blood CRH methylation levels in both GDM and non-GDM pregnancies (r = 0.13, p = 0.007). Further, the downstream stress hormone cortisol regulated by CRH was inversely associated with maternal choline intake (r = - 0.36, p = 0.021). Higher maternal betaine intake and serum folate levels were associated with lower cord blood and placental IGF2 DNA methylation (r = - 0.13, p = 0.049 and r = - 0.065, p = 0.034, respectively) in both GDM and non-GDM pregnancies. Further, there was an inverse association between maternal betaine intake and birthweight of infants (r = - 0.28, p = 0.015).In conclusion, we observed a complex interrelationship between maternal OCM nutrients and fetal DNA methylation levels regardless of GDM status, which may, epigenetically, program molecular pathways related to fetal growth and stress response.© 2023.

"37609328",NA,NA,"Young blood plasma is known to confer beneficial effects on various organs in mice and rats. However, it was not known whether plasma from young pigs rejuvenates old rat tissues at the epigenetic level; whether it alters the epigenetic clock, which is a highly accurate molecular biomarker of aging. To address this question, we developed and validated six different epigenetic clocks for rat tissues that are based on DNA methylation values derived from n=613 tissue samples. As indicated by their respective names, the rat pan-tissue clock can be applied to DNA methylation profiles from all rat tissues, while the rat brain-, liver-, and blood clocks apply to the corresponding tissue types. We also developed two epigenetic clocks that apply to both human and rat tissues by adding n=1366 human tissue samples to the training data. We employed these six rat clocks to investigate the rejuvenation effects of a porcine plasma fraction treatment in different rat tissues. The treatment more than halved the epigenetic ages of blood, heart, and liver tissue. A less pronounced, but statistically significant, rejuvenation effect could be observed in the hypothalamus. The treatment was accompanied by progressive improvement in the function of these organs as ascertained through numerous biochemical/physiological biomarkers and behavioral responses to assess cognitive functions. An immunoglobulin G (IgG) N-glycosylation pattern shift from pro-to anti-inflammatory also indicated reversal of glycan aging. Overall, this study demonstrates that a young porcine plasma-derived treatment markedly reverses aging in rats according to epigenetic clocks, IgG glycans, and other biomarkers of aging."
"37593374","Longitudinal study of epigenetic aging and its relationship with brain aging and cognitive skills in young adulthood.","Front Aging Neurosci","The proportion of older adults within society is sharply increasing and a better understanding of how we age starts to be critical. However, given the paucity of longitudinal studies with both neuroimaging and epigenetic data, it remains largely unknown whether the speed of the epigenetic clock changes over the life course and whether any such changes are proportional to changes in brain aging and cognitive skills. To fill these knowledge gaps, we conducted a longitudinal study of a prenatal birth cohort, studied epigenetic aging across adolescence and young adulthood, and evaluated its relationship with brain aging and cognitive outcomes.DNA methylation was assessed using the Illumina EPIC Platform in adolescence, early and late 20 s, DNA methylation age was estimated using Horvath's epigenetic clock, and epigenetic age gap (EpiAGE) was calculated as DNA methylation age residualized for batch, chronological age and the proportion of epithelial cells. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was acquired in both the early 20 s and late 20 s using the same 3T Prisma MRI scanner and brain age was calculated using the Neuroanatomical Age Prediction using R (NAPR) platform. Cognitive skills were assessed using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) in the late 20 s.The EpiAGE in adolescence, the early 20 s, and the late 20 s were positively correlated (r= 0.34-0.47), suggesting that EpiAGE is a relatively stable characteristic of an individual. Further, a faster pace of aging between the measurements was positively correlated with EpiAGE at the end of the period (r= 0.48-0.77) but negatively correlated with EpiAGE at the earlier time point (r= -0.42 to -0.55), suggesting a compensatory mechanism where late matures might be catching up with the early matures. Finally, higher positive EpiAGE showed small (AdjR2= 0.03) but significant relationships with a higher positive brain age gap in all participants and lower full-scale IQ in young adult women in the late 20 s.We conclude that the EpiAGE is a relatively stable characteristic of an individual across adolescence and early adulthood, but that it shows only a small relationship with accelerated brain aging and a women-specific relationship with worse performance IQ.Copyright © 2023 Mareckova, Pacinkova, Marecek, Sebejova, Izakovicova Holla, Klanova, Brazdil and Nikolova."

We aimed to replicate and expand findings from existing work by examining relationships of self-reported stress with nine epigenetic clocks: Hannum, Horvath, Intrinsic, Extrinsic, SkinBloodClock, PhenoAge, GrimAge, DNAm Telomere Length, and Pace of Aging. We analyzed data from 607 male participants (mean age 73.2 years) of the VA Normative Aging Study with one to two study visits from 1999 to 2007 (observations = 956). Stress was assessed via the 14-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Epigenetic age was calculated from DNA methylation measured in leukocytes with the HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. In linear mixed effects models adjusted for demographic/lifestyle/health factors, a standard deviation (sd) increase in PSS was associated with Horvath (β = -0.35-years, 95%CI: -0.61, -0.09,P=0.008) and Intrinsic (β = -0.40-years, 95%CI: -0.67, -0.13,P=0.004) epigenetic age deceleration. However, in models limited to participants with the highest levels of stress (≥ 75th-percentile), Horvath (β = 2.29-years, 95%CI: 0.16, 4.41,P=0.04) and Intrinsic (β = 2.06-years, 95%CI: -0.17, 4.28,P=0.07) age acceleration associations were observed. Our results reinforce the complexity of psychological stress and epigenetic aging relationships and lay a foundation for future studies that explore longitudinal relationships with other adult stress metrics and factors that can influence stress such as resilience measures."
"37564905",NA,NA,"Epigenetic clocks are increasingly being used as a tool to assess the impact of a wide variety of phenotypes and exposures on healthy ageing, with a recent focus on social determinants of health. However, little attention has been paid to the sociodemographic characteristics of participants on whom these clocks have been based. Participant characteristics are important because sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors are known to be associated with both DNA methylation variation and healthy ageing. It is also well known that machine learning algorithms have the potential to exacerbate health inequities through the use of unrepresentative samples - prediction models may underperform in social groups that were poorly represented in the training data used to construct the model. To address this gap in the literature, we conducted a review of the sociodemographic characteristics of the participants whose data were used to construct 13 commonly used epigenetic clocks. We found that although some of the epigenetic clocks were created utilizing data provided by individuals from different ages, sexes/genders, and racialized groups, sociodemographic characteristics are generally poorly reported. Reported information is limited by inadequate conceptualization of the social dimensions and exposure implications of gender and racialized inequality, and socioeconomic data are infrequently reported.

Here, we demonstrate the development of universal pan-mammalian clocks, using 11,754 methylation arrays from our Mammalian Methylation Consortium, which encompass 59 tissue types across 185 mammalian species. These predictive models estimate mammalian tissue age with high accuracy (r > 0.96). Age deviations correlate with human mortality risk, mouse somatotropic axis mutations and caloric restriction. We identified specific cytosines with methylation levels that change with age across numerous species. These sites, highly enriched in polycomb repressive complex 2-binding locations, are near genes implicated in mammalian development, cancer, obesity and longevity. Our findings offer new evidence suggesting that aging is evolutionarily conserved and intertwined with developmental processes across all mammals.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37541839","Evaluation of Cell-Specific Epigenetic Age Acceleration in People With Multiple Sclerosis.","Neurology","In multiple sclerosis (MS), accelerated aging of the immune system (immunosenescence) may be associated with disease onset or drive progression. DNA methylation (DNAm) is an epigenetic factor that varies among lymphocyte subtypes, and cell-specific DNAm is associated with MS. DNAm varies across the life span and can be used to accurately estimate biological age acceleration, which has been linked to a range of morbidities. The objective of this study was to test for cell-specific epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) in people with MS.This was a case-control study of EAA using existing DNAm data from several independent previously published studies. Data were included if .idat files from Illumina 450K or EPIC arrays were available for both a case with MS and an age-matched and sex-matched control, from the same study. Multifactor statistical modeling was performed to assess the primary outcome of EAA. We explored the relationship of EAA and MS, including interaction terms to identify immune cell-specific effects. Cell-sorted DNA methylation data from 3 independent datasets were used to validate findings.We used whole blood DNA methylation data from 583 cases with MS and 643 non-MS controls to calculate EAA using the GrimAge algorithm. The MS group exhibited an increased EAA compared with controls (approximately 9 mths, 95% CI 3.6-14.4),p= 0.001). Statistical deconvolution showed that EAA is associated with MS in a B cell-dependent manner (βint= 1.7, 95% CI 0.3-2.8),p= 0.002), irrespective of B-cell proportions. Validation analysis using 3 independent datasets enriched for B cells showed an EAA increase of 5.1 years in cases with MS compared with that in controls (95% CI 2.8-7.4,p= 5.5 × 10-5). By comparison, there was no EAA difference in MS in a T cell-enriched dataset. We found that EAA was attributed to the DNAm surrogates for Beta-2-microglobulin (difference = 47,546, 95% CI 10,067-85,026;p= 7.2 × 10-5), and smoking pack-years (difference = 8.1, 95% CI 1.9-14.2,p= 0.002).This study provides compelling evidence that B cells exhibit marked EAA in MS and supports the hypothesis that premature B-cell immune senescence plays a role in MS. Future MS studies should focus on age-related molecular mechanisms in B cells.© 2023 American Academy of Neurology."

Like other age-related diseases, residents of high-deprivation neighborhoods experience worse KOA pain outcomes compared to their more affluent neighbors. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between neighborhood deprivation and pain severity in KOA and the influence of epigenetic age acceleration (EpAA) on that relationship. The sample of 128 participants was mostly female (60.9%), approximately half non-Hispanic Black (49.2%), and had a mean age of 58 years. Spearman bivariate correlations revealed that pain severity positively correlated with EpAA (ρ = 0.47, p ≤ 0.001) and neighborhood deprivation (ρ = 0.25, p = 0.004). We found a positive significant relationship between neighborhood deprivation and EpAA (ρ = 0.47, p ≤ 0.001). Results indicate a mediating relationship between neighborhood deprivation (predictor), EpAA (mediator), and pain severity (outcome variable). There was a significant indirect effect of neighborhood deprivation on pain severity through EpAA, as the mediator accounted for a moderate portion of the total effect, PM = 0.44. Epigenetic age acceleration may act as a mechanism through which neighborhood deprivation leads to worse KOA pain outcomes and may play a role in the well-documented relationship between the neighborhood of residence and age-related diseases.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

"37467337","More than bad luck: Cancer and aging are linked to replication-driven changes to the epigenome.","Sci Adv","Aging is a leading risk factor for cancer. While it is proposed that age-related accumulation of somatic mutations drives this relationship, it is likely not the full story. We show that aging and cancer share a common epigenetic replication signature, which we modeled using DNA methylation from extensively passaged immortalized human cells in vitro and tested on clinical tissues. This signature, termed CellDRIFT, increased with age across multiple tissues, distinguished tumor from normal tissue, was escalated in normal breast tissue from cancer patients, and was transiently reset upon reprogramming. In addition, within-person tissue differences were correlated with predicted lifetime tissue-specific stem cell divisions and tissue-specific cancer risk. Our findings suggest that age-related replication may drive epigenetic changes in cells and could push them toward a more tumorigenic state."
"37644009","Epigenetic regulation in major depression and other stress-related disorders: molecular mechanisms, clinical relevance and therapeutic potential.","Signal Transduct Target Ther","Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a chronic, generally episodic and debilitating disease that affects an estimated 300 million people worldwide, but its pathogenesis is poorly understood. The heritability estimate of MDD is 30-40%, suggesting that genetics alone do not account for most of the risk of major depression. Another factor known to associate with MDD involves environmental stressors such as childhood adversity and recent life stress. Recent studies have emerged to show that the biological impact of environmental factors in MDD and other stress-related disorders is mediated by a variety of epigenetic modifications. These epigenetic modification alterations contribute to abnormal neuroendocrine responses, neuroplasticity impairment, neurotransmission and neuroglia dysfunction, which are involved in the pathophysiology of MDD. Furthermore, epigenetic marks have been associated with the diagnosis and treatment of MDD. The evaluation of epigenetic modifications holds promise for further understanding of the heterogeneous etiology and complex phenotypes of MDD, and may identify new therapeutic targets. Here, we review preclinical and clinical epigenetic findings, including DNA methylation, histone modification, noncoding RNA, RNA modification, and chromatin remodeling factor in MDD. In addition, we elaborate on the contribution of these epigenetic mechanisms to the pathological trait variability in depression and discuss how such mechanisms can be exploited for therapeutic purposes.© 2023.

Its roots produce a group of diterpenoid lipophilic bioactive components, termed tanshinones. Biosynthesis and regulation of tanshinones has attracted widespread interest. However, the methylome ofS. miltiorrhizahas not been analysed and the regulatory mechanism of DNA methylation in tanshinone production is largely unknown. Here we report single-base resolution DNA methylomes from roots and leaves. Comparative analysis revealed differential methylation patterns for CG, CHG, and CHH contexts and the association between DNA methylation and the expression of genes and small RNAs. Lowly methylated genes always had higher expression levels and 24-nucleotide sRNAs could be key players in the RdDM pathway inS. miltiorrhiza. DNA methylation variation analysis showed that CHH methylation contributed mostly to the difference. Go enrichment analysis showed that diterpenoid biosynthetic process was significantly enriched for genes with downstream overlapping with hypoCHHDMR in July_root when comparing with those in March_root. Tanshinone biosynthesis-related enzyme genes, such asDXS2,CMK,IDI1,HMGR2,DXR,MDS,CYP76AH1, 2OGD25, andCYP71D373,were less CHH methylated in gene promoters or downstream regions in roots collected in July than those collected in March. Consistently, gene expression was up-regulated inS. miltiorrhizaroots collected in July compared with March and the treatment of DNA methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine significantly promoted tanshinone production. It suggests that DNA methylation plays a significant regulatory role in tanshinone biosynthesis inS. miltiorrhizathrough changing the levels of CHH methylation in promoters or downstreams of key enzyme genes.© The Author(s) 2023.

"37575935","Transcriptomic analysis in tomato fruit reveals divergences in genes involved in cold stress response and fruit ripening.","Front Plant Sci","Cold storage is widely used to extend the postharvest life of most horticultural crops, including tomatoes, but this practice triggers cold stress and leads to the development of undesirable chilling injury (CI) symptoms. The underlying mechanisms of cold stress response and CI development in fruits remain unclear as they are often intermingled with fruit ripening changes. To gain insight into cold responses in fruits, we examined the effect of the potent ethylene signaling inhibitor 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) on fruit ripening, CI occurrence and gene expression in mature green tomatoes during storage at 20°C and 5°C. 1-MCP treatments effectively inhibited ethylene production and peel color changes during storage at 20°C. Storage at 5°C also inhibited both ethylene production and peel color change; during rewarming at 20°C, 1-MCP treatments inhibited peel color change but failed to inhibit ethylene production. Furthermore, fruits stored at 5°C for 14 d developed CI symptoms (surface pitting and decay) during the rewarming period at 20°C regardless of 1-MCP treatment. Subsequent RNA-Seq analysis revealed that cold stress triggers a large-scale transcriptomic adjustment, as noticeably more genes were differentially expressed at 5°C (8,406) than at 20°C (4,814). More importantly, we have found some important divergences among genes involved in fruit ripening (up- or down-regulated at 20°C; inhibited by 1-MCP treatment) and those involved in cold stress (up- or down-regulated at 5°C; unaffected by 1-MCP treatment). Transcriptomic adjustments unique to cold stress response were associated with ribosome biogenesis, NcRNA metabolism, DNA methylation, chromatin formation/remodeling, and alternative splicing events. These data should foster further research into cold stress response mechanisms in fruits with the ultimate aim of improving tolerance to low temperature and reduction of CI symptoms during cold storage.Copyright © 2023 Mitalo, Kang, Tran, Kubo, Ariizumi and Ezura."
"37560014","DNA methylation mediated by RdDM pathway and demethylation affects furanone accumulation through regulation of QUINONE OXIDOREDUCTASE in strawberry.","Hortic Res","Recently, increasing evidence suggests that DNA methylation plays a crucial role in fruit ripening. However, the role of DNA methylation in regulating specific traits, such as flavor, remains unclear. Here, we report a role of DNA methylation in affecting furanone biosynthesis in strawberry. Strawberry quinone oxidoreductase (FaQR) is a key enzyme in furanone biosynthesis. There are fourFaQRhomologs in strawberry cultivar 'Yuexin', and one of them,FaQR3, contributes ~50% ofFaQRtranscripts, indicating a major role ofFaQR3in furanone biosynthesis. Through characterization of levels of DNA methylation andFaQR3transcript and furanone contents during fruit ripening and after the application of DNA methylation inhibitor, we found that the DNA methylation level of theFaQR3promoter was negatively correlated withFaQR3expression and furanone accumulation, suggesting that DNA methylation may be involved in furanone biosynthesis through adjustingFaQR3expression, and responded to different temperatures consistently. In addition, transient expression of a gene in the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway,FaAGO4, and enrichment analysis of the 24-nucleotide siRNAs suggested that DNA methylation in theFaQR3promoter is mediated by the RdDM pathway. Transient RNA interference (RNAi) ofFaDMLindicated that the demethylation pathway may be involved in regulating furanone accumulation. These findings provide new insights into the role of DNA methylation and demethylation in affecting flavor quality in strawberry during fruit ripening.© The Author(s) 2023.

"37560013","5mC DNA methylation modification-mediated regulation in tissue functional differentiation and important flavor substance synthesis of tea plant (Camellia sinensis L.).","Hortic Res","In plants, 5mC DNA methylation is an important and conserved epistatic mark involving genomic stability, gene transcriptional regulation, developmental regulation, abiotic stress response, metabolite synthesis, etc. However, the roles of 5mC DNA methylation modification (5mC methylation) in tea plant growth and development (in pre-harvest processing) and flavor substance synthesis in pre- and post-harvest processing are unknown. We therefore conducted a comprehensive methylation analysis of four key pre-harvest tissues (root, leaf, flower, and fruit) and two processed leaves during oolong tea post-harvest processing. We found that differential 5mC methylation among four key tissues is closely related to tissue functional differentiation and that genes expressed tissue-specifically, responsible for tissue-specific functions, maintain relatively low 5mC methylation levels relative to non-tissue-specifically expressed genes. Importantly, hypomethylation modifications ofCsAlaDCandTS/GSgenes in roots provided the molecular basis for the dominant synthesis of theanine in roots. In addition, integration of 5mC DNA methylationomics, metabolomics, and transcriptomics of post-harvest leaves revealed that content changes in flavor metabolites during oolong tea processing were closely associated with transcription level changes in corresponding metabolite synthesis genes, and changes in transcript levels of these important synthesis genes were strictly regulated by 5mC methylation. We further report that some key genes during processing are regulated by 5mC methylation, which can effectively explain the content changes of important aroma metabolites, including α-farnesene, nerolidol, lipids, and taste substances such as catechins. Our results not only highlight the key roles of 5mC methylation in important flavor substance synthesis in pre- and post-harvest processing, but also provide epimutation-related gene targets for future improvement of tea quality or breeding of whole-tissue high-theanine varieties.© The Author(s) 2023.

They can thus affect phenotype formation in medicinal plants. However, a comprehensive review of the literature summarizing current research trends in this field is lacking. Thus, this review aims to provide an up-to-date summary of current methods for the detection of 5-mC DNA methylation, identification and analysis of DNA methyltransferases and demethyltransferases, and regulation of DNA methylation in medicinal plants. The data showed that polyploidy and environmental changes can affect DNA methylation levels in medicinal plants. Changes in DNA methylation can thus regulate plant morphogenesis, growth and development, and formation of secondary metabolites.

Neutrophils to lymphocytes-ratio (NL-ratio) was proposed as an effective and low-cost marker to monitor and predict the evolution of several clinical conditions. The main objective of the study is to analyze its temporal trend variation, over twenty years' follow-up, according to age, sex, and main clinical diagnosis, in a large representative Italian population.The InCHIANTI study enrolled representative samples from the registry list of two towns in Tuscany, Italy. Baseline data were collected in 1998, and last follow-up visits were made in 2015-18. 1343 out of the 1453 participants enrolled were included, and consented to donate a blood sample. All subjects were assessed and followed for life-style, clinical condition, physical performance, and underwent an instrumental diagnostic session.The NL-ratio showed a statistically significant interaction between birth-cohort and time of the study (p-value = 0.005). A gender dimorphism was recognized in the neutrophils absolute count and in the NL-ratio. Moreover, in female participants only, those who reported CHF had lower neutrophil-count and NL-ratio; whereas an increase in creatinine clearance was directly associated with NL-ratio. In male subjects, an increase of BMI was inversely associated with both NL-ratio and neutrophils-count during the follow-up; a similar association but in the opposite direction was observed in female participants.NL-ratio is a more reliable predictor of healthy aging than absolute lymphocytes and/or neutrophils counts. It is associated with the changes induced by disease, lifestyle, and environmental challenges in the immune system. NL-ratio confirms the gender dimorphism in the occurrence of inflammation-driven diseases, thus providing additional evidence for the necessity of tailored sex-specific measures to prevent and treat such diseases.© 2023.

Understanding and characterizing the tumor immune microenvironment enables better classification of these tumors and may reveal biomarkers that predict immunotherapeutic efficacy. In this paper, we applied a cell-type deconvolution algorithm using DNA methylation array data to investigate the composition of the tumor microenvironment in HCC. Using two publicly available datasets with a total cohort size of 57 patients, each with tumor and matched normal tissue samples, we identified key differences in immune cell composition. We found that NK cell abundance was significantly decreased in HCC tumors compared to adjacent normal tissue. We also applied DNA methylation ""clocks"" which estimate phenotypic aging and compared these findings to expression-based determinations of cellular senescence. Senescence and epigenetic aging was significantly increased in HCC tumors, and the degree of age acceleration and senescence was strongly associated with decreased NK cell abundance. In summary, we found that NK cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment is significantly diminished, and that this loss of NK abundance is strongly associated with increased senescence and age-related phenotype. These findings point to key interactions between NK cells and the senescent tumor microenvironment and offer insights into the pathogenesis of HCC as well as potential biomarkers of therapeutic efficacy."
"37660134","Epigenetic inheritance is unfaithful at intermediately methylated CpG sites.","Nat Commun","DNA methylation at the CpG dinucleotide is considered a stable epigenetic mark due to its presumed long-term inheritance through clonal expansion. Here, we perform high-throughput bisulfite sequencing on clonally derived somatic cell lines to quantitatively measure methylation inheritance at the nucleotide level. We find that although DNA methylation is generally faithfully maintained at hypo- and hypermethylated sites, this is not the case at intermediately methylated CpGs. Low fidelity intermediate methylation is interspersed throughout the genome and within genes with no or low transcriptional activity, and is not coordinately maintained between neighbouring sites. We determine that the probabilistic changes that occur at intermediately methylated sites are likely due to DNMT1 rather than DNMT3A/3B activity. The observed lack of clonal inheritance at intermediately methylated sites challenges the current epigenetic inheritance model and has direct implications for both the functional relevance and general interpretability of DNA methylation as a stable epigenetic mark.© 2023.

The purpose of this research was to assess the association between urinary cadmium (U-Cd) and whole-body aging (phenotypic age).Phenotypic age was calculated from chronological age and 9 molecular biomarkers. Multivariate linear regression models, subgroup analysis, and smoothing curve fitting were used to explore the linear and nonlinear relationship between U-Cd and phenotypic age. Mediation analysis was performed to explore the mediating effect of U-Cd on the association between smoking and phenotypic age.This study included 10,083 participants with a mean chronological age and a mean phenotypic age of 42.24 years and 42.34 years, respectively. In the fully adjusted model, there was a positive relationship between U-Cd and phenotypic age [2.13 years per 1 ng/g U-Cd, (1.67, 2.58)]. This association differed by sex, age, and smoking subgroups (P for interaction < 0.05).

"37646001","Conditional independence as a statistical assessment of evidence integration processes.","bioRxiv","Intuitively, combining multiple sources of evidence should lead to more accurate decisions than considering single sources of evidence individually. In practice, however, the proper computation may be difficult, or may require additional data that are inaccessible. Here, based on the concept of conditional independence, we consider expressions that can serve either as recipes for integrating evidence based on limited data, or as statistical benchmarks for characterizing evidence integration processes. Consider three events,A, B, andC. IfAandBare conditionally independent with respect toC, then the probability thatCoccurs given that bothAandBare known,P(C|A, B), can be easily calculated without the need to measure the full three-way dependency betweenA, B, andC. This simplified approach can be used in two general ways: to generate predictions by combining multiple (conditionally independent) sources of evidence, or to test whether separate sources of evidence are functionally independent of each other. These applications are demonstrated with four computer-simulated examples, which include detecting a disease based on repeated diagnostic testing, inferring biological age based on multiple biomarkers of aging, discriminating two spatial locations based on multiple cue stimuli (multisensory integration), and examining how behavioral performance in a visual search task depends on selection histories. Besides providing a sound prescription for estimating outcomes, this methodology may be useful for analyzing experimental data of many types."
"37635161","Biological age is superior to chronological age in predicting hospital mortality of the critically ill.","Intern Emerg Med","Biological age is increasingly recognized as being more accurate than chronological age in determining chronic health outcomes. This study assessed whether biological age, assessed on intensive care unit (ICU) admission, can predict hospital mortality. This retrospective cohort study, conducted in a tertiary multidisciplinary ICU in Western Australia, used the Levine PhenoAge model to estimate each patient's biological age (also called PhenoAge). Each patient's PhenoAge was calibrated to generate a regression residual which was equivalent to biological age unexplained by chronological age in the local context. PhenoAgeAccel was a dichotomized measure of the residuals, and its presence suggested that one was biologically older than the corresponding chronological age. Of the 2950 critically ill adult patients analyzed, 291 died (9.9%) before hospital discharge. Both PhenoAge and its residuals (after regressing on chronological age) had a significantly better ability to differentiate between hospital survivors and non-survivors than chronological age (area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve 0.648 and 0.654 vs. 0.547 respectively). Being phenotypically older than one's chronological age was associated with an increased risk of mortality (PhenoAgeAccel hazard ratio [HR] 1.997, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.568-2.542; p = 0.001) in a dose-related fashion and did not reach a plateau until at least a 20-year gap. This adverse association remained significant (adjusted HR 1.386, 95% CI 1.077-1.784; p = 0.011) after adjusted for severity of acute illness and comorbidities. PhenoAgeAccel was more prevalent among those with pre-existing chronic cardiovascular disease, end-stage renal failure, cirrhosis, immune disease, diabetes mellitus, or those treated with immunosuppressive therapy. Being phenotypically older than one's chronological age was more common among those with comorbidities, and this was associated with an increased risk of mortality in a dose-related fashion in the critically ill that was not fully explained by comorbidities and severity of acute illness.© 2023.

We examined the association between contemporary redlining, a measure of structural racism at the neighborhood level, and DNA methylation in breast tumor tissue.We identified 80 Black and White women diagnosed and treated for a first-primary breast cancer at Emory University Hospitals (2008-2017). Contemporary redlining was derived for census tracts using the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act database. Linear regression models were used to calculate the association between contemporary redlining and methylation in breast tumor tissue. We also examined epigenetic age acceleration for two different metrics, regressing β values for each cytosine-phosphate-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) site on redlining while adjusting for covariates. We employed multivariable Cox-proportional hazards models and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to estimate the association between aberrant methylation and mortality.Contemporary redlining was associated with 5 CpG sites after adjustment for multiple comparisons (FDR<0.10). All genes were implicated in breast carcinogenesis, including genes related to inflammation, immune function and stress response (ANGPT1, PRG4 and PRG4). Further exploration of the top 25 CpG sites, identified interaction of 2 sites (MRPS28and cg11092048) by ER status and 1 site (GDP1) was associated with all-cause mortality. Contemporary redlining was associated with epigenetic age acceleration by the Hannum metric (β=5.35; CI 95%=0.30,10.4) and showed positive but non-significant correlation with the other clock.We identified novel associations between neighborhood contemporary redlining and the breast tumor DNA methylome, suggesting that racist policies leading to inequitable social and environmental exposures, may impact the breast tumor epigenome.

"37621446",NA,NA,"Estimating an individual's age can be relevant in several areas primarily related to the clinical and forensic fields. In the latter, estimation of an individual's chronological age from biological material left by the perpetrator at a crime scene may provide helpful information for police investigation. Estimation of age is also beneficial in immigration cases, where age can affect the person's protection status under the law, or in disaster victim identification to narrow the list of potential missing persons. In the last decade, research has focused on establishing new approaches for age prediction in the forensic field. From the first forensic age estimations based on morphological inspections of macroscopic changes in bone and teeth, the focus has shifted to molecular methods for age estimation. These methods allow the use of samples from human biological material that does not contain morphological age features and can, in theory, be investigated in traces containing only small amounts of biological material. Molecular methods involving DNA analyses are the primary choice and estimation of DNA methylation levels at specific sites in the genome is the most promising tool. This review aims to provide an overview of the status of forensic age prediction using molecular methods, with particular focus in DNA methylation.

"37576279",NA,NA,"Longevity has been a topic of interest since the beginnings of humanity, yet its aetiology and precise mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Aging is currently viewed as a physiological phenomenon characterized by the gradual degeneration of organic physiology and morphology due to the passage of time where both external and internal stimuli intervene. The influence of intrinsic factors, such as progressive telomere shortening, genome instability due to mutation buildup, the direct or indirect actions of age-related genes, and marked changes in epigenetic, metabolic, and mitochondrial patterns constitute a big part of its underlying endogenous mechanisms. On the other hand, several psychosocial and demographic factors, such as diet, physical activity, smoking, and drinking habits, may have an even more significant impact on shaping the aging process. Consequentially, implementing dietary and exercise patterns has been proposed as the most viable alternative strategy for attenuating the most typical degenerative aging changes, thus increasing the likelihood of prolonging lifespan and achieving successful aging.© 2023 The Authors."
"37640881","Extremely sparse models of linkage disequilibrium in ancestrally diverse association studies.","Nat Genet","Linkage disequilibrium (LD) is the correlation among nearby genetic variants. In genetic association studies, LD is often modeled using large correlation matrices, but this approach is inefficient, especially in ancestrally diverse studies. In the present study, we introduce LD graphical models (LDGMs), which are an extremely sparse and efficient representation of LD. LDGMs are derived from genome-wide genealogies; statistical relationships among alleles in the LDGM correspond to genealogical relationships among haplotypes. We published LDGMs and ancestry-specific LDGM precision matrices for 18 million common variants (minor allele frequency >1%) in five ancestry groups, validated their accuracy and demonstrated order-of-magnitude improvements in runtime for commonly used LD matrix computations. We implemented an extremely fast multiancestry polygenic prediction method, BLUPx-ldgm, which performs better than a similar method based on the reference LD correlation matrix. LDGMs will enable sophisticated methods that scale to ancestrally diverse genetic association data across millions of variants and individuals.© 2023.

Traditional PGSs assume genotype data to be error-free, ignoring possible errors and uncertainties introduced from genotyping, sequencing, and/or imputation. In this work, we investigate the effects of genotyping error due to low coverage sequencing on PGS estimation. We leverage SNP array and low-coverage whole-genome sequencing data (lcWGS, median coverage 0.04×) of 802 individuals from the Dana-Farber PROFILE cohort to show that PGS error correlates with sequencing depth (p = 1.2 × 10-7). We develop a probabilistic approach that incorporates genotype error in PGS estimation to produce well-calibrated PGS credible intervals and show that the probabilistic approach increases classification accuracy by up to 6% as compared to traditional PGSs that ignore genotyping error. Finally, we use simulations to explore the combined effect of genotyping and effect size errors and their implication on PGS-based risk-stratification.

Here, we report on the use of mass cytometry (MC) to analyze multiple model systems and demonstrate MC as a platform for senescence analysis at the single-cell level. We demonstrate changes to p16 expression, cell cycling fraction, and histone tail modifications in several established senescent model systems and using isolated human T cells. In bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs), we show increased p16 expression with subsequent passage as well as a reduction in cycling cells and open chromatin marks. In WI-38 cells, we demonstrate increased p16 expression with both culture-induced senescence and oxidative stress-induced senescence (OSIS). We also use Wanderlust, a trajectory analysis tool, to demonstrate how p16 expression changes with histone tail modifications and cell cycle proteins. Finally, we demonstrate that repetitive stimulation of human T cells with CD3/CD28 beads induces an exhausted phenotype with increased p16 expression. This p16-expressing population exhibited higher expression of exhaustion markers such as EOMES and TOX. This work demonstrates that MC is a useful platform for studying senescence at a single-cell protein level, and is capable of measuring multiple markers of senescence at once with high confidence, thereby improving our understanding of senescent pathways."

However, biomarkers towards pathogenesis or novel targets are still limited.To identify the causality between plasma proteins and the risk of AD and other eight common neurological diseases using a Mendelian randomization (MR) study.Exposure data were obtained from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 2,994 plasma proteins in 3,301 healthy adults, and outcome datasets included GWAS summary statistics of nine neurological disorders. Inverse variance-weighted MR method as the primary analysis was used to estimate causal effects.Higher genetically proxied plasma myeloid cell surface antigen CD33 level was found to be associated with increased risk of AD (odds ratio [OR] 1.079, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.047-1.112,p = 8.39×10-7). We also discovered the causality between genetically proxied elevated prolactin and higher risk of epilepsy (OR = 1.068, 95% CI = 1.034-1.102;p = 5.46×10-5). Negative associations were identified between cyclin-dependent kinase 8 and ischemic stroke (OR = 0.927, 95% CI = 0.896-0.959,p = 9.32×10-6), between neuralized E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase 1 and migraine (OR = 0.914, 95% CI = 0.878-0.952,p = 1.48×10-5), and between Fc receptor-like protein 4 and multiple sclerosis (MS) (OR = 0.929, 95% CI = 0.897-0.963,p = 4.27×10-5).The findings identified MR-level protein-disease associations for AD, epilepsy, ischemic stroke, migraine, and MS.© 2023 – The authors.

"37588130","Integrative Post-Genome-Wide Association Study Analyses Relevant to Psychiatric Disorders: Imputing Transcriptome and Proteome Signals.","Complex Psychiatry","The genome-wide association study (GWAS) is a common tool to identify genetic variants associated with complex traits, including psychiatric disorders (PDs). However, post-GWAS analyses are needed to extend the statistical inference to biologically relevant entities, e.g., genes, proteins, and pathways. To achieve this goal, researchers developed methods that incorporate biologically relevant intermediate molecular phenotypes, such as gene expression and protein abundance, which are posited to mediate the variant-trait association. Transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) and proteome-wide association study (PWAS) are commonly used methods to test the association between these molecular mediators and the trait.In this review, we discuss the most recent developments in TWAS and PWAS. These methods integrate existing ""omic"" information with the GWAS summary statistics for trait(s) of interest. Specifically, they impute transcript/protein data and test the association between imputed gene expression/protein level with phenotype of interest by using (i) GWAS summary statistics and (ii) reference transcriptomic/proteomic/genomic datasets. TWAS and PWAS are suitable as analysis tools for (i) primary association scan and (ii) fine-mapping to identify potentially causal genes for PDs.As post-GWAS analyses, TWAS and PWAS have the potential to highlight causal genes for PDs. These prioritized genes could indicate targets for the development of novel drug therapies. For researchers attempting such analyses, we recommend Mendelian randomization tools that use GWAS statistics for both trait and reference datasets, e.g., summary Mendelian randomization (SMR). We base our recommendation on (i) being able to use the same tool for both TWAS and PWAS, (ii) not requiring the pre-computed weights (and thus easier to update for larger reference datasets), and (iii) most larger transcriptome reference datasets are publicly available and easy to transform into a compatible format for SMR analysis.© 2023 S.

We identified 180 pQTLs (59 cis, 121 trans). Integration of pQTL data with eQTL and disease genome-wide association studies provided insight into pathogenesis, implicating lymphotoxin-α in multiple sclerosis. Using Mendelian randomization (MR) to assess causality in disease etiology, we identified both shared and distinct effects of specific proteins across immune-mediated diseases, including directionally discordant effects of CD40 on risk of rheumatoid arthritis versus multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowel disease.

"37558884","Converging evidence from exome sequencing and common variants implicates target genes for osteoporosis.","Nat Genet","In this study, we leveraged the combined evidence of rare coding variants and common alleles to identify therapeutic targets for osteoporosis. We undertook a large-scale multiancestry exome-wide association study for estimated bone mineral density, which showed that the burden of rare coding alleles in 19 genes was associated with estimated bone mineral density (P < 3.6 × 10-7). These genes were highly enriched for a set of known causal genes for osteoporosis (65-fold; P = 2.5 × 10-5). Exome-wide significant genes had 96-fold increased odds of being the top ranked effector gene at a given GWAS locus (P = 1.8 × 10-10). By integrating proteomics Mendelian randomization evidence, we prioritized CD109 (cluster of differentiation 109) as a gene for which heterozygous loss of function is associated with higher bone density. CRISPR-Cas9 editing of CD109 in SaOS-2 osteoblast-like cell lines showed that partial CD109 knockdown led to increased mineralization. This study demonstrates that the convergence of common and rare variants, proteomics and CRISPR can highlight new bone biology to guide therapeutic development.© 2023.

Evidence suggests that early-life adversity can become biologically embedded and has the potential to influence health outcomes decades later. Epigenetics is one mechanism that has been implicated in these long-lasting effects. Observational studies in humans indicate that the effects of stress could even persist across generations, although whether or not epigenetic mechanisms are involved remains under debate. Here, we provide an overview of studies in animals and humans that demonstrate the effects of early-life stress on DNA methylation, one of the most widely studied epigenetic mechanisms, and summarize findings from animal models demonstrating the involvement of epigenetics in the transmission of stress across generations. We then describe the results of a scoping review to determine the extent to which the terms intergenerational or transgenerational have been used in human studies investigating the transmission of trauma and stress via epigenetic mechanisms. We end with a discussion of key areas for future research to advance understanding of the role of epigenetics in the legacy effects of stress and trauma."

Their unique molecular mechanisms underlying imprinted genes offer an opportunity to investigate epigenetic-based therapy for reactivation of an inactive allele or reduction of an active allele. Current treatments are based on managing symptoms, not targeting the molecular mechanisms underlying imprinting disorders. Here, we highlight molecular approaches of therapeutic candidates in preclinical and clinical studies for individual imprinting disorders. These include the significant progress of discovery and testing of small molecules, antisense oligonucleotides, and CRISPR mediated genome editing approaches as new therapeutic strategies.

"37612734",NA,NA,"Promoter hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes is frequently observed during the malignant transformation of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, whether this epigenetic mechanism is functional in cancer or is a mere consequence of the carcinogenic process remains to be elucidated.In this work, we performed an integrative multi-omic approach to identify gene candidates with strong correlations between DNA methylation and gene expression in human CRC samples and a set of 8 colon cancer cell lines. As a proof of concept, we combined recent CRISPR-Cas9 epigenome editing tools (dCas9-TET1, dCas9-TET-IM) with a customized arrayed gRNA library to modulate the DNA methylation status of 56 promoters previously linked with strong epigenetic repression in CRC, and we monitored the potential functional consequences of this DNA methylation loss by means of a high-content cell proliferation screen. Overall, the epigenetic modulation of most of these DNA methylated regions had a mild impact on the reactivation of gene expression and on the viability of cancer cells. Interestingly, we found that epigenetic reactivation of RSPO2 in the tumour context was associated with a significant impairment in cell proliferation in p53-/-cancer cell lines, and further validation with human samples demonstrated that the epigenetic silencing of RSPO2 is a mid-late event in the adenoma to carcinoma sequence.These results highlight the potential role of DNA methylation as a driver mechanism of CRC and paves the way for the identification of novel therapeutic windows based on the epigenetic reactivation of certain tumour suppressor genes.© 2023.

"37563110","TET (Ten-eleven translocation) family proteins: structure, biological functions and applications.","Signal Transduct Target Ther","Ten-eleven translocation (TET) family proteins (TETs), specifically, TET1, TET2 and TET3, can modify DNA by oxidizing 5-methylcytosine (5mC) iteratively to yield 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC), and 5-carboxycytosine (5caC), and then two of these intermediates (5fC and 5caC) can be excised and return to unmethylated cytosines by thymine-DNA glycosylase (TDG)-mediated base excision repair. Because DNA methylation and demethylation play an important role in numerous biological processes, including zygote formation, embryogenesis, spatial learning and immune homeostasis, the regulation of TETs functions is complicated, and dysregulation of their functions is implicated in many diseases such as myeloid malignancies. In addition, recent studies have demonstrated that TET2 is able to catalyze the hydroxymethylation of RNA to perform post-transcriptional regulation. Notably, catalytic-independent functions of TETs in certain biological contexts have been identified, further highlighting their multifunctional roles. Interestingly, by reactivating the expression of selected target genes, accumulated evidences support the potential therapeutic use of TETs-based DNA methylation editing tools in disorders associated with epigenetic silencing. In this review, we summarize recent key findings in TETs functions, activity regulators at various levels, technological advances in the detection of 5hmC, the main TETs oxidative product, and TETs emerging applications in epigenetic editing. Furthermore, we discuss existing challenges and future directions in this field.© 2023. West China Hospital, Sichuan University."

To reliably and efficiently link detected compounds to exposures and health phenotypes in such studies, it is important to understand the variability in metabolome measures. We assessed the within- and between-subject variability of untargeted LC-HRMS measurements in 298 nonfasting human serum samples collected on two occasions from 157 subjects. Samples were collected ca. 107 (IQR: 34) days apart as part of the multicenter EXPOsOMICS Personal Exposure Monitoring study. In total, 4294 metabolic features were detected, and 184 unique compounds could be identified with high confidence. The median intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) across all metabolic features was 0.51 (IQR: 0.29) and 0.64 (IQR: 0.25) for the 184 uniquely identified compounds. For this group, the median ICC marginally changed (0.63) when we included common confounders (age, sex, and body mass index) in the regression model. When grouping compounds by compound class, the ICC was largest among glycerophospholipids (median ICC 0.70) and steroids (0.67), and lowest for amino acids (0.61) and the O-acylcarnitine class (0.44). ICCs varied substantially within chemical classes. Our results suggest that the metabolome as measured with untargeted LC-HRMS is fairly stable (ICC > 0.5) over 100 days for more than half of the features monitored in our study, to reflect average levels across this time period. Variance across the metabolome will result in differential measurement error across the metabolome, which needs to be considered in the interpretation of metabolome results."

MDD is a complex disorder that cannot be fully explained by any one single established biological or environmental pathway. Instead, MDD seems to be caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, psychological and biological factors.

"37640912","Colocalization of expression transcripts with COVID-19 outcomes is rare across cell states, cell types and organs.","Hum Genet","Identifying causal genes at GWAS loci can help pinpoint targets for therapeutic interventions. Expression studies can disentangle such loci but signals from expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) often fail to colocalize-which means that the genetic control of measured expression is not shared with the genetic control of disease risk. This may be because gene expression is measured in the wrong cell type, physiological state, or organ. We tested whether Mendelian randomization (MR) could identify genes at loci influencing COVID-19 outcomes and whether the colocalization of genetic control of expression and COVID-19 outcomes was influenced by cell type, cell stimulation, and organ. We conducted MR of cis-eQTLs from single cell (scRNA-seq) and bulk RNA sequencing. We then tested variables that could influence colocalization, including cell type, cell stimulation, RNA sequencing modality, organ, symptoms of COVID-19, and SARS-CoV-2 status among individuals with symptoms of COVID-19. The outcomes used to test colocalization were COVID-19 severity and susceptibility as assessed in the Host Genetics Initiative release 7. Most transcripts identified using MR did not colocalize when tested across cell types, cell state and in different organs. Most that did colocalize likely represented false positives due to linkage disequilibrium. In general, colocalization was highly variable and at times inconsistent for the same transcript across cell type, cell stimulation and organ. While we identified factors that influenced colocalization for select transcripts, identifying 33 that mediate COVID-19 outcomes, our study suggests that colocalization of expression with COVID-19 outcomes is partially due to noisy signals even after following quality control and sensitivity testing. These findings illustrate the present difficulty of linking expression transcripts to disease outcomes and the need for skepticism when observing eQTL MR results, even accounting for cell types, stimulation state and different organs.© 2023.

Whole blood was used to extract genomic DNA. JAK2 DNA methylation level was assessed by MethylTargetTM. The logistic regression model was utilized to assess the association of sitting time with abdominal obesity, and the possible effect of JAK2 DNA methylation on the association were conducted by using mediation analyses.Average time of sitting of participants was 7.28 ± 3.37 h/d. For per 1 h increment in sitting time, the odd ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of abdominal obesity was 1.153 (1.095, 1.214) after controlling potential risk factors. Simultaneously, the methylation levels of Chr9: 4985407 site and Chr9: 4985238-4985455 region were negatively correlated with abdominal obesity (OR: 0.549, 95% CI: 0.394, 0.765; OR: 0.189, 95% CI: 0.056, 0.640, respectively). Moreover, Chr9: 4985407 site and Chr9: 4985238-4985455 region methylation levels mediated the association of sitting time with abdominal obesity, and the indirect effects account for 6.78% and 4.24%, respectively.Longer sitting time was positively correlated with abdominal obesity in the rural population, and methylation level of JAK2 may be an underlying mediation of the effect.© 2023.

Here we conducted a genome-wide association meta-analysis of 13 structural and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging-derived cortical phenotypes, measured globally and at 180 bilaterally averaged regions in 36,663 individuals and identified 4,349 experiment-wide significant loci. These phenotypes include cortical thickness, surface area, gray matter volume, measures of folding, neurite density and water diffusion. We identified four genetic latent structures and causal relationships between surface area and some measures of cortical folding. These latent structures partly relate to different underlying gene expression trajectories during development and are enriched for different cell types. We also identified differential enrichment for neurodevelopmental and constrained genes and demonstrate that common genetic variants associated with cortical expansion are associated with cephalic disorders. Finally, we identified complex interphenotype and inter-regional genetic relationships among the 13 phenotypes, reflecting the developmental differences among them.

We identify 26 genome-wide significant loci, 19 of which are specific to genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE). We implicate 29 likely causal genes underlying these 26 loci. SNP-based heritability analyses show that common variants explain between 39.6% and 90% of genetic risk for GGE and its subtypes. Subtype analysis revealed markedly different genetic architectures between focal and generalized epilepsies. Gene-set analyses of GGE signals implicate synaptic processes in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the brain.

We apply treeLFA to UK Biobank data and identify a variety of topics representing multimorbidity clusters, including a healthy topic. We find that loci identified using topic weights as traits in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis, which we validated with a range of approaches, only partially overlap with loci from GWASs on constituent single diseases. We also show that treeLFA improves upon existing methods like latent Dirichlet allocation in various ways.

"37587338","Nuclear genetic control of mtDNA copy number and heteroplasmy in humans.","Nature","Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is a maternally inherited, high-copy-number genome required for oxidative phosphorylation1. Heteroplasmy refers to the presence of a mixture of mtDNA alleles in an individual and has been associated with disease and ageing. Mechanisms underlying common variation in human heteroplasmy, and the influence of the nuclear genome on this variation, remain insufficiently explored. Here we quantify mtDNA copy number (mtCN) and heteroplasmy using blood-derived whole-genome sequences from 274,832 individuals and perform genome-wide association studies to identify associated nuclear loci. Following blood cell composition correction, we find that mtCN declines linearly with age and is associated with variants at 92 nuclear loci. We observe that nearly everyone harbours heteroplasmic mtDNA variants obeying two principles: (1) heteroplasmic single nucleotide variants tend to arise somatically and accumulate sharply after the age of 70 years, whereas (2) heteroplasmic indels are maternally inherited as mixtures with relative levels associated with 42 nuclear loci involved in mtDNA replication, maintenance and novel pathways. These loci may act by conferring a replicative advantage to certain mtDNA alleles. As an illustrative example, we identify a length variant carried by more than 50% of humans at position chrM:302 within a G-quadruplex previously proposed to mediate mtDNA transcription/replication switching2,3. We find that this variant exerts cis-acting genetic control over mtDNA abundance and is itself associated in-trans with nuclear loci encoding machinery for this regulatory switch. Our study suggests that common variation in the nuclear genome can shape variation in mtCN and heteroplasmy dynamics across the human population.© 2023. The Author(s)."

However, co-regulation of genetic effects on gene expression across tissues impedes distinguishing biologically causal tissues from tagging tissues. In the present study, we introduce tissue co-regulation score regression (TCSC), which disentangles causal tissues from tagging tissues by regressing gene-disease association statistics (from transcriptome-wide association studies) on tissue co-regulation scores, reflecting correlations of predicted gene expression across genes and tissues. We applied TCSC to 78 diseases/traits (average n = 302,000) and gene expression prediction models for 48 GTEx tissues. TCSC identified 21 causal tissue-trait pairs at a 5% false discovery rate (FDR), including well-established findings, biologically plausible new findings (for example, aorta artery and glaucoma) and increased specificity of known tissue-trait associations (for example, subcutaneous adipose, but not visceral adipose, and high-density lipoprotein). TCSC also identified 17 causal tissue-trait covariance pairs at 5% FDR. In conclusion, TCSC is a precise method for distinguishing causal tissues from tagging tissues.© 2023.

Human genetics studies have now associated hundreds of thousands of differences in our DNA sequence (""genomic variation"") with disease risk and other phenotypes, many of which could reveal novel mechanisms of human biology and uncover the basis of genetic predispositions to diseases, thereby guiding the development of new diagnostics and therapeutics. Yet, understanding how genomic variation alters genome function to influence phenotype has proven challenging. To unlock these insights, we need a systematic and comprehensive catalog of genome function and the molecular and cellular effects of genomic variants. Toward this goal, the Impact of Genomic Variation on Function (IGVF) Consortium will combine approaches in single-cell mapping, genomic perturbations, and predictive modeling to investigate the relationships among genomic variation, genome function, and phenotypes. Through systematic comparisons and benchmarking of experimental and computational methods, we aim to create maps across hundreds of cell types and states describing how coding variants alter protein activity, how noncoding variants change the regulation of gene expression, and how both coding and noncoding variants may connect through gene regulatory and protein interaction networks. These experimental data, computational predictions, and accompanying standards and pipelines will be integrated into an open resource that will catalyze community efforts to explore genome function and the impact of genetic variation on human biology and disease across populations."
"37546828",NA,NA,"The study aimed to discover novel genetic loci for atrial fibrillation (AF), explore the shared genetic etiologies between AF and other cardiovascular and cardiometabolic traits, and uncover AF pathogenesis using Mendelian randomization analysis.We conducted a genome-wide association study meta-analysis including 109,787 AF cases and 1,165,920 controls of European ancestry and identified 215 loci, among which 91 were novel. We performed Genomic Structural Equation Modeling analysis between AF and four cardiovascular comorbidities (coronary artery disease, ischemic stroke, heart failure, and vneous thromboembolism) and found 189 loci shared across these diseases as well as a universal genetic locus shared by atherosclerotic outcomes (i.e., rs1537373 nearCDKN2B). Three genetic loci (rs10740129 nearJMJD1C, rs2370982 nearNRXN3, and rs9931494 nearFTO) were associated with AF and cardiometabolic traits. A polygenic risk score derived from this genome-wide meta-analysis was associated with AF risk (odds ratio 2.36, 95% confidence interval 2.31-2.41 per standard deviation increase) in the UK biobank. This score, combined with age, sex, and basic clinical features, predicted AF risk (AUC 0.784, 95% CI 0.781-0.787) in Europeans. Phenome-wide association analysis of the polygenic risk score identified many AF-related comorbidities of the circulatory, endocrine, and respiratory systems. Phenome-wide and multi-omic Mendelian randomization analyses identified associations of blood lipids and pressure, diabetes, insomnia, obesity, short sleep, and smoking, 27 blood proteins, one gut microbe (genus.Catenibacterium), and 11 blood metabolites with risk to AF.This genome-wide association study and trans-omic Mendelian randomization analysis provides insights into disease risk prediction, pathophysiology and downstream sequelae."
"37523391","A statistical framework to identify cell types whose genetically regulated proportions are associated with complex diseases.","PLoS Genet","Finding disease-relevant tissues and cell types can facilitate the identification and investigation of functional genes and variants. In particular, cell type proportions can serve as potential disease predictive biomarkers. In this manuscript, we introduce a novel statistical framework, cell-type Wide Association Study (cWAS), that integrates genetic data with transcriptomics data to identify cell types whose genetically regulated proportions (GRPs) are disease/trait-associated. On simulated and real GWAS data, cWAS showed good statistical power with newly identified significant GRP associations in disease-associated tissues. More specifically, GRPs of endothelial and myofibroblasts in lung tissue were associated with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, respectively. For breast cancer, the GRP of blood CD8+ T cells was negatively associated with breast cancer (BC) risk as well as survival. Overall, cWAS is a powerful tool to reveal cell types associated with complex diseases mediated by GRPs.Copyright: © 2023 Liu et al.

"37546999","Calibrated prediction intervals for polygenic scores across diverse contexts.","medRxiv","Polygenic scores (PGS) have emerged as the tool of choice for genomic prediction in a wide range of fields from agriculture to personalized medicine. We analyze data from two large biobanks in the US (All of Us) and the UK (UK Biobank) to find widespread variability in PGS performance across contexts. Many contexts, including age, sex, and income, impact PGS accuracies with similar magnitudes as genetic ancestry. PGSs trained in single versus multi-ancestry cohorts show similar context-specificity in their accuracies. We introduce trait prediction intervals that are allowed to vary across contexts as a principled approach to account for context-specific PGS accuracy in genomic prediction. We model the impact of all contexts in a joint framework to enable PGS-based trait predictions that are well-calibrated (contain the trait value with 90% probability in all contexts), whereas methods that ignore context are mis-calibrated. We show that prediction intervals need to be adjusted for all considered traits ranging from 10% for diastolic blood pressure to 80% for waist circumference. Adjustment of prediction intervals depends on the dataset; for example, prediction intervals for education years need to be adjusted by 90% in All of Us versus 8% in UK Biobank. Our results provide a path forward towards utilization of PGS as a prediction tool across all individuals regardless of their contexts while highlighting the importance of comprehensive profile of context information in study design and data collection."

In contrast, acute ketamine quickly improves mood for an extended time. Recent work implicates that hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels are involved in mediating ketamine's antidepressant effects. In this study, we directly targeted HCN channels and achieved ketamine-like rapid and sustained antidepressant efficacy. Ourin vitroelectrophysiological recordings first showed that HCN inhibitor DK-AH 269 (also called cilobradine) decreased the pathological HCN-mediated current (Ih) and abnormal hyperactivity of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neurons in a depressive-like model produced by chronic social defeat stress (CSDS). Ourin vivostudies further showed that acute intra-VTA or acute systemic administration of DK-AH 269 normalized social behavior and rescued sucrose preference in CSDS-susceptible mice. The single-dose of DK-AH 269, both by intra-VTA microinfusion and intraperitoneal (ip) approaches, could produce an extended 13-day duration of antidepressant-like efficacy. Animals treated with acute DK-AH 269 spent less time immobile than vehicle-treated mice during forced swim test. A social behavioral reversal lasted up to 13 days following the acute DK-AH 269 ip injection, and this rapid and sustained antidepressant-like response is paralleled with a single-dose treatment of ketamine. This study provides a novel ion channel target for acutely acting, long-lasting antidepressant-like effects.© 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc."

"37626176","Central regulation of stress-evoked peripheral immune responses.","Nat Rev Neurosci","Stress-linked psychiatric disorders, including anxiety and major depressive disorder, are associated with systemic inflammation. Recent studies have reported stress-induced alterations in haematopoiesis that result in monocytosis, neutrophilia, lymphocytopenia and, consequently, in the upregulation of pro-inflammatory processes in immunologically relevant peripheral tissues. There is now evidence that this peripheral inflammation contributes to the development of psychiatric symptoms as well as to common co-morbidities of psychiatric disorders such as metabolic syndrome and immunosuppression. Here, we review the specific brain and spinal regions, and the neuronal populations within them, that respond to stress and transmit signals to peripheral tissues via the autonomic nervous system or neuroendocrine pathways to influence immunological function. We comprehensively summarize studies that have employed retrograde tracing to define neurocircuits linking the brain to the bone marrow, spleen, gut, adipose tissue and liver. Moreover, we highlight studies that have used chemogenetic or optogenetic manipulation or intracerebroventricular administration of peptide hormones to control somatic immune responses. Collectively, this growing body of literature illustrates potential mechanisms through which stress signals are conveyed from the CNS to immune cells to regulate stress-relevant behaviours and comorbid pathophysiology.© 2023.

Understanding the effect of mouse gene dysfunction on metabolism can inform the functions of their human orthologues. We investigated the effect of loss-of-function mutations in 30 unique gene knockout (KO) lines on plasma metabolites, including genes coding for structural proteins (11 of 30), metabolic pathway enzymes (12 of 30) and protein kinases (7 of 30). Steroids, bile acids, oxylipins, primary metabolites, biogenic amines and complex lipids were analyzed with dedicated mass spectrometry platforms, yielding 827 identified metabolites in male and female KO mice and wildtype (WT) controls. Twenty-two percent of 23,698 KO versus WT comparison tests showed significant genotype effects on plasma metabolites. Fifty-six percent of identified metabolites were significantly different between the sexes in WT mice. Many of these metabolites were also found to have sexually dimorphic changes in KO lines. We used plasma metabolites to complement phenotype information exemplified for Dhfr, Idh1, Mfap4, Nek2, Npc2, Phyh and Sra1. The association of plasma metabolites with IMPC phenotypes showed dramatic sexual dimorphism in wildtype mice. We demonstrate how to link metabolomics to genotypes and (disease) phenotypes. Sex must be considered as critical factor in the biological interpretation of gene functions."
"37577542","Sex-specific adaptations to VTA circuits following subchronic stress.","bioRxiv","Dysregulation of the mesolimbic reward circuitry is implicated in the pathophysiology of stress-related illnesses such as depression and anxiety. These disorders are more frequently diagnosed in females, and sex differences in the response to stress are likely to be one factor that leads to enhanced vulnerability of females. In this study, we use subchronic variable stress (SCVS), a model in which females are uniquely vulnerable to behavioral disturbances, to investigate sexually divergent mechanisms of regulation of the ventral tegmental area by stress. Using slice electrophysiology, we find that female, but not male mice have a reduction in theex vivofiring rate of VTA dopaminergic neurons following SCVS. Surprisingly, both male and female animals show an increase in inhibitory tone onto VTA dopaminergic neurons and an increase in the firing rate of VTA GABAergic neurons. In males, however, this is accompanied by a robust increase in excitatory synaptic tone onto VTA dopamine neurons. This supports a model by which SCVS recruits VTA GABA neurons to inhibit dopaminergic neurons in both male and female mice, but males are protected from diminished functioning of the dopaminergic system by a compensatory upregulation of excitatory synapses."

However, the mitochondria-behavior relationship has not been systematically studied at a brain-wide scale. Here we examined the association between multiple features of mitochondrial respiratory chain capacity and stress-related behaviors in male mice with diverse behavioral phenotypes. Miniaturized assays of mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme activities and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content were deployed on 571 samples across 17 brain areas, defining specific patterns of mito-behavior associations. By applying multi-slice network analysis to our brain-wide mitochondrial dataset, we identified three large-scale networks of brain areas with shared mitochondrial signatures. A major network composed of cortico-striatal areas exhibited the strongest mitochondria-behavior correlations, accounting for up to 50% of animal-to-animal behavioral differences, suggesting that this mito-based network is functionally significant. The mito-based brain networks also overlapped with regional gene expression and structural connectivity, and exhibited distinct molecular mitochondrial phenotype signatures. This work provides convergent multimodal evidence anchored in enzyme activities, gene expression, and animal behavior that distinct, behaviorally-relevant mitochondrial phenotypes exist across the male mouse brain.© 2023.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the long-term effects of in utero exposure to the synthetic GC analog dexamethasone (Dex) in adult female offspring. We monitored spontaneous activity in the home cage under a constant 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle, as well as the changes following a 6-h advance of dark onset (phase shift). For comparison, we re-analysed data previously recorded in males. Dex-exposed females were spontaneously more active, and the activity onset re-entrained slower than in controls. In contrast, Dex-exposed males were less active, and the activity onset re-entrained faster than in controls. Following the phase shift, control females displayed a transient reorganisation of behaviour in light and virtually no change in dark, while Dex-exposed females showed limited variations from baseline in both light and dark, suggesting weaker photic entrainment. Next, we ran bulk RNA-sequencing in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of Dex and control females. SPIA pathway analysis of ~ 2300 differentially expressed genes identified significantly downregulated dopamine signalling, and upregulated glutamate and GABA signalling. We selected a set of candidate genes matching the behaviour alterations and found consistent differential regulation for ~ 73% of tested genes in SCN and hippocampus tissue samples. Taken together, our data highlight sex differences in the outcome of prenatal exposure to excess GC in adult mice: in contrast to depression-like behaviour in males, the phenotype in females, defined by behaviour and differential gene expression, is consistent with ADHD models.© 2023.

However, preclinical models have primarily used males, such that the molecular mechanisms underlying sex-specific differences in psychiatric disorders are not well established.In this study, we compared transcriptome-wide gene expression profiles in male and female rats within the corticolimbic system, including the cingulate cortex, nucleus accumbens medial shell (NAcS), ventral dentate gyrus and the basolateral amygdala (n = 22-24 per group/region).We found over 3000 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the NAcS between males and females. Of these DEGs in the NAcS, 303 showed sex-dependent conservation DEGs in humans and were significantly enriched for gene ontology terms related to blood vessel morphogenesis and regulation of cell migration. Single nuclei RNA sequencing in the NAcS of male and female rats identified widespread sex-dependent expression, with genes upregulated in females showing a notable enrichment for synaptic function. Female upregulated genes in astrocytes, Drd3+MSNs and oligodendrocyte were also enriched in several psychiatric genome-wide association studies (GWAS).Our data provide comprehensive evidence of sex- and cell-specific molecular profiles in the NAcS. Importantly these differences associate with anxiety, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and cross-disorder, suggesting an intrinsic molecular basis for sex-based differences in psychiatric disorders that strongly implicates the NAcS.This work was supported by funding from the Hope for Depression Research Foundation (MJM).Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

In this study, we will monitor the change in microRNAs (miRNAs) levels with 5-FU-based therapy at baseline and after 3 and 6 months of treatment to be correlated with their prognostic potential. The expression levels of 5 miRNAs, namely miRNA223-3p, miRNA20a-5p, miRNA17-5p, miRNA19a-3p, and miRNA7-5p, were measured in the peripheral blood of 77 CRC patients, along with the expression of 3 proteins PTEN, ERK, and EGFR. At baseline, CRC patients had significantly higher levels of circulating miRNAs than healthy controls. This level was reduced after 3 months of 5-FU-based therapy, then increased after 6 months significantly in responder patients compared to non-responders. MiRNA19a-3p showed that significant pattern of change in the subgroups of patients with high ERK, EGFR, and PTEN protein levels, and its 6 months level after 5-FU-based therapy showed significance for the hazard of increased risk of disease recurrence and progression.© 2023.

"37629588","Novel Pharmacological Targets of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders.","Life (Basel)","Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychopathological condition with a heterogeneous clinical picture that is complex and challenging to treat. Its multifaceted pathophysiology still remains an unresolved question and certainly contributes to this issue. The pharmacological treatment of PTSD is mainly empirical and centered on the serotonergic system. Since the therapeutic response to prescribed drugs targeting single symptoms is generally inconsistent, there is an urgent need for novel pathogenetic hypotheses, including different mediators and pathways. This paper was conceived as a narrative review with the aim of debating the current pharmacological treatment of PTSD and further highlighting prospective targets for future drugs. The authors accessed some of the main databases of scientific literature available and selected all the papers that fulfilled the purpose of the present work. The results showed that most of the current pharmacological treatments for PTSD are symptom-based and show only partial benefits; this largely reflects the limited knowledge of its neurobiology. Growing, albeit limited, data suggests that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, opioids, glutamate, cannabinoids, oxytocin, neuropeptide Y, and microRNA may play a role in the development of PTSD and could be targeted for novel treatments. Indeed, recent research indicates that examining different pathways might result in the development of novel and more efficient drugs."

Despite previous studies suggested its high heritability, its genetic basis, especially in ADHD, remains unclear. The current study aimed to comprehensively explore the genetic basis of visual-spatial working memory (VSWM) in ADHD using wide-ranging genetic analyses.The current study recruited a cohort consisted of 802 ADHD individuals, all met DSM-IV ADHD diagnostic criteria. VSWM was assessed by Rey-Osterrieth complex figure test (RCFT), which is a widely used psychological test include four memory indexes: detail delayed (DD), structure delayed (SD), structure immediate (SI), detail immediate (DI). Genetic analyses were conducted at the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), gene, pathway, polygenic and protein network levels. Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) were based on summary statistics of various psychiatric disorders, including ADHD, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), major depressive disorder (MDD), schizophrenia (SCZ), obsessive compulsive disorders (OCD), and substance use disorder (SUD).Analyses at the single-marker level did not yield significant results (5E-08). However, the potential signals with P values less than E-05 and their mapped genes suggested the regulation of VSWM involved both ocular and neural system related genes, moreover, ADHD-related genes were also involved. The gene-based analysis found RAB11FIP1, whose encoded protein modulates several neurodevelopment processes and visual system, as significantly associated with DD scores (P = 1.96E-06, Padj = 0.036). Candidate pathway enrichment analyses (N = 53) found that forebrain neuron fate commitment significantly enriched in DD (P = 4.78E-04, Padj = 0.025), and dopamine transport enriched in SD (P = 5.90E-04, Padj = 0.031). We also observed a significant negative relationship between DD scores and ADHD PRS scores (P = 0.0025, Empirical P = 0.048).Our results emphasized the joint contribution of ocular and neural genes in regulating VSWM. The study reveals a shared genetic basis between ADHD and VSWM, with GWAS indicating the involvement of ADHD-related genes in VSWM. Additionally, the PRS analysis identifies a significant relationship between ADHD-PRS and DD scores. Overall, our findings shed light on the genetic basis of VSWM deficits in ADHD, and may have important implications for future research and clinical practice.© 2023. BioMed Central Ltd."

We performed a bioinformatics analysis of lysosomal rupture to investigate whether lysosome-related genes (LRGs) are key in LUAD. The analysis identified 23 LRGs. Cytoscape visualization identified 10 core genes (CCNA2, DLGAP5, BUB1B, KIF2C, PBK, CDC20, NCAPG, ASPM, KIF4A, ANLN). With the 23 LRGs, we established a new risk scoring rule to classify patients with LUAD into high- and low-risk groups and verified the accuracy of the risk score by receiver operating characteristic curves and established a nomogram to evaluate clinical patients. Immunotherapy effectiveness between the high- and low-risk groups was evaluated based on the tumor mutational burden and analyses of immune cell infiltration and drug sensitivity. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that lysosomes were closely associated with glucose metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and the immune response in patients with LUAD.

In many sports performances, excellent coordination and agility are the keys to mastery. However, few studies have been devoted to identifying genetic influences on athletic performance.Methods: We generated a derived measure of coordination and agility from the data of hexagonal jumps and T-runs and conducted genome-wide association and meta-analysis studies focused on coordination and agility.Results: The phenotypic correlation and genetic covariance analysis indicated that hexagonal jumps and T-runs were possibly influenced by the same set of genetic factors (R = 0.27, genetic covariance = 0.59). Meta-analysis identified rs117047321 genome-wide significant association (N = 143, P < 10E-5) with coordination and agility, and this association was replicated in the replication group (N = 318,P < 0.05). The CG genotype samples of this single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) required a longer average movement time than the CC genotype samples, and the CG genotype only exists in Asia, which may belong to the East Asia-specific variation. This SNP is located onMYO5B, which is highly expressed in tissues such as the brain, heart, and muscle, suggesting that this locus might be a genetic factor related to human energy metabolism.Conclusion: Our study indicated that genetic factors can affect the athletic performance of coordination and agility.

"37628681","Implementing Core Genes and an Omnigenic Model for Behaviour Traits Prediction in Genomics.","Genes (Basel)","A high number of genome variants are associated with complex traits, mainly due to genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Using polygenic risk scores (PRSs) is a widely accepted method for calculating an individual's complex trait prognosis using such data. Unlike monogenic traits, the practical implementation of complex traits by applying this method still falls behind. Calculating PRSs from all GWAS data has limited practical usability in behaviour traits due to statistical noise and the small effect size from a high number of genome variants involved. From a behaviour traits perspective, complex traits are explored using the concept of core genes from an omnigenic model, aiming to employ a simplified calculation version. Simplification may reduce the accuracy compared to a complete PRS encompassing all trait-associated variants. Integrating genome data with datasets from various disciplines, such as IT and psychology, could lead to better complex trait prediction. This review elucidates the significance of clear biological pathways in understanding behaviour traits. Specifically, it highlights the essential role of genes related to hormones, enzymes, and neurotransmitters as robust core genes in shaping these traits. Significant variations in core genes are prominently observed in behaviour traits such as stress response, impulsivity, and substance use."

Here, we integrated multiple published datasets of TWAS, gene coexpression, and differential gene expression analysis to prioritize SCZ candidate genes for functional study. Convergent evidence prioritized Propionyl-CoA Carboxylase Subunit Beta (PCCB), a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial gene, as an SCZ risk gene. However, the PCCB's contribution to SCZ risk has not been investigated before. Using dual luciferase reporter assay, we identified that SCZ-associated SNPs rs6791142 and rs35874192, two eQTL SNPs for PCCB, showed differential allelic effects on transcriptional activities. PCCB knockdown in human forebrain organoids (hFOs) followed by RNA sequencing analysis revealed dysregulation of genes enriched with multiple neuronal functions including gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic synapse. The metabolomic and mitochondrial function analyses confirmed the decreased GABA levels resulted from inhibited tricarboxylic acid cycle in PCCB knockdown hFOs. Multielectrode array recording analysis showed that PCCB knockdown in hFOs resulted into SCZ-related phenotypes including hyper-neuroactivities and decreased synchronization of neural network. In summary, this study utilized hFOs-based multi-omics analyses and revealed that PCCB downregulation may contribute to SCZ risk through regulating GABAergic pathways, highlighting the mitochondrial function in SCZ.© 2023.

"37607232","A persistent major mutation in canonical jasmonate signaling is embedded in an herbivory-elicited gene network.","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","When insect herbivores attack plants, elicitors from oral secretions and regurgitants (OS) enter wounds during feeding, eliciting defense responses. These generally require plant jasmonate (JA) signaling, specifically, a jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine (JA-Ile) burst, for their activation and are well studied in the native tobaccoNicotiana attenuata. We used intraspecific diversity captured in a 26-parent MAGIC population planted in nature and an updated genome assembly to impute natural variation in the OS-elicited JA-Ile burst linked to a mutation in the JA-Ile biosynthetic geneNaJAR4. Experiments revealed thatNaJAR4variants were associated with higher fitness in the absence of herbivores but compromised foliar defenses, with twoNaJARhomologues (4 and 6) complementing each other spatially and temporally. From decade-long seed collections of natural populations, we uncovered enzymatically inactive variants occurring at variable frequencies, consistent with a balancing selection regime maintaining variants. Integrative analyses of OS-induced transcriptomes and metabolomes of natural accessions revealed thatNaJAR4is embedded in a nonlinear complex gene coexpression network orchestrating responses to OS, which we tested by silencing four hub genes in two connected coexpressed networks and examining their OS-elicited metabolic responses. Lines silenced in two hub genes (NaGLRandNaFB67) co-occurring in theNaJAR4/6module showed responses proportional to JA-Ile accumulations; two from an adjacent module (NaERFandNaFB61) had constitutively expressed defenses with high resistance. We infer that mutations with large fitness consequences can persist in natural populations due to compensatory responses from gene networks, which allow for diversification in conserved signaling pathways and are generally consistent with predictions of an omnigene model."

The highest proportion of share genetic regulation is detected between gene expression and proteins (66.6%), with a further median shared genetic associations across 49 different tissues of 78.3% and 62.4% between plasma proteins and gene expression. We represent the genetic and molecular associations in networks including 2828 known GWAS variants, showing that GWAS variants are more often connected to gene expression in trans than other molecular phenotypes in the network.

"37603597","Mitonuclear interactions shape both direct and parental effects of diet on fitness and involve a SNP in mitoribosomal 16s rRNA.","PLoS Biol","Nutrition is a primary determinant of health, but responses to nutrition vary with genotype. Epistasis between mitochondrial and nuclear genomes may cause some of this variation, but which mitochondrial loci and nutrients participate in complex gene-by-gene-by-diet interactions? Furthermore, it remains unknown whether mitonuclear epistasis is involved only in the immediate responses to changes in diet, or whether mitonuclear genotype might modulate sensitivity to variation in parental nutrition, to shape intergenerational fitness responses. Here, in Drosophila melanogaster, we show that mitonuclear epistasis shapes fitness responses to variation in dietary lipids and amino acids. We also show that mitonuclear genotype modulates the parental effect of dietary lipid and amino acid variation on offspring fitness. Effect sizes for the interactions between diet, mitogenotype, and nucleogenotype were equal to or greater than the main effect of diet for some traits, suggesting that dietary impacts cannot be understood without first accounting for these interactions. Associating phenotype to mtDNA variation in a subset of populations implicated a C/T polymorphism in mt:lrRNA, which encodes the 16S rRNA of the mitochondrial ribosome. This association suggests that directionally different responses to dietary changes can result from variants on mtDNA that do not change protein coding sequence, dependent on epistatic interactions with variation in the nuclear genome.Copyright: © 2023 Dobson et al.

We find that trait polygenicity is severely reduced in the island populations compared to the continental North African population. Further, trait architectures and reconstructed allelic histories best fit a model of strong directional selection in the islands in accord with a Fisher-Orr adaptive walk. Consistent with this, we find that large-effect variants that disrupt major flowering time genes (FRI and FLC) arose first, followed by smaller effect variants, including ATX2 L125F, which is associated with a 4-day reduction in flowering time. The most recently arising flowering time-associated loci are not known to be directly involved in flowering time, consistent with an omnigenic signature developing as the population approaches its trait optimum. Surprisingly, we find no effect in the natural population of EDI-Cvi-0 (CRY2 V367M), an allele for which an effect was previously validated by introgression into a Eurasian line. Instead, our results suggest the previously observed effect of the EDI-Cvi-0 allele on flowering time likely depends on genetic background, due to an epistatic interaction. Altogether, our results provide an empirical example of the effects demographic history and selection has on trait architecture.© The Author(s) 2023.

"37588924","Evolution and dysfunction of human cognitive and social traits: A transcriptional regulation perspective.","Evol Hum Sci","Evolutionary changes in brain and craniofacial development have endowed humans with unique cognitive and social skills, but also predisposed us to debilitating disorders in which these traits are disrupted. What are the developmental genetic underpinnings that connect the adaptive evolution of our cognition and sociality with the persistence of mental disorders with severe negative fitness effects? We argue that loss of function of genes involved in transcriptional regulation represents a crucial link between the evolution and dysfunction of human cognitive and social traits. The argument is based on the haploinsufficiency of many transcriptional regulator genes, which makes them particularly sensitive to loss-of-function mutations. We discuss how human brain and craniofacial traits evolved through partial loss of function (i.e. reduced expression) of these genes, a perspective compatible with the idea of human self-domestication. Moreover, we explain why selection against loss-of-function variants supports the view that mutation-selection-drift, rather than balancing selection, underlies the persistence of psychiatric disorders. Finally, we discuss testable predictions.© The Author(s) 2022."
"37566035",NA,NA,"Cardiotoxicity due to anthracyclines (CDA) affects cancer patients, but we cannot predict who may suffer from this complication. CDA is a complex trait with a polygenic component that is mainly unidentified. We propose that levels of intermediate molecular phenotypes (IMPs) in the myocardium associated with histopathological damage could explain CDA susceptibility, so variants of genes encoding these IMPs could identify patients susceptible to this complication. Thus, a genetically heterogeneous cohort of mice (n= 165) generated by backcrossing were treated with doxorubicin and docetaxel. We quantified heart fibrosis using an Ariol slide scanner and intramyocardial levels of IMPs using multiplex bead arrays and QPCR. We identified quantitative trait loci linked to IMPs (ipQTLs) and cdaQTLs via linkage analysis. In three cancer patient cohorts, CDA was quantified using echocardiography or Cardiac Magnetic Resonance. CDA behaves as a complex trait in the mouse cohort. IMP levels in the myocardium were associated with CDA. ipQTLs integrated into genetic models with cdaQTLs account for more CDA phenotypic variation than that explained by cda-QTLs alone. Allelic forms of genes encoding IMPs associated with CDA in mice, including AKT1, MAPK14, MAPK8, STAT3, CAS3, and TP53, are genetic determinants of CDA in patients. Two genetic risk scores for pediatric patients (n= 71) and women with breast cancer (n= 420) were generated using machine-learning Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression. Thus, IMPs associated with heart damage identify genetic markers of CDA risk, thereby allowing more personalized patient management."
"37561813","Nonlinear expression patterns and multiple shifts in gene network interactions underlie robust phenotypic change in Drosophila melanogaster selected for night sleep duration.","PLoS Comput Biol","All but the simplest phenotypes are believed to result from interactions between two or more genes forming complex networks of gene regulation. Sleep is a complex trait known to depend on the system of feedback loops of the circadian clock, and on many other genes; however, the main components regulating the phenotype and how they interact remain an unsolved puzzle. Genomic and transcriptomic data may well provide part of the answer, but a full account requires a suitable quantitative framework. Here we conducted an artificial selection experiment for sleep duration with RNA-seq data acquired each generation. The phenotypic results are robust across replicates and previous experiments, and the transcription data provides a high-resolution, time-course data set for the evolution of sleep-related gene expression. In addition to a Hierarchical Generalized Linear Model analysis of differential expression that accounts for experimental replicates we develop a flexible Gaussian Process model that estimates interactions between genes. 145 gene pairs are found to have interactions that are different from controls. Our method appears to be not only more specific than standard correlation metrics but also more sensitive, finding correlations not significant by other methods. Statistical predictions were compared to experimental data from public databases on gene interactions. Mutations of candidate genes implicated by our results affected night sleep, and gene expression profiles largely met predicted gene-gene interactions.Copyright: This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

"37485750",NA,NA,"The complexity of many cellular and organismal traits results from the integration of genetic and environmental factors via molecular networks. Network structure and effect propagation are best understood at the level of functional modules, but so far, no concept has been established to include the global network state. Here, we show when and how genetic perturbations lead to molecular changes that are confined to small parts of a network versus when they lead to modulation of network states. Integrating multi-omics profiling of genetically heterogeneous budding and fission yeast strains with an array of cellular traits identified a central state transition of the yeast molecular network that is related to PKA and TOR (PT) signaling. Genetic variants affecting this PT state globally shifted the molecular network along a single-dimensional axis, thereby modulating processes including energy and amino acid metabolism, transcription, translation, cell cycle control, and cellular stress response. We propose that genetic effects can propagate through large parts of molecular networks because of the functional requirement to centrally coordinate the activity of fundamental cellular processes.© 2023 The Authors.

"37437111","Inferring sparse structure in genotype-phenotype maps.","Genetics","Correlation among multiple phenotypes across related individuals may reflect some pattern of shared genetic architecture: individual genetic loci affect multiple phenotypes (an effect known as pleiotropy), creating observable relationships between phenotypes. A natural hypothesis is that pleiotropic effects reflect a relatively small set of common ""core"" cellular processes: each genetic locus affects one or a few core processes, and these core processes in turn determine the observed phenotypes. Here, we propose a method to infer such structure in genotype-phenotype data. Our approach, sparse structure discovery (SSD) is based on a penalized matrix decomposition designed to identify latent structure that is low-dimensional (many fewer core processes than phenotypes and genetic loci), locus-sparse (each locus affects few core processes), and/or phenotype-sparse (each phenotype is influenced by few core processes). Our use of sparsity as a guide in the matrix decomposition is motivated by the results of a novel empirical test indicating evidence of sparse structure in several recent genotype-phenotype datasets. First, we use synthetic data to show that our SSD approach can accurately recover core processes if each genetic locus affects few core processes or if each phenotype is affected by few core processes. Next, we apply the method to three datasets spanning adaptive mutations in yeast, genotoxin robustness assay in human cell lines, and genetic loci identified from a yeast cross, and evaluate the biological plausibility of the core process identified. More generally, we propose sparsity as a guiding prior for resolving latent structure in empirical genotype-phenotype maps.© The Author(s) 2023.

Owing to the association of opiate use with multiple human cancers and neurological disorders, seeking for genetic and epigenetic effects of opium can pave the way for early diagnosis of major health defects in addicted users. Accordingly, the present study aimed to determine the methylation status of the promoter of two genes, which are actively involved in neurodevelopment and cancer evolution.DNA was isolated from peripheral blood of 28 opium abusers and 19 healthy controls and then subjected to sonication. Sonicated DNAs undergone methylated DNA immunoprecipitation-real time polymerase chain reaction (MeDIP-Real Time PCR) using specific primer pairs designed forHOXA9andNISCHgenes. Obtained data were analyzed using SPSS software.HOXA9andNISCHgenes were found to be significantly methylated in addicted users compared to controls (P<0.001) which was significantly associated with the mean of the age regardingHOXA9gene (P=0.002). Neither opium amount nor duration or route of using was associated with the methylation status ofHOXA9orNISCHgenes.Hypermethylation ofHOXA9andNISCHgenes as tumor suppressor in opium-addicted individuals can be considered as confirmatory evidence for carcinogenesis of opium.

Studying CTCs systematically is technically challenging due to their extreme rarity and heterogeneity and the lack of specific markers to specify metastasis-initiating CTCs. With cutting-edge technology, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides insights into the biology of metastatic processes driven by CTCs. Transcriptomics analysis of single CTCs can decipher tumor heterogeneity and phenotypic plasticity for exploring promising novel therapeutic targets. The integrated approach provides a perspective on the mechanisms underlying tumor development and interrogates CTCs interactions with other blood cell types, particularly those of the immune system. This review aims to comprehensively describe the current study on CTC transcriptomic analysis through scRNA-seq technology. We emphasize the workflow for scRNA-seq analysis of CTCs, including enrichment, single cell isolation, and bioinformatic tools applied for this purpose. Furthermore, we elucidated the translational knowledge from the transcriptomic profile of individual CTCs and the biology of cancer metastasis for developing effective therapeutics through targeting key pathways in CTCs."
"37658059","Transposable elements as tissue-specific enhancers in cancers of endodermal lineage.","Nat Commun","Transposable elements (TE) are repetitive genomic elements that harbor binding sites for human transcription factors (TF). A regulatory role for TEs has been suggested in embryonal development and diseases such as cancer but systematic investigation of their functions has been limited by their widespread silencing in the genome. Here, we utilize unbiased massively parallel reporter assay data using a whole human genome library to identify TEs with functional enhancer activity in two human cancer types of endodermal lineage, colorectal and liver cancers. We show that the identified TE enhancers are characterized by genomic features associated with active enhancers, such as epigenetic marks and TF binding. Importantly, we identify distinct TE subfamilies that function as tissue-specific enhancers, namely MER11- and LTR12-elements in colon and liver cancers, respectively. These elements are bound by distinct TFs in each cell type, and they have predicted associations to differentially expressed genes. In conclusion, these data demonstrate how different cancer types can utilize distinct TEs as tissue-specific enhancers, paving the way for comprehensive understanding of the role of TEs as bona fide enhancers in the cancer genomes.© 2023.

"37646011","Srd5a1 is Differentially Regulated and Methylated During Prepubertal Development in the Ovary and Hypothalamus.","J Endocr Soc","5α-reductase-1 catalyzes production of various steroids, including neurosteroids. We reported previously that expression of its encoding gene,Srd5a1,drops in murine ovaries and hypothalamic preoptic area (POA) after early-life immune stress, seemingly contributing to delayed puberty and ovarian follicle depletion, and in the ovaries the first intron was more methylated at two CpGs. Here, we hypothesized that this CpG-containing locus comprises a methylation-sensitive transcriptional enhancer forSrd5a1. We found that ovarianSrd5a1mRNA increased 8-fold and methylation of the same two CpGs decreased up to 75% between postnatal days 10 and 30. Estradiol (E2) levels rise during this prepubertal stage, and exposure of ovarian cells to E2increasedSrd5a1expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation in an ovarian cell line confirmed ESR1 binding to this differentially methylated genomic region and enrichment of the enhancer modification, H3K4me1. Targeting dCas9-DNMT3 to this locus increased CpG2 methylation 2.5-fold and abolished theSrd5a1response to E2. In the POA,Srd5a1mRNA levels decreased 70% between postnatal days 7 and 10 and then remained constant without correlation to CpG methylation levels.Srd5a1mRNA levels did not respond to E2in hypothalamic GT1-7 cells, even after dCas9-TET1 reduced CpG1 methylation by 50%. The neonatal drop in POASrd5a1expression occurs at a time of increasing glucocorticoids, and treatment of GT1-7 cells with dexamethasone reducedSrd5a1mRNA levels; chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed glucocorticoid receptor binding at the enhancer. Our findings on the tissue-specific regulation ofSrd5a1and its methylation-sensitive control by E2in the ovaries illuminate epigenetic mechanisms underlying reproductive phenotypic variation that impact life-long health.© The Author(s) 2023.

"37598138","Paternal high-fat diet altered SETD2 gene methylation in sperm of F0 and F1 mice.","Genes Nutr","Paternal high-fat diet (HFD) can alter the epigenetics of sperm DNA, resulting in the transmission of obesity-related traits to the offspring. Previous studies have mainly focused on the HFD-induced changes in DNA methylation of imprinted genes, overlooking the potential involvement of non-imprinted genes in this process. SETD2, an important epigenetically-regulated gene known for its response to environmental stress, remains poorly understood in the context of high-fat diet-induced epigenetic changes. Here we examined the effect of obesity from a HFD on paternal SETD2 expression and methylation in sperm, and embryos at the blastocyst stage and during subsequent development, to determine the alteration of SETD2 in paternal intergenerational and transgenerational inheritance. The result showed that mice fed with HFD for two months had significantly increased SETD2 expression in testis and sperm. The paternal HFD significantly altered the DNA methylation level with 20 of the 26 CpG sites being changed in sperm from F0 mice. Paternal high-fat diet increased apoptotic index and decreased total cell number of blastocysts, which were closely correlated with DNA methylation level of sperm. Out of the 26 CpG sites, we also found three CpG sites that were significantly changed in the sperm from F1 mice, which meant that the methylation changes at these three CpG sites were maintained.In conclusion, we found that paternal exposure to an HFD disrupted the methylation pattern of SETD2 in the sperm of F0 mice and resulted in perturbed SETD2 expression. Furthermore, the paternal high-fat diet influenced embryo apoptosis and development, possibly through the SETD2 pathway. The altered methylation of SETD2 in sperm induced by paternal HFD partially persisted in the sperm of the F1 generation, highlighting the role of SETD2 as an epigenetic carrier for paternal intergenerational and transgenerational inheritance.© 2023.

However, identifying distal regulatory elements and connecting them with their target genes remains challenging. Here, we present MethNet, a pipeline that integrates large-scale DNA methylation and gene expression data across multiple cancers, to uncover novel cis regulatory elements (CREs) in a 1Mb region around every promoter in the genome. MethNet identifies clusters of highly ranked CREs, referred to as 'hubs', which contribute to the regulation of multiple genes and significantly affect patient survival. Promoter-capture Hi-C confirmed that highly ranked associations involve physical interactions between CREs and their gene targets, and CRISPRi based scRNA Perturb-seq validated the functional impact of CREs. Thus, MethNet-identified CREs represent a valuable resource for unraveling complex mechanisms underlying gene expression, and for prioritizing the verification of predicted non-coding disease hotspots."
"37549271","DNA methylation in the mouse cochlea promotes maturation of supporting cells and contributes to the failure of hair cell regeneration.","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","Mammalian hair cells do not functionally regenerate in adulthood but can regenerate at embryonic and neonatal stages in mice by direct transdifferentiation of neighboring supporting cells into new hair cells. Previous work showed loss of transdifferentiation potential of supporting cells is in part due to H3K4me1 enhancer decommissioning of the hair cell gene regulatory network during the first postnatal week. However, inhibiting this decommissioning only partially preserves transdifferentiation potential. Therefore, we explored other repressive epigenetic modifications that may be responsible for this loss of plasticity. We find supporting cells progressively accumulate DNA methylation at promoters of developmentally regulated hair cell genes. Specifically, DNA methylation overlaps with binding sites of Atoh1, a key transcription factor for hair cell fate. We further show that DNA hypermethylation replaces H3K27me3-mediated repression of hair cell genes in mature supporting cells, and is accompanied by progressive loss of chromatin accessibility, suggestive of facultative heterochromatin formation. Another subset of hair cell loci is hypermethylated in supporting cells, but not in hair cells. Ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzyme-mediated demethylation of these hypermethylated sites is necessary for neonatal supporting cells to transdifferentiate into hair cells. We also observe changes in chromatin accessibility of supporting cell subtypes at the single-cell level with increasing age: Gene programs promoting sensory epithelium development loses chromatin accessibility, in favor of gene programs that promote physiological maturation and function of the cochlea. We also find chromatin accessibility is partially recovered in a chronically deafened mouse model, which holds promise for future translational efforts in hearing restoration."
"37460697","H3K36 methylation maintains cell identity by regulating opposing lineage programmes.","Nat Cell Biol","The epigenetic mechanisms that maintain differentiated cell states remain incompletely understood. Here we employed histone mutants to uncover a crucial role for H3K36 methylation in the maintenance of cell identities across diverse developmental contexts. Focusing on the experimental induction of pluripotency, we show that H3K36M-mediated depletion of H3K36 methylation endows fibroblasts with a plastic state poised to acquire pluripotency in nearly all cells. At a cellular level, H3K36M facilitates epithelial plasticity by rendering fibroblasts insensitive to TGFβ signals. At a molecular level, H3K36M enables the decommissioning of mesenchymal enhancers and the parallel activation of epithelial/stem cell enhancers. This enhancer rewiring is Tet dependent and redirects Sox2 from promiscuous somatic to pluripotency targets. Our findings reveal a previously unappreciated dual role for H3K36 methylation in the maintenance of cell identity by integrating a crucial developmental pathway into sustained expression of cell-type-specific programmes, and by opposing the expression of alternative lineage programmes through enhancer methylation.© 2023.

Despite the development of treatment options and methods to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2, certain patients experience critical illness and numerous deaths have occurred.

The present study included a total of 1,813 patients hospitalized with pneumonia and SARS-CoV-2 infection, and mortality rates associated with each patient characteristic were calculated. The characteristics associated with the highest risk of mortality were as follows: Age >90 years (OR, 105; 95% CI, 17.70-2,023.00); oxygen saturation at the time of hospital admission <89% in room air (OR, 14.3; 95% CI, 7.54-30.7), admission to the Intensive Care Unit (OR, 39.4; 95% CI, 27.7-57.0); and a neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio of 8.76-54.2 (OR, 14; 95% CI, 7.62-29.0).

Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to determine the association between ORN rates and PIV levels. Spearman correlation analysis was used to examine the probable intergroup correlations. The potential link between the pretreatment PIV levels and the post-treatment ORN rates was determined as the primary objective.21 (10.0%) of 210 eligible patients were diagnosed with ORN. The optimal pre-CCRT PIV cutoff was 833, which separated patients into two PIV groups with divergent ORN prevalence estimates: Group 1: PIV < 833 (N = 153), and Group 2: PIV ≥ 833 (N = 57). The comparison analysis found that the PIV ≥ 833 cohort had significantly higher ORN rates than the PIV < 833 cohort (29.8% vs. 2.6%; P < 0.001). Other characteristics linked to significantly higher ORN rates were the patient's continuing smoking, the use of the Three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy technique, the mean mandibular dose of ≥ 58.1 Gy, the number of tooth extractions before CCRT ≥ 4, and the presence of tooth extractions after CCRT.

Distinguishing cell-type-specific molecular features from cancer-specific characteristics is challenging.We analyze whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data on 45 esophageal tumor and nonmalignant samples from both subtypes. We develop a novel sequence-aware method to identify large partially methylated domains (PMDs), revealing profound heterogeneity at both methylation level and genomic distribution of PMDs across tumor samples. We identify subtype-specific PMDs that are associated with repressive transcription, chromatin B compartments and high somatic mutation rate. While genomic locations of these PMDs are pre-established in normal cells, the degree of loss is significantly higher in tumors. We find that cell-type-specific deposition of H3K36me2 may underlie genomic distribution of PMDs. At a smaller genomic scale, both cell-type- and cancer-specific differentially methylated regions (DMRs) are identified for each subtype. Using binding motif analysis within these DMRs, we show that a cell-type-specific transcription factor HNF4A maintains the binding sites that it generates in normal cells, while establishing new binding sites cooperatively with novel partners such as FOSL1 in esophageal adenocarcinoma. Finally, leveraging pan-tissue single-cell and pan-cancer epigenomic datasets, we demonstrate that a substantial fraction of cell-type-specific PMDs and DMRs identified here in esophageal cancer are actually markers that co-occur in other cancers originating from related cell types.These findings advance our understanding of DNA methylation dynamics at various genomic scales in normal and malignant states, providing novel mechanistic insights into cell-type- and cancer-specific epigenetic regulations.© 2023.

"37614917","Phenotypic plasticity in the monoclonal marbled crayfish is associated with very low genetic diversity but pronounced epigenetic diversity.","Curr Zool","Clonal organisms are particularly useful to investigate the contribution of epigenetics to phenotypic plasticity, because confounding effects of genetic variation are negligible. In the last decade, the apomictic parthenogenetic marbled crayfish,Procambarus virginalis, has been developed as a model to investigate the relationships between phenotypic plasticity and genetic and epigenetic diversity in detail. This crayfish originated about 30 years ago by autotriploidy from a single slough crayfishProcambarus fallax. As the result of human releases and active spreading, marbled crayfish has established numerous populations in very diverse habitats in 22 countries from the tropics to cold temperate regions. Studies in the laboratory and field revealed considerable plasticity in coloration, spination, morphometric parameters, growth, food preference, population structure, trophic position, and niche width. Illumina and PacBio whole-genome sequencing of marbled crayfish from representatives of 19 populations in Europe and Madagascar demonstrated extremely low genetic diversity within and among populations, indicating that the observed phenotypic diversity and ability to live in strikingly different environments are not due to adaptation by selection on genetic variation. In contrast, considerable differences were found between populations in the DNA methylation patterns of hundreds of genes, suggesting that the environmentally induced phenotypic plasticity is mediated by epigenetic mechanisms and corresponding changes in gene expression. Specific DNA methylation fingerprints persisted in local populations over successive years indicating the existence of epigenetic ecotypes, but there is presently no information as to whether these epigenetic signatures are transgenerationally inherited or established anew in each generation and whether the recorded phenotypic plasticity is adaptive or nonadaptive.© The Author(s) 2022.

However, whether dietary patterns can modify the association of long-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and its constituents with hypertension defined by the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline has not been evaluated.We included 47,501 Chinese adults from a nationwide cross-sectional study. PM2.5and five constituents were estimated by satellite-based random forest models. Dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) and alternative Mediterranean diet (AMED) scores were calculated for each participant. Interactions between dietary patterns and air pollution were examined by adding a multiplicative interaction term to logistic models.Long-term exposure to PM2.5and its constituents was associated with an increased risk of hypertension and stage 1-2 hypertension. The DASH and AMED scores significantly modified these associations, as individuals with higher scores had a significantly lower risk of air pollution-related hypertension and stage 1-2 hypertension (P-interaction < 0.05), except for interaction between PM2.5, sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, and AMED score on stage 1 hypertension. For each IQR increase in PM2.5, participants with the lowest DASH and AMED quintiles had hypertension risk with ORs (95%CI) of 1.20 (1.10, 1.30) and 1.19 (1.09, 1.29), whereas those with the highest DASH and AMED quintiles had lower risks with 0.98 (0.91, 1.05) and 1.04 (0.97, 1.11).

"37577715","scMD: cell type deconvolution using single-cell DNA methylation references.","bioRxiv","The proliferation of single-cell RNA sequencing data has led to the widespread use of cellular deconvolution, aiding the extraction of cell type-specific information from extensive bulk data. However, those advances have been mostly limited to transcriptomic data. With recent development in single-cell DNA methylation (scDNAm), new avenues have been opened for deconvolving bulk DNAm data, particularly for solid tissues like the brain that lack cell-type references. Due to technical limitations, current scDNAm sequences represent a small proportion of the whole genome for each single cell, and those detected regions differ across cells. This makes scDNAm data ultrahigh dimensional and ultra-sparse. To deal with these challenges, we introduce scMD (single cell Methylation Deconvolution), a cellular deconvolution framework to reliably estimate cell type fractions from tissue-level DNAm data. To analyze large-scale complex scDNAm data, scMD employs a statistical approach to aggregate scDNAm data at the cell cluster level, identify cell-type marker DNAm sites, and create a precise cell-type signature matrix that surpasses state-of-the-art sorted-cell or RNA-derived references. Through thorough benchmarking in several datasets, we demonstrate scMD's superior performance in estimating cellular fractions from bulk DNAm data. With scMD-estimated cellular fractions, we identify cell type fractions and cell type-specific differentially methylated cytosines associated with Alzheimer's disease."

We assessed the accuracy of pediatric epigenetic clocks in gestational and chronological age determination.Our study used data from seven tissue types on three DNA methylation profiling microarrays and found that the Knight and Bohlin clocks performed similarly for blood cells, while the Lee clock was superior for placental samples. The pediatric-buccal-epigenetic clock performed the best for pediatric buccal samples, while the Horvath clock is recommended for children's blood cell samples.

"37626025","DNA methylation at the suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) gene influences height in childhood.","Nat Commun","Human height is strongly influenced by genetics but the contribution of modifiable epigenetic factors is under-explored, particularly in low and middle-income countries (LMIC). We investigate links between blood DNA methylation and child height in four LMIC cohorts (n = 1927) and identify a robust association at three CpGs in the suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) gene which replicates in a high-income country cohort (n = 879). SOCS3 methylation (SOCS3m)-height associations are independent of genetic effects. Mendelian randomization analysis confirms a causal effect of SOCS3m on height. In longitudinal analysis, SOCS3m explains a maximum 9.5% of height variance in mid-childhood while the variance explained by height polygenic risk score increases from birth to 21 years. Children's SOCS3m is associated with prenatal maternal folate and socio-economic status. In-vitro characterization confirms a regulatory effect of SOCS3m on gene expression. Our findings suggest epigenetic modifications may play an important role in driving child height in LMIC.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."
"37592257","Association between plant-based dietary pattern and biological aging trajectory in a large prospective cohort.","BMC Med","Aging is a dynamic and heterogeneous process that may better be captured by trajectories of aging biomarkers. Biological age has been advocated as a better biomarker of aging than chronological age, and plant-based dietary patterns have been found to be linked to aging. However, the associations of biological age trajectories with mortality and plant-based dietary patterns remained unclear.Using group-based trajectory modeling approach, we identified distinctive aging trajectory groups among 12,784 participants based on a recently developed biological aging measure acquired at four-time points within an 8-year period. We then examined associations between aging trajectories and quintiles of plant-based dietary patterns assessed by overall plant-based diet index (PDI), healthful PDI (hPDI), and unhealthful PDI (uPDI) among 10,191 participants who had complete data on dietary intake, using multivariable multinomial logistics regression adjusting for sociodemographic and lifestyles factors. Cox proportional hazards regression models were applied to investigate the association between aging trajectories and all-cause mortality.We identified three latent classes of accelerated aging trajectories: slow aging, medium-degree, and high-degree accelerated aging trajectories. Participants who had higher PDI or hPDI had lower odds of being in medium-degree (OR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.65, 0.86 for PDI; OR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.62, 0.85 for hPDI) or high-degree (OR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.46, 0.86 for PDI; OR = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.44, 0.88 for hPDI) accelerated aging trajectories. Participants in the highest quintile of uPDI were more likely to be in medium-degree (OR = 1.72, 95% CI: 1.48, 1.99) or high-degree (OR = 1.70, 95% CI: 1.21, 2.38) accelerated aging trajectories. With a mean follow-up time of 8.40 years and 803 (6.28%) participants died by the end of follow-up, we found that participants in medium-degree (HR = 1.56, 95% CI: 1.29, 1.89) or high-degree (HR = 3.72, 95% CI: 2.73, 5.08) accelerated aging trajectory groups had higher risks of death than those in the slow aging trajectory.We identified three distinctive aging trajectories in a large Asian cohort and found that adopting a plant-based dietary pattern, especially when rich in healthful plant foods, was associated with substantially lowered pace of aging.© 2023.

To evaluate the role of rare coding variants more comprehensively, we performed a meta-analysis across three large whole-exome sequencing datasets, containing 26,368 female cases and 217,673 female controls. Burden tests were performed for protein-truncating and rare missense variants in 15,616 and 18,601 genes, respectively. Associations between protein-truncating variants and breast cancer were identified for the following six genes at exome-wide significance (P < 2.5 × 10-6): the five known susceptibility genes ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2 and PALB2, together with MAP3K1. Associations were also observed for LZTR1, ATR and BARD1 with P < 1 × 10-4. Associations between predicted deleterious rare missense or protein-truncating variants and breast cancer were additionally identified for CDKN2A at exome-wide significance.

"37580702","Current views on meningeal lymphatics and immunity in aging and Alzheimer's disease.","Mol Neurodegener","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an aging-related form of dementia associated with the accumulation of pathological aggregates of amyloid beta and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. These phenomena are accompanied by exacerbated inflammation and marked neuronal loss, which altogether contribute to accelerated cognitive decline. The multifactorial nature of AD, allied to our still limited knowledge of its etiology and pathophysiology, have lessened our capacity to develop effective treatments for AD patients. Over the last few decades, genome wide association studies and biomarker development, alongside mechanistic experiments involving animal models, have identified different immune components that play key roles in the modulation of brain pathology in AD, affecting its progression and severity. As we will relay in this review, much of the recent efforts have been directed to better understanding the role of brain innate immunity, and particularly of microglia. However, and despite the lack of diversity within brain resident immune cells, the brain border tissues, especially the meninges, harbour a considerable number of different types and subtypes of adaptive and innate immune cells. Alongside microglia, which have taken the centre stage as important players in AD research, there is new and exciting evidence pointing to adaptive immune cells, namely T and B cells found in the brain and its meninges, as important modulators of neuroinflammation and neuronal (dys)function in AD. Importantly, a genuine and functional lymphatic vascular network is present around the brain in the outermost meningeal layer, the dura. The meningeal lymphatics are directly connected to the peripheral lymphatic system in different mammalian species, including humans, and play a crucial role in preserving a ""healthy"" immune surveillance of the CNS, by shaping immune responses, not only locally at the meninges, but also at the level of the brain tissue. In this review, we will provide a comprehensive view on our current knowledge about the meningeal lymphatic vasculature, emphasizing its described roles in modulating CNS fluid and macromolecule drainage, meningeal and brain immunity, as well as glial and neuronal function in aging and in AD.© 2023.

"37569309","Compromised Mitotic Fidelity in Human Pluripotent Stem Cells.","Int J Mol Sci","Human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), which include both embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells, are widely used in fundamental and applied biomedical research. They have been instrumental for better understanding development and cell differentiation processes, disease origin and progression and can aid in the discovery of new drugs. PSCs also hold great potential in regenerative medicine to treat or diminish the effects of certain debilitating diseases, such as degenerative disorders. However, some concerns have recently been raised over their safety for use in regenerative medicine. One of the major concerns is the fact that PSCs are prone to errors in passing the correct number of chromosomes to daughter cells, resulting in aneuploid cells. Aneuploidy, characterised by an imbalance in chromosome number, elicits the upregulation of different stress pathways that are deleterious to cell homeostasis, impair proper embryo development and potentiate cancer development. In this review, we will summarize known molecular mechanisms recently revealed to impair mitotic fidelity in human PSCs and the consequences of the decreased mitotic fidelity of these cells. We will finish with speculative views on how the physiological characteristics of PSCs can affect the mitotic machinery and how their suboptimal mitotic fidelity may be circumvented."

However, the prevalence and the clinical and biological implications of histone gene mutations in malignant tumors remain incompletely defined. To address these knowledge gaps, we analyzed somatic mutations in 88 linker and core histone genes across 12,743 tumors from pediatric, adolescent and young adult (AYA), and adult cancer patients. We established a pan-cancer histone mutation atlas contextualized by patient age, survival outcome, and tumor location. Overall, 11% of tumors harbored somatic histone mutations, with the highest rates observed among chondrosarcoma (67%), pediatric high-grade glioma (pHGG, >60%), and lymphoma (>30%). Previously unreported histone mutations were discovered in pHGG and other pediatric brain tumors, extending the spectrum of histone gene alterations associated with these cancers. Histone mutation status predicted patient survival outcome in tumor entities including adrenocortical carcinoma. Recurrent pan-cancer histone mutation hotspots were defined and shown to converge on evolutionarily conserved and functional residues. Moreover, we studied histone gene mutations in 1700 pan-cancer cell lines to validate the prevalence and spectrum of histone mutations seen in primary tumors and derived histone-associated drug response profiles, revealing candidate drugs targeting histone mutant cancer cells. This study presents the first-of-its-kind atlas of both core and linker histone mutations across pediatric, AYA, and adult cancers, providing a framework by which specific cancers may be redefined in the context of histone and chromatin alterations.© 2023.

"37626340","The inactive X chromosome accumulates widespread epigenetic variability with age.","Clin Epigenetics","Loss of epigenetic control is a hallmark of aging. Among the most prominent roles of epigenetic mechanisms is the inactivation of one of two copies of the X chromosome in females through DNA methylation. Hence, age-related disruption of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) may contribute to the aging process in women.We analyzed 9,777 CpGs on the X chromosome in whole blood samples from 2343 females and 1688 males (Illumina 450k methylation array) and replicated findings in duplicate using one whole blood and one purified monocyte data set (in total, 991/924 females/males). We used double generalized linear models to detect age-related differentially methylated CpGs (aDMCs), whose mean methylation level differs with age, and age-related variably methylated CpGs (aVMCs), whose methylation level becomes more variable with age.In females, aDMCs were relatively uncommon (n = 33) and preferentially occurred in regions known to escape XCI. In contrast, many CpGs (n = 987) were found to display an increased variance with age (aVMCs). Of note, the replication rate of aVMCs was also high in purified monocytes (94%), indicating an independence of cell composition. aVMCs accumulated in CpG islands and regions subject to XCI suggesting that they stemmed from the inactive X. In males, carrying an active copy of the X chromosome only, aDMCs (n = 316) were primarily driven by cell composition, while aVMCs replicated well (95%) but were infrequent (n = 37).Our results imply that age-related DNA methylation differences at the inactive X chromosome are dominated by the accumulation of variability.© 2023.

"37666817","Biological differences underlying sex and gender disparities in bladder cancer: current synopsis and future directions.","Oncogenesis","Sex and gender disparities in bladder cancer have long been a subject of interest to the cancer research community, wherein men have a 4 times higher incidence rate than women, and female patients often present with higher-grade disease and experience worse outcomes. Despite the known differences in disease incidence and clinical outcomes between male and female bladder cancer patients, clinical management remains the same. In this review, we critically analyze studies that report on the biological differences between men and women and evaluate how these differences contribute to sex and gender disparities in bladder cancer. Distinct characteristics of the male and female immune systems, differences in circulating hormone levels and hormone receptor expression, and different genetic and epigenetic alterations are major biological factors that all likely contribute to disparate incidence rates and outcomes for male and female bladder cancer patients. Future preclinical and clinical studies in this area should employ experimental approaches that account for and consider sex and gender disparities in bladder cancer, thereby facilitating the development of precision medicine for the effective treatment of bladder cancer in all patients.© 2023.

Using genetic variation as an instrumental variable for vegetable intake and socioeconomic status, we investigated the relationship between vegetable intake and ischemic cardio-cerebral vascular diseases and focused on whether socioeconomic status was a possible confounder.From three independent genome-wide association studies, we extracted instrumental variables reflecting raw and cooked vegetable intake, which were used to perform Mendelian randomization analysis. To evaluate the effects of socioeconomic factors on vegetable intake, univariate and multivariate Mendelian randomization analyses were performed using single nucleotide polymorphisms representing education attainment and household income reported in the literature. We also performed outlier assessment and a series of sensitivity analyses to confirm the results.Genetically predicted raw and cooked vegetable intake were not associated with any ischemic cardio-cerebral vascular diseases and lipid components after Bonferroni correction. Univariate Mendelian randomized analysis revealed that raw vegetable intake was positively correlated with education attainment (β = 0.04,p = 0.029) and household income (β = 0.07,p < 0.001). Multivariate Mendelian randomized model showed a positive correlation between household income and raw vegetable intake (β = 0.06,p = 0.004). Socioeconomic status was closely associated with eating habits and lifestyle related to the risk of cardiovascular diseases.Genetically determined raw and cooked vegetable intake was not associated with significant benefits in terms of ischemic cardio-cerebral vascular diseases while genetically determined socioeconomic status may have an impact on vegetable intake. Socioeconomic status, which was closely associated with other eating habits and lifestyle, may affect the association between vegetable intake and ischemic cardio-cerebral vascular diseases.Copyright © 2023 Huang, He, Xu, Du and Zhao."
"37564429","Exploring the bidirectional causal link between household income status and genetic susceptibility to neurological diseases: findings from a Mendelian randomization study.","Front Public Health","Observational studies have revealed that socioeconomic status is associated with neurological disorders and aging. However, the potential causal effect between the two remains unclear. We therefore aimed to investigate the causal relationship between household income status and genetic susceptibility to neurological diseases using a bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) study.An MR study was conducted on a large-sample cohort of the European population pulled from a publicly available genome-wide association study dataset, using a random-effects inverse-variance weighting model as the main standard. MR-Egger regression, weighted median, and maximum likelihood estimation were also performed concurrently as supplements. A sensitivity analysis, consisting of a heterogeneity test and horizontal pleiotropy test, was performed using Cochran's Q, MR-Egger intercept, and MR-PRESSO tests to ensure the reliability of the conclusion.The results suggested that higher household income tended to lower the risk of genetic susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease (odds ratio [OR]: 0.740, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.559-0.980,p-value = 0.036) and ischemic stroke (OR: 0.801, 95% CI = 0.662-0.968,p-value = 0.022). By contrast, higher household income tended to increase the risk of genetic susceptibility to Parkinson's disease (OR: 2.605, 95% CI = 1.413-4.802,p-value = 0.002). No associations were evident for intracranial hemorrhage (OR: 1.002, 95% CI = 0.607-1.653,p-value = 0.993), cerebral aneurysm (OR: 0.597, 95% CI = 0.243-1.465,p-value = 0.260), subarachnoid hemorrhage (OR: 1.474, 95% CI = 0.699-3.110,p-value = 0.308), or epilepsy (OR: 1.029, 95% CI = 0.662-1.600,p-value = 0.899). The reverse MR study suggested no reverse causal relationship between neurological disorders and household income status. A sensitivity analysis verified the reliability of the results.Our results revealed that the populations with a superior household income exhibit an increased predisposition of genetic susceptibility to Parkinson's Disease, while demonstrating a potential decreased genetic susceptibility to ischemic stroke and Alzheimer's disease.Copyright © 2023 Nong, Mo and Luo."
"37596607","Association between acetaminophen metabolites and CYP2E1 DNA methylation level in neonate cord blood in the Boston Birth Cohort.","Clin Epigenetics","Acetaminophen is a commonly used medication by pregnant women and is known to cross the placenta. However, little is known about the biological mechanisms that regulate acetaminophen in the developing offspring. Cytochrome 2E1 (CYP2E1) is the primary enzyme responsible for the conversion of acetaminophen to its toxic metabolite. Ex vivo studies have shown that the CYP2E1 gene expression in human fetal liver and placenta is largely controlled by DNA methylation (DNAm) at CpG sites located in the gene body of CYP2E1 at the 5' end. To date, no population studies have examined the association between acetaminophen metabolite and fetal DNAm of CYP2E1 at birth.We utilized data from the Boston Birth Cohort (BBC) which represents an urban, low-income, racially and ethnically diverse population in Boston, Massachusetts. Acetaminophen metabolites were measured in the cord plasma of newborns enrolled in BBC between 2003 and 2013 using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. DNAm at 28 CpG sites of CYP2E1 was measured by Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. We used linear regression to identify differentially methylated CpG sites and the ""DiffVar"" method to identify differences in methylation variation associated with the detection of acetaminophen, adjusting for cell heterogeneity and batch effects. The false discovery rate (FDR) was calculated to account for multiple comparisons.Among the 570 newborns included in this study, 96 (17%) had detectable acetaminophen in cord plasma. We identified 7 differentially methylated CpGs (FDR < 0.05) associated with the detection of acetaminophen and additional 4 CpGs showing a difference in the variation of methylation (FDR < 0.05). These CpGs were all located in the gene body of CYP2E1 at the 5' end and had a 3-6% lower average methylation level among participants with detectable acetaminophen compared to participants without. The CpG sites we identified overlap with previously identified DNase hypersensitivity and open chromatin regions in the ENCODE project, suggesting potential regulatory functions.In a US birth cohort, we found detection of cord biomarkers of acetaminophen was associated with DNAm level of CYP2E1 in cord blood. Our findings suggest that DNA methylation of CYP2E1 may be an important regulator of acetaminophen levels in newborns.© 2023. BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature."
"37582831","REPTOR and CREBRF encode key regulators of muscle energy metabolism.","Nat Commun","Metabolic flexibility of muscle tissue describes the adaptive capacity to use different energy substrates according to their availability. The disruption of this ability associates with metabolic disease. Here, using a Drosophila model of systemic metabolic dysfunction triggered by yorkie-induced gut tumors, we show that the transcription factor REPTOR is an important regulator of energy metabolism in muscles. We present evidence that REPTOR is activated in muscles of adult flies with gut yorkie-tumors, where it modulates glucose metabolism. Further, in vivo studies indicate that sustained activity of REPTOR is sufficient in wildtype muscles to repress glycolysis and increase tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolites. Consistent with the fly studies, higher levels of CREBRF, the mammalian ortholog of REPTOR, reduce glycolysis in mouse myotubes while promoting oxidative metabolism. Altogether, our results define a conserved function for REPTOR and CREBRF as key regulators of muscle energy metabolism.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."
"37653005",NA,NA,"In most eukaryotes and prokaryotes TGA is used at a significantly higher frequency than TAG as termination codon of protein-coding genes. Although this phenomenon has been recognized several years ago, there is no generally accepted explanation for the TAG-TGA paradox. Our analyses of human mutation data revealed that out of the eighteen sense codons that can give rise to a nonsense codon by single base substitution, the CGA codon is exceptional: it gives rise to the TGA stop codon at an order of magnitude higher rate than the other codons. Here we propose that the TAG-TGA paradox is due to methylation and hypermutabilty of CpG dinucleotides. In harmony with this explanation, we show that the coding genomes of organisms with strong CpG methylation have a significant bias for TGA whereas those from organisms that lack CpG methylation use TGA and TAG termination codons with similar probability.© 2023.

Cattle that graze on bracken fern also develop UC, associated with exposure to the carcinogen ptaquiloside. These species may represent relevant animal models of spontaneous and carcinogen-induced UC that can provide insight into human MIBC.Whole-exome sequencing of domestic canine (n = 87) and feline (n = 23) UC, and comparative analysis with human MIBC reveals a lower mutation rate in animal cases and the absence of APOBEC mutational signatures. A convergence of driver genes (ARID1A, KDM6A, TP53, FAT1, and NRAS) is discovered, along with common focally amplified and deleted genes involved in regulation of the cell cycle and chromatin remodelling. We identify mismatch repair deficiency in a subset of canine and feline UCs with biallelic inactivation of MSH2. Bovine UC (n = 8) is distinctly different; we identify novel mutational signatures which are recapitulated in vitro in human urinary bladder UC cells treated with bracken fern extracts or purified ptaquiloside.Canine and feline urinary bladder UC represent relevant models of MIBC in humans, and cross-species analysis can identify evolutionarily conserved driver genes.

Prior studies have demonstrated that examining patterns of somatic mutations can be leveraged to provide both biological and clinical insights, thus, resulting in an extensive repertoire of tools for evaluating small mutational events. Recently, classification schemas for examining large-scale mutational events have emerged and shown their utility across the spectrum of human cancers.

Normal tissues accumulate mutations at varying rates ranging from 11 per cell per year in the liver, to 1879 per cell per year in the bladder. In addition, some normal tissues are also comprised of a large proportion of cells which possess driver mutations while appearing phenotypically normal, as in the oesophagus where a majority of cells harbour driver mutations. Individual tissue proliferation and mutation rate, unique mutagenic stimuli, and local tissue architecture contribute to this highly variegated landscape which confounds the functional characterization of driver mutations found in normal tissue. In particular, our understanding of the relationship between normal tissue somatic mutations and tumour initiation or future cancer risk remains poor. Here, we describe the mutational signatures and somatic driver mutations in solid and hollow viscus organs, highlighting unique characteristics in a tissue-specific manner, while simultaneously seeking to describe commonalities which can bring forward a basic unified theory on the role of these driver mutations in tumour initiation.

The majority of patients are older than 65 years and the global burden of this disease is increasing due to the aging of the population. The disease is usually diagnosed at advanced stages, which is a consequence of nonspecific symptoms. Few improvements have been made at the level of noninvasive molecular diagnosis of sporadic gastric cancer, and therefore the mortality rate remains high. A new field of mutational signatures has emerged in the past decade with advances in the genome sequencing technology. These distinct mutational patterns in the genome, caused by exogenous and endogenous mutational processes, can be associated with tumour aetiology and disease progression, and could provide novel perception on the treatment possibilities. This review assesses the mutational signatures found in gastric cancer and summarises their potential for use in clinical setting as diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers.

Here, we focused on gluconate as a clinically licensed small-molecule inducer and engineered gluconate-sensitive molecular switches to regulate transgene expression in human cell cultures and in mice. Several switch designs were assembled based on the gluconate-responsive transcriptional repressor GntR from Escherichia coli. Initially we assembled OFF- and ON-type switches by rewiring the native gluconate-dependent binding of GntR to target DNA sequences in mammalian cells. Then, we utilized the ability of GntR to dimerize in the presence of gluconate to activate gene expression from a split transcriptional activator. By means of random mutagenesis of GntR combined with phenotypic screening, we identified variants that significantly enhanced the functionality of the genetic devices, enabling the construction of robust two-input logic gates. We also demonstrated the potential utility of the synthetic switch in two in vivo settings, one employing implantation of alginate-encapsulated engineered cells and the other involving modification of host cells by DNA delivery. Then, as proof-of-concept, the gluconate-actuated genetic switch was connected to insulin secretion, and the components encoding gluconate-induced insulin production were introduced into type-1 diabetic mice as naked DNA via hydrodynamic tail vein injection. Normoglycemia was restored, thereby showcasing the suitability of oral gluconate to regulate in situ production of a therapeutic protein.© The Author(s) 2023.

"37626570",NA,NA,"The impact of different meditation protocols on human health is explored at the cognitive and cellular levels. Preksha Dhyana meditation has been observed to seemingly affect the cognitive performance, transcriptome, and methylome of healthy and novice participant practitioners. In this study, we performed correlation analyses to investigate the presence of any relationships in the changes in cognitive performance and DNA methylation in a group of college students practicing Preksha Dhyāna (N = 34). Nine factors of cognitive performance were assessed at baseline and 8 weeks postintervention timepoints in the participants. Statistically significant improvements were observed in six of the nine assessments, which were predominantly relating to memory and affect. Using Illumina 850 K microarray technology, 470 differentially methylated sites (DMS) were identified between the two timepoints (baseline and 8 weeks), using a threshold ofp-value < 0.05 and methylation levels beyond -3% to 3% at every site. Correlation analysis between the changes in performance on each of the nine assessments and every DMS unveiled statistically significant positive and negative relationships at several of these sites. The identified DMS were in proximity of essential genes involved in signaling and other important metabolic processes. Interestingly, we identified a set of sites that can be considered as biomarkers for Preksha meditation improvements at the genome level."

However, current studies have found a limited number of SpA-related genes, and the genetic and pathogenic mechanisms of SpA are still unclear.A tissue-specific transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) of SpA was performed using GWAS (including 3966 SpA patients and 448,298 controls) summary data and gene expression weights of whole blood and skeletal muscle. The SpA-associated genes identified by TWAS were further compared with the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified in the SpA gene expression profile acquired from the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO, GSE58667). Finally, functional enrichment and annotation analyses of the identified genes were performed.The TWAS detected 499 suggestive genes associated with SpA in whole blood and skeletal muscle, such as CTNNAL1 (PSM = 3.04 × 10-2, PWB = 9.58 × 10-3). The gene expression profile of SpA identified 20 candidate genes that overlapped in the TWAS data, such as MCM4 (PTWAS = 1.32 × 10-2, PDEG = 2.75 × 10-2) and KIAA1109 (PTWAS = 3.71 × 10-2, PDEG = 4.67 × 10-2). Enrichment analysis of the genes identified by TWAS identified 93 significant GO terms and 33 KEGG pathways, such as mitochondrion organization (GO: 0007005) and axon guidance (hsa04360).We identified multiple candidate genes that were genetically related to SpA.

Here, we investigated the influence of biological sex on protein expression and its genetic regulation in 1,277 human brain proteomes. We found that 13.2% (1,354) of brain proteins had sex-differentiated abundance and 1.5% (150) of proteins had sex-biased protein quantitative trait loci (sb-pQTLs). Among genes with sex-biased expression, we found 67% concordance between sex-differentiated protein and transcript levels; however, sex effects on the genetic regulation of expression were more evident at the protein level. Considering 24 psychiatric, neurologic and brain morphologic traits, we found that an average of 25% of their putatively causal genes had sex-differentiated protein abundance and 12 putatively causal proteins had sb-pQTLs. Furthermore, integrating sex-specific pQTLs with sex-stratified genome-wide association studies of six psychiatric and neurologic conditions, we uncovered another 23 proteins contributing to these traits in one sex but not the other. Together, these findings begin to provide insights into mechanisms underlying sex differences in brain protein expression and disease.© 2023.

In this study, we conducted a two-stage proteome-wide association study (PWAS) using ALS genome-wide association study (GWAS) data (N = 152,268) and two distinct human brain protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) datasets (ROSMAP N = 376 and Banner N = 152) to identify ALS risk genes and prioritized candidate genes with Mendelian randomization (MR) and Bayesian colocalization analysis. Next, we verified the aberrant expression of risk genes in multiple tissues, including lower motor neurons, skeletal muscle, and whole blood. Six ALS risk genes (SCFD1, SARM1, TMEM175, BCS1L, WIPI2, and DHRS11) were found during the PWAS discovery phase, and SARM1 and BCS1L were confirmed during the validation phase. The following MR (p = 2.10 × 10-7) and Bayesian colocalization analysis (ROSMAP PP4 = 0.999, Banner PP4 = 0.999) confirmed the causal association between SARM1 and ALS. Further differential expression analysis revealed that SARM1 was markedly downregulated in lower motor neurons (p = 7.64 × 10-3), skeletal muscle (p = 9.34 × 10-3), and whole blood (p = 1.94 × 10-3). Our findings identified some promising protein candidates for future investigation as therapeutic targets.

"37620670","Deciphering the genetic landscape of obesity: a data-driven approach to identifying plausible causal genes and therapeutic targets.","J Hum Genet","Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully revealed numerous susceptibility loci for obesity. However, identifying the causal genes, pathways, and tissues/cell types responsible for these associations remains a challenge, and standardized analysis workflows are lacking. Additionally, due to limited treatment options for obesity, there is a need for the development of new pharmacological therapies. This study aimed to address these issues by performing step-wise utilization of knowledgebase for gene prioritization and assessing the potential relevance of key obesity genes as therapeutic targets.First, we generated a list of 28,787 obesity-associated SNPs from the publicly available GWAS dataset (approximately 800,000 individuals in the GIANT meta-analysis). Then, we prioritized 1372 genes with significant in silico evidence against genomic and transcriptomic data, including transcriptionally regulated genes in the brain from transcriptome-wide association studies. In further narrowing down the gene list, we selected key genes, which we found to be useful for the discovery of potential drug seeds as demonstrated in lipid GWAS separately. We thus identified 74 key genes for obesity, which are highly interconnected and enriched in several biological processes that contribute to obesity, including energy expenditure and homeostasis. Of 74 key genes, 37 had not been reported for the pathophysiology of obesity. Finally, by drug-gene interaction analysis, we detected 23 (of 74) key genes that are potential targets for 78 approved and marketed drugs.Our results provide valuable insights into new treatment options for obesity through a data-driven approach that integrates multiple up-to-date knowledgebases.© 2023.

We employed an integrative pipeline to efficiently transform genetic associations to identify causal genes for migraine.We conducted a proteome-wide association study (PWAS) by combining data from the migraine GWAS data with proteomic data from the human brain and plasma to identify proteins that may play a role in the risk of developing migraine. We also combined data from GWAS of migraine with a novel joint-tissue imputation (JTI) prediction model of 17 migraine-related human tissues to conduct transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) together with the fine mapping method FOCUS to identify disease-associated genes.We identified 13 genes in the human brain and plasma proteome that modulate migraine risk by regulating protein abundance. In addition, 62 associated genes not reported in previous migraine TWAS studies were identified by our analysis of migraine using TWAS and fine mapping. Five genes including ICA1L, TREX1, STAT6, UFL1, and B3GNT8 showed significant associations with migraine at both the proteome and transcriptome, these genes are mainly expressed in ependymal cells, neurons, and glial cells, and are potential target genes for prevention of neuronal signaling and inflammatory responses in the pathogenesis of migraine.Our proteomic and transcriptome findings have identified disease-associated genes that may give new insights into the pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets for migraine.© 2023.

Here, using a tree peony (Paeonia suffruticosaAndrews, Paeoniaceae) cultivar population as a model, the phenotypic polymorphism and genetic variation based on genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis were analyzed. Based on 24 phenotypic traits of 271 representative cultivars, the transcript profiles of 119 cultivars were obtained, which indicated abundant genetic variation in tree peony. In total, 86 GWAS-relatedcis-eQTLs and 3188trans-eQTL gene pairs were found to be associated with the numbers of petals, stamens, and carpels. In addition, 19 floral organ number-related hub genes with 121cis-eQTLs were obtained by weighted gene co-expression network analysis, among which five hub genes belonging to the ABCE genes of the MADS-box family and their spatial-temporal co-expression and regulatory network were constructed. These results not only help our understanding of the genetic basis of floral organ number variation during domestication, but also pave the way to studying the quantitative genetics and evolution of flower organ number and their regulatory network within populations.© The Author(s) 2023.

Plasma Neuronatin was measured by ELISA in (1) 79 subjects of five BMI categories (AN/BMI < 17.5 kg/m2; normal weight/BMI 18.5-25 kg/m2; obesity/BMI 30-40 kg/m2; obesity/BMI 40-50 kg/m2; obesity/BMI > 50 kg/m2) with assessment of BC (bioimpedance analysis; BIA); (2) 49 women with AN (BMI 14.5 ± 1.8 kg/m2) with measurements of BC (BIA) and PA (accelerometry); (3) 79 women with obesity (BMI 48.8 ± 7.8 kg/m2) with measurements of anxiety (GAD-7), stress (PSQ-20), depression (PHQ-9) and eating behavior (EDI-2). Overall, a positive correlation was found between Neuronatin and BMI (p= 0.006) as well as total fat mass (FM;p= 0.036). In AN, Neuronatin did not correlate with BMI, FM, or PA (p> 0.05); no correlations were found between Neuronatin and psychometric outcomes in obesity (p> 0.05). The findings suggest an FM-dependent peripheral Neuronatin expression. The decreased Neuronatin expression in AN provides evidence that Neuronatin is implicated in the pathogenesis of eating disorders."

However, ADHD PGSs are typically correlated with ADHD but not necessarily reflective of causal mechanisms. More research is needed to elucidate the neurobiological mechanisms underlying ADHD. We leveraged functional annotation information into an ADHD PGS to (1) improve the prediction performance over a non-annotated ADHD PGS and (2) test whether volumetric variation in brain regions putatively associated with ADHD mediate the association between PGSs and ADHD outcomes.Data were from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (N = 555). Multiple mediation models were tested to examine the indirect effects of two ADHD PGSs-one using a traditional computation involving clumping and thresholding and another using a functionally annotated approach (i.e., AnnoPred)-on ADHD inattention (IA) and hyperactivity-impulsivity (HI) symptoms, via gray matter volumes in the cingulate gyrus, angular gyrus, caudate, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and inferior temporal lobe.A direct effect was detected between the AnnoPred ADHD PGS and IA symptoms in adolescents. No indirect effects via brain volumes were detected for either IA or HI symptoms. However, both ADHD PGSs were negatively associated with the DLPFC.The AnnoPred ADHD PGS was a more developmentally specific predictor of adolescent IA symptoms compared to the traditional ADHD PGS. However, brain volumes did not mediate the effects of either a traditional or AnnoPred ADHD PGS on ADHD symptoms, suggesting that we may still be underpowered in clarifying brain-based biomarkers for ADHD using genetic measures.© 2023.

"37612283","Androgen receptor binding sites enabling genetic prediction of mortality due to prostate cancer in cancer-free subjects.","Nat Commun","Prostate cancer (PrCa) is the second most common cancer worldwide in males. While strongly warranted, the prediction of mortality risk due to PrCa, especially before its development, is challenging. Here, we address this issue by maximizing the statistical power of genetic data with multi-ancestry meta-analysis and focusing on binding sites of the androgen receptor (AR), which has a critical role in PrCa. Taking advantage of large Japanese samples ever, a multi-ancestry meta-analysis comprising more than 300,000 subjects in total identifies 9 unreported loci including ZFHX3, a tumor suppressor gene, and successfully narrows down the statistically finemapped variants compared to European-only studies, and these variants strongly enrich in AR binding sites. A polygenic risk scores (PRS) analysis restricting to statistically finemapped variants in AR binding sites shows among cancer-free subjects, individuals with a PRS in the top 10% have a strongly higher risk of the future death of PrCa (HR: 5.57, P = 4.2 × 10-10). Our findings demonstrate the potential utility of leveraging large-scale genetic data and advanced analytical methods in predicting the mortality of PrCa.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."

Many patients exhibit elevated plasma CyC levels, particularly during glucocorticoid (GC) treatment. This study links GCs with CyC's systemic regulation by utilizing genome-wide association and structural equation modeling to determine CyC production genetics in the UK Biobank. Both CyC production and a polygenic score (PGS) capturing predisposition to CyC production were associated with increased all-cause and cancer-specific mortality. We found that the GC receptor directly targets CyC, leading to GC-responsive CyC secretion in macrophages and cancer cells. CyC-knockout tumors displayed significantly reduced growth and diminished recruitment of TREM2+ macrophages, which have been connected to cancer immunotherapy failure. Furthermore, the CyC-production PGS predicted checkpoint immunotherapy failure in 685 patients with metastatic cancer from combined clinical trial cohorts. In conclusion, CyC may act as a GC effector pathway via TREM2+ macrophage recruitment and may be a potential target for combination cancer immunotherapy.© 2023."

We developed a combined experimental and analytical approach that integrates single cell epigenomics with GWAS to prioritize risk variants and genes. We profiled accessible chromatin in single cells obtained from human hearts and leveraged the data to study genetics of Atrial Fibrillation (AF), the most common cardiac arrhythmia. Enrichment analysis of AF risk variants using cell-type-resolved open chromatin regions (OCRs) implicated cardiomyocytes as the main mediator of AF risk. We then performed statistical fine-mapping, leveraging the information in OCRs, and identified putative causal variants in 122 AF-associated loci. Taking advantage of the fine-mapping results, our novel statistical procedure for gene discovery prioritized 46 high-confidence risk genes, highlighting transcription factors and signal transduction pathways important for heart development.

Here we developed a workflow using ESM1b, a 650-million-parameter protein language model, to predict all ~450 million possible missense variant effects in the human genome, and made all predictions available on a web portal. ESM1b outperformed existing methods in classifying ~150,000 ClinVar/HGMD missense variants as pathogenic or benign and predicting measurements across 28 deep mutational scan datasets. We further annotated ~2 million variants as damaging only in specific protein isoforms, demonstrating the importance of considering all isoforms when predicting variant effects. Our approach also generalizes to more complex coding variants such as in-frame indels and stop-gains. Together, these results establish protein language models as an effective, accurate and general approach to predicting variant effects.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Here, we utilized an adapted STARR-seq to evaluate the regulatory activities of 5,987 noncoding SNPs associated with IR-relevant phenotypes. We identified 876 SNPs with biased allelic enhancer activity effects (baaSNPs) across 133 loci in three IR-relevant cell lines (HepG2, preadipocyte, and A673), which showed pervasive cell specificity and significant enrichment for cell-specific open chromatin regions or enhancer-indicative markers (H3K4me1, H3K27ac). Further functional characterization suggested several transcription factors (TFs) with preferential allelic binding to baaSNPs. We also incorporated multi-omics data to prioritize 102 candidate regulatory target genes for baaSNPs and revealed prevalent long-range regulatory effects and cell-specific IR-relevant biological functional enrichment on them. Specifically, we experimentally verified the distal regulatory mechanism at IRS1 locus, in which rs952227-A reinforces IRS1 expression by long-range chromatin interaction and preferential binding to the transcription factor HOXC6 to augment the enhancer activity. Finally, based on our STARR-seq screening data, we predicted the enhancer activity of 227,343 noncoding SNPs associated with IR-relevant phenotypes (fasting insulin adjusted for BMI, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides) from the largest available GWAS summary statistics.

"37477662","Functional Enrichment Analysis Identifying Regulatory Information Associated with Human Fracture.","Calcif Tissue Int","Dozens of loci associated with fracture have been identified by genome-wide association studies (GWASs). However, most of these variants are located in the noncoding regions including introns, long terminal repeats, and intergenic regions. Although combining regulation information helps to identify the causal SNPs and interpret the involvement of these variants in the etiology of human fracture, regulation information which was truly associated with fracture was unknown. A novel functional enrichment method GARFIELD (GWAS Analysis of Regulatory of Functional Information Enrichment with LD correction) was applied to identify fracture-associated regulation information, including transcript factor binding sites, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), chromatin states, enhancer, promoter, dyadic, super enhancer and Epigenome marks. Fracture SNPs were significantly enriched in exon (Bonferroni correction, p value < 7.14 × 10-3) at two GWAS p value thresholds through GARFIELD. High level of fold-enrichment was observed in super enhancer of monocyte and the enhancer of chondrocyte (Bonferroni correction, p value < 4.45 × 10-3). eQTLs of 44 tissues/cells and 10 transcription factors (TFs) were identified to be associated with human fracture. These results provide new insight into the etiology of human fracture, which might increase the identification of the causal SNPs through the fine-mapping study combined with functional annotation, as well as polygenic risk score.© 2023.

Fine-mapping in multi-ancestry populations should improve the efficiency of prioritizing variants for functional interrogation. To evaluate this hypothesis, we leveraged ancestry architecture to perform comparative GWAS and fine-mapping of obesity-related phenotypes in European ancestry populations from the UK Biobank (UKBB) and multi-ancestry samples from the Population Architecture for Genetic Epidemiology (PAGE) consortium with comparable sample sizes. In the investigated regions with genome-wide significant associations for obesity-related traits, fine-mapping in our ancestrally diverse sample led to 95% and 99% credible sets (CS) with fewer variants than in the European ancestry sample. Lead fine-mapped variants in PAGE regions had higher average coding scores, and higher average posterior probabilities for causality compared to UKBB. Importantly, 99% CS in PAGE loci contained strong expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in adipose tissues or harbored more variants in tighter linkage disequilibrium (LD) with eQTLs. Leveraging ancestrally diverse populations with heterogeneous ancestry architectures, coupled with functional annotation, increased fine-mapping efficiency and performance, and reduced the set of candidate variants for consideration for future functional studies. Significant overlap in genetic causal variants across populations suggests generalizability of genetic mechanisms underpinning obesity-related traits across populations.© 2023.

"37569198",NA,NA,"Given the availability of molecular tools, population studies increasingly include the gen-diet interactions in their considerations. The use of these interactions allows for the obtaining of more uniform research groups. In practice, this translates into the possibility of reducing the size of the research group while maintaining the precision of the research. The research results obtained in this way can be used to select certain ingredients and foods in a dietary intervention with a higher degree of personalisation. In both prophylaxis and dietary therapy of overweight and obesity, the proper selection of bioactive ingredients best suited to the given group of consumers is of key importance. Hence, the aim of the presented study was to assess the effectiveness of a dietary intervention with the use of lactoferrin (LF)-fortified yoghurt, in terms of the ability to regulate body weight and carbohydrate metabolism in individuals whose genomes contained single nucleotide polymorphisms that predisposed them to increased accumulation of fatty tissue and consequently overweight or obesity. A group of 137 participants (98 women and 37 men) of Polish origin were screened for the presence of four single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs993960-FTO gene, rs7903146-TCF7L2 gene, rs10830963-MTNR1B gene, and rs1121980-FTO gene). Subsequently, a group of 19 participants diagnosed with the presence of risk factors within said SNPs underwent a 21-day dietary intervention (crossover study) with the use of yoghurt fortified with lactoferrin (200 mg/day). The results of the study revealed a genetic difference between the Polish population and the European average, in terms of the SNPs analysed. The dietary intervention showed a statistically significantly higher efficiency in terms of body mass reduction (p= 0.000) and lowering the glycated haemoglobin ratio (HbA1c) (p= 0.000) when consuming specially prepared yoghurt containing lactoferrin, as compared to results registered for unfortified yoghurt. Given the above, yoghurt fortified with LF should be considered as a viable element of diet therapy in overweight and obese patients diagnosed with risk factors within the analysed polymorphisms."

We investigated the shared genetic architecture of AN and schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BIP), major depression (MD), mood instability (Mood), neuroticism (NEUR), and intelligence (INT). We applied the conditional false discovery rate (FDR) method to identify novel risk loci for AN, and conjunctional FDR to identify loci shared between AN and related phenotypes, to summarize statistics from relevant genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Individual GWAS samples varied from 72,517 to 420,879 participants. Using conditional FDR we identified 58 novel AN loci. Furthermore, we identified 38 unique loci shared between AN and major psychiatric disorders (SCZ, BIP, and MD) and 45 between AN and psychological traits (Mood, NEUR, and INT). In line with genetic correlations, the majority of shared loci showed concordant effect directions. Functional analyses revealed that the shared loci are involved in 65 unique pathways, several of which overlapped across analyses, including the ""signal by MST1"" pathway involved in Hippo signaling. In conclusion, we demonstrated genetic overlap between AN and major psychiatric disorders and related traits, and identified novel risk loci for AN by leveraging this overlap. Our results indicate that some shared characteristics between AN and related disorders and traits may have genetic underpinnings.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."

A genome-wide cross-trait design was performed to quantify global and local genetic correlation, identify pleiotropic loci, and infer a causal relationship.Among the overall population, a significant global genetic correlation was observed for SHBGadjBMI and RA ([Formula: see text] = 0.11, P = 1.0 × 10-4) which was further supported by local signal (1q25.2). A total of 18 independent pleiotropic SNPs were identified, of which three were highly likely causal variants and four were found to have effects on both traits through gene expression mediation. A putative causal association of SHBGadjBMI on RA was demonstrated (OR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.01-1.43) without evidence of reverse causality (OR = 0.999, 95% CI = 0.997-1.000). Sex-specific analyses revealed distinct shared genetic regions (men: 1q32.1-q32.2 and 5p13.1; women: 1q25.2 and 22q11.21-q11.22) and diverse pleiotropic SNPs (16 in men and 18 in women, nearly half were sex-specific) underlying SHBGadjBMI and RA, demonstrating biological disparities between sexes. Replacing SHBGadjBMI with crude SHBG, a largely similar yet less significant pattern of results was observed.Our cross-trait analysis suggests an intrinsic, as well as a sex-specific, link underlying SHBG and RA, providing novel insights into disease etiology.© 2023.

"37604895","Deep learning based phenotyping of medical images improves power for gene discovery of complex disease.","NPJ Digit Med","Electronic health records are often incomplete, reducing the power of genetic association studies. For some diseases, such as knee osteoarthritis where the routine course of diagnosis involves an X-ray, image-based phenotyping offers an alternate and unbiased way to ascertain disease cases. We investigated this by training a deep-learning model to ascertain knee osteoarthritis cases from knee DXA scans that achieved clinician-level performance. Using our model, we identified 1931 (178%) more cases than currently diagnosed in the health record. Individuals diagnosed as cases by our model had higher rates of self-reported knee pain, for longer durations and with increased severity compared to control individuals. We trained another deep-learning model to measure the knee joint space width, a quantitative phenotype linked to knee osteoarthritis severity. In performing genetic association analysis, we found that use of a quantitative measure improved the number of genome-wide significant loci we discovered by an order of magnitude compared with our binary model of cases and controls despite the two phenotypes being highly genetically correlated. In addition we discovered associations between our quantitative measure of knee osteoarthritis and increased risk of adult fractures- a leading cause of injury-related death in older individuals-, illustrating the capability of image-based phenotyping to reveal epidemiological associations not captured in the electronic health record. For diseases with radiographic diagnosis, our results demonstrate the potential for using deep learning to phenotype at biobank scale, improving power for both genetic and epidemiological association analysis.© 2023.

"37601970",NA,NA,"Obesity contributes substantially to the global burden of disease and has a significant heritable component. Recent large-scale exome sequencing studies identified several genes in which rare, protein-coding variants have large effects on adult body mass index (BMI). Here we extended such work by performing sex-stratified associations in the UK Biobank study (N∼420,000). We identified genes in which rare heterozygous loss-of-function increases adult BMI in women (DIDO1, PTPRG,andSLC12A5) and in men (SLTM), with effect sizes up to ∼8 kg/m2. This is complemented by analyses implicating rare variants inOBSCNandMADDfor recalled childhood adiposity. The known functions of these genes, as well as findings of common variant genome-wide pathway enrichment analyses, suggest a role for neuron death, apoptosis, and DNA damage response mechanisms in the susceptibility to obesity across the life-course. These findings highlight the importance of considering sex-specific and life-course effects in the genetic regulation of obesity.© 2023 The Authors."
"37596344","Genetic associations between alcohol phenotypes and life satisfaction: a genomic structural equation modelling approach.","Sci Rep","Alcohol use (i.e., quantity, frequency) and alcohol use disorder (AUD) are common, associated with adverse outcomes, and genetically-influenced. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified genetic loci associated with both. AUD is positively genetically associated with psychopathology, while alcohol use (e.g., drinks per week) is negatively associated or NS related to psychopathology. We wanted to test if these genetic associations extended to life satisfaction, as there is an interest in understanding the associations between psychopathology-related traits and constructs that are not just the absence of psychopathology, but positive outcomes (e.g., well-being variables). Thus, we used Genomic Structural Equation Modeling (gSEM) to analyze summary-level genomic data (i.e., effects of genetic variants on constructs of interest) from large-scale GWAS of European ancestry individuals. Results suggest that the best-fitting model is a Bifactor Model, in which unique alcohol use, unique AUD, and common alcohol factors are extracted. The genetic correlation (rg) between life satisfaction-AUD specific factor was near zero, the rgwith the alcohol use specific factor was positive and significant, and the rgwith the common alcohol factor was negative and significant. Findings indicate that life satisfaction shares genetic etiology with typical alcohol use and life dissatisfaction shares genetic etiology with heavy alcohol use.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."

Quantitative variation in these structures has not been subjected previously to large-scale genetic analysis. We perform genome-wide association studies of 63 flow-cytometry derived cellular phenotypes-including cell-type specific measures of granularity, nucleic acid content and reactivity-in 41,515 participants in the INTERVAL study. We identify 2172 distinct variant-trait associations, including associations near genes coding for proteins in organelles implicated in inflammatory and thrombotic diseases. By integrating with epigenetic data we show that many intracellular structures are likely to be determined in immature precursor cells. By integrating with proteomic data we identify the transcription factor FOG2 as an early regulator of platelet formation and α-granularity. Finally, we show that colocalisation of our associations with disease risk signals can suggest aetiological cell-types-variants in IL2RA and ITGA4 respectively mirror the known effects of daclizumab in multiple sclerosis and vedolizumab in inflammatory bowel disease.© 2023.

Approximately 20% of DR patients have diabetic macular edema (DME) characterized by fluid leakage into the retina. There is a genetic component to DR and DME risk, but few replicable loci. Because not all DR cases have DME, we focused on DME to increase power, and conducted a multi-ancestry GWAS to assess DME risk in a total of 1,502 DME patients and 5,603 non-DME controls in discovery and replication datasets. Two loci reached GWAS significance (p<5x10-8). The strongest association was rs2239785, (K150E) in APOL1. The second finding was rs10402468, which co-localized to PLVAP and ANKLE1 in vascular / endothelium tissues. We conducted multiple sensitivity analyses to establish that the associations were specific to DME status and did not reflect diabetes status or other diabetic complications. Here we report two novel loci for risk of DME which replicated in multiple clinical trial and biobank derived datasets. One of these loci, containing the gene APOL1, is a risk factor in African American DME and DKD patients, indicating that this locus plays a broader role in diabetic complications for multiple ancestries.

The genetic correlation is a well-known means of quantifying and testing for genetic similarity between traits, but its estimates are subject to comparatively large sampling error. This makes it unsuitable for use in a small-sample context. We discuss the use of a previously published nonparametric test of genetic similarity for application to GWAS summary statistics. We establish that the null distribution of the test statistic is modelled better by an extreme value distribution than a transformation of the standard exponential distribution. We show with simulation studies and real data from GWAS of 18 phenotypes from the UK Biobank that the test is to be preferred for use with small sample sizes, particularly when genetic effects are few and large, outperforming the genetic correlation and another nonparametric statistical test of independence.

"37577697","Improving Genetic Association Studies with a Novel Methodology that Unveils the Hidden Complexity of All-Cause Heart Failure.","medRxiv","Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) commonly assume phenotypic and genetic homogeneity that is not present in complex conditions. We designed Transformative Regression Analysis of Combined Effects (TRACE), a GWAS methodology that better accounts for clinical phenotype heterogeneity and identifies gene-by-environment (GxE) interactions. We demonstrated with UK Biobank (UKB) data that TRACE increased the variance explained in All-Cause Heart Failure (AHF) via the discovery of novel single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and SNP-by-environment (i.e. GxE) interaction associations. First, we transformed 312 AHF-related ICD10 codes (including AHF) into continuous low-dimensional features (i.e., latent phenotypes) for a more nuanced disease representation. Then, we ran a standard GWAS on our latent phenotypes to discover main effects and identified GxE interactions with target encoding. Genes near associated SNPs subsequently underwent enrichment analysis to explore potential functional mechanisms underlying associations. Latent phenotypes were regressed against their SNP hits and the estimated latent phenotype values were used to measure the amount of AHF variance explained.Our method identified over 100 main GWAS effects that were consistent with prior studies and hundreds of novel gene-by-smoking interactions, which collectively accounted for approximately 10% of AHF variance. This represents an improvement over traditional GWAS whose results account for a negligible proportion of AHF variance. Enrichment analyses suggested that hundreds of miRNAs mediated the SNP effect on various AHF-related biological pathways. The TRACE framework can be applied to decode the genetics of other complex diseases.All code is available at https://github.com/EpistasisLab/latent_phenotype_project."

Large-scale studies on the association between SUA and VTE in East Asian populations are lacking, despite the high prevalence of hyperuricemia in this region. To address this, we conducted a cohort analysis and a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study in East Asian populations.We collected data on VTE patients from the China Pulmonary Thromboembolism Registry Study (CURES) and compared them to controls obtained from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Survey (CHARLS). Propensity score matching (PSM) and cubic-spline models were applied to assess the effect of SUA on VTE risk while adjusting for multiple covariates. We also performed two-sample MR analyses to infer potential causality based on summary statistics from Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS) of SUA and VTE in the East Asian population.We found that the SUA levels were higher in VTE patients (317.95 mmol/L) compared to the general population (295.75 mmol/L), and SUA ≥ 325 mmol/L was associated with an increased risk of VTE recurrence (P-value = 0.0001). The univariable MR suggested a causal relationship between elevated SUA and higher VTE risk (Pinverse variance weighted< 0.05), and multivariable MR showed that elevated SUA levels continued to promote the development of VTE after adjusting for multiple covariates (Pmultivariable residual< 0.05). Sensitivity analyses produced similar results for these estimations.Our study provides evidence supporting a robust positive association between SUA and VTE in the East Asian population, and MR analyses suggest that this association is likely to be causal. Our findings underscore the importance of monitoring SUA levels in VTE prevention and call for urgent action to address the growing burden of hyperuricemia in the Asia-Pacific region.This research was funded by Beijing Nova Program (No. Z211100002121057), National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 82100065 and No. 62350004), CAMS Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences (No. 2021-I2M-1-061 and No. 2021-1-I2M-001), Elite Medical Professionals project of China-Japan Friendship Hospital (No. ZRJY2021-QM12), National Key Research and Development Project (No. 2021YFF1201200 and No. 2022YFC3341004).© 2023 The Author(s)."

Epidemiological and clinical evidence suggests a relationship between corneal structural features and anthropometric measures. We used global and local genetic similarity analysis to identify genomic features that may underlie structural corneal dysfunction.We assembled genome-wide association study summary statistics for corneal features (central corneal thickness, corneal hysteresis [CH], corneal resistance factor [CRF], and the 3 mm index of keratometry) and anthropometric traits (body mass index, weight, and height) in Europeans. We calculated global genetic correlations (rg) between traits using linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression and local genetic covariance using ρ-HESS, which partitions the genome and performs regression with LD regions. Finally, we identified genes located within regions of significant genetic covariance and analyzed patterns of tissue expression and pathway enrichment.Global LD score regression revealed significant negative correlations between height and both CH (rg = -0.12; P = 2.0 × 10-7) and CRF (rg = -0.11; P = 6.9 × 10-7). Local analysis revealed 68 genomic regions exhibiting significant local genetic covariance between CRF and height, containing 2874 unique genes. Pathway analysis of genes in regions with significant local rg revealed enrichment among signaling pathways with known keratoconus associations, including cadherin and Wnt signaling, as well as enrichment of genes modulated by copper and zinc ions.Corneal biophysical parameters and height share a common genomic architecture, which may facilitate identification of disease-associated genes and therapies for corneal ectasias.Local genetic covariance analysis enables the identification of associated genes and therapeutic targets for corneal ectatic disease."

The causality of this association is uncertain, but it would be clinically important, given that 25(OH)D can be a target for intervention. We tried to examine the causal effect of 25(OH)D concentration on cSVD-related phenotypes using a Mendelian randomization approach.Genetic instruments for each serum 25(OH)D concentration and cSVD-related phenotypes (lacunar stroke, white matter hyperintensity, cerebral microbleeds, and perivascular spaces) were derived from large-scale genome-wide association studies. We performed 2-sample Mendelian randomization analyses with multiple post hoc sensitivity analyses. A bidirectional Mendelian randomization approach was also used to explore the possibility of reverse causation.We failed to find any significant causal effect of 25(OH)D concentration on cSVD-related phenotypes (odds ratio [95% CI], 1.00 [0.87-1.16], 1.01 [0.96-1.07], 1.06 [0.85-1.33], 1.00 [0.97-1.03], 1.02 [0.99-1.04], 1.01 [0.99-1.04] for lacunar stroke, white matter hyperintensity, cerebral microbleeds, and white matter, basal ganglia, hippocampal perivascular spaces, respectively). These results were reproduced in the sensitivity analyses accounting for genetic pleiotropy. Conversely, when we examined the effects of cSVD phenotypes on 25(OH)D concentration, cerebral microbleeds were negatively associated with 25(OH)D concentration (0.94 [0.92-0.96]).Given the adequate statistical power (>0.8) of the analyses, our findings suggest that the previously reported association between 25(OH)D concentration and cSVD phenotypes might not be causal and partly attributed to reverse causation."

"37592021",NA,NA,"The Iron Age was a dynamic period in central Mediterranean history, with the expansion of Greek and Phoenician colonies and the growth of Carthage into the dominant maritime power of the Mediterranean. These events were facilitated by the ease of long-distance travel following major advances in seafaring. We know from the archaeological record that trade goods and materials were moving across great distances in unprecedented quantities, but it is unclear how these patterns correlate with human mobility. Here, to investigate population mobility and interactions directly, we sequenced the genomes of 30 ancient individuals from coastal cities around the central Mediterranean, in Tunisia, Sardinia and central Italy. We observe a meaningful contribution of autochthonous populations, as well as highly heterogeneous ancestry including many individuals with non-local ancestries from other parts of the Mediterranean region. These results highlight both the role of local populations and the extreme interconnectedness of populations in the Iron Age Mediterranean. By studying these trans-Mediterranean neighbours together, we explore the complex interplay between local continuity and mobility that shaped the Iron Age societies of the central Mediterranean.© 2023.

The plant of traditional Chinese medicine ""Qinghao"" is called Artemisia annua L. in Chinese Pharmacopoeia. High content and the total amount of artemisinin is the main goal of A. annua breeding, nevertheless, the change of chromatin organization during the artemisinin synthesis process has not been discovered yet. This study intended to find the roles of chromatin structure in the production of artemisinin through bioinformatics and experimental validation. Chromosome conformation capture analysis was used to scrutinize the interactions among chromosomes and categorize various scales of chromatin during artemisinin synthesis in A. annua. To confirm the effect of the changes in chromatin structure, Hi-C and RNA-sequencing were performed on two different strains to find the correlation between chromatin structure and gene expression levels on artemisinin synthesis progress and regulation. Our results revealed that the frequency of intra-chromosomal interactions was higher in the inter-chromosomal interactions between the root and leaves on a high artemisinin production strain (HAP) compared to a low artemisinin production strain (LAP). We found that compartmental transition was connected with interactions among different chromatins. Interestingly, glandular secreting trichomes (GSTs) and the artemisinin biosynthetic pathway (ABP) related genes were enriched in the areas which have the compartmental transition, reflecting the regulation of artemisinin synthesis. Topologically associated domain boundaries were associated with various distributions of genes and expression levels. Genes associated with ABP and GST in the adjacent loop were highly expressed, suggesting that epigenetic regulation plays an important role during artemisinin synthesis and glandular secreting trichomes production process. Chromatin structure could show an important status in the mechanisms of artemisinin synthesis process in A. annua.© 2023.

Therefore, the aim of our study was to investigate whether a genetic risk score (GRS) comprising risk alleles of SNPs identified in the GIANT consortium meta-analyses shows association with body mass index (BMI) and other BMI related metabolic alterations in a cohort with an extreme phenotype. Genotyping of 93 SNPs was performed in 314 obese individuals (mean BMI 40.5 ± 7.8 kg/m², aged 45 ± 12 years), participating in a standardized weight reduction program, and in 74 lean controls (mean BMI 24.6 ± 3.3 kg/m², aged 41.7 ± 13.4 years). Allele numbers of all 93 SNPs were added to a GRS. Anthropometric parameters, parameters of glucose/insulin and lipid metabolism were assessed standardized after a 12 hours fast. GRS was significantly different between controls and obese individuals (unweighted GRS: 86.6 vs 89.0, P = .002; weighted GRS: 84.9 vs 88.3, P = .005). Furthermore, linear regression analysis showed significant associations of GRS with BMI (P < .0001), weight (P = .0005), waist circumference (P = .0039), fat mass (P < .0001) and epicardial fat thickness (P = .0032), yet with small effect sizes (r² < 0.06).

Germ cells were labelled with SOX17, VASA (classic germ cells marker), phosphohistone H3 (PHH3, mitosis marker) and synaptonemal complex protein 3 (SCP3, meiosis marker).SOX17 was detected in both cytoplasm and nucleus of oogonia and oocytes of primordial and primary follicles from 15 to 28 gestational weeks (GW). However, it was exclusively expressed in cytoplasm of oogonia at 7 GW, and in nucleus of oocytes in secondary follicles. Co-expression rates of SOX17 in VASA+germ cells ranged from 81.29% to 97.81% in foetuses. Co-staining rates of SOX17 and PHH3 or SCP3 were 0%-34% and 0%-57%, respectively. Interestingly, we distinguished a subpopulation of SOX17+VASA-germ cells in fetal ovaries. These cells clustered in the cortex and could be co-stained with the mitosis marker PHH3 but not the meiosis marker SCP3.The dynamic expression of SOX17 was detected in human female germ cells. We discovered a population of SOX17+VASA-germ cells clustering at the cortex of ovaries. We could not find a relationship between mitosis or meiosis and SOX17 or VASA staining in germ cells. Our findings provide insight into the potential role of SOX17 involving germ cells maturation after specification, although the mechanism is unclear and needs further investigation.Copyright © 2023 Luo, Jie, Huang, Cai, Zhou, Liang, Zhou and Mai."

The skin-derived stem cells (SDSCs) differentiation into primordial germ cell-like cells (PGCLCs) is one of the major breakthroughs in the field of stem cells intervention for infertility treatment in recent years. However, the cellular origin of SDSCs and their dynamic changes in transcription profile during differentiation into PGCLCs in vitro remain largely undissected. Here, the results of single-cell RNA sequencing indicated that porcine SDSCs are mainly derived from multipotent dermal fibroblast progenitors (MDFPs), which are regulated by growth factors (EGF/bFGF). Importantly, porcine SDSCs exhibit pluripotency for differentiating into three germ layers and can effectively differentiate into PGCLCs through complex transcriptional regulation involving histone modification. Moreover, this study also highlights that porcine SDSC-derived PGCLCs specification exhibit conservation with the human primordial germ cells lineage and that its proliferation is mediated by the MAPK signaling pathway. Our findings provide substantial novel insights into the field of regenerative medicine in which stem cells differentiate into germ cells in vitro, as well as potential therapeutic effects in individuals with azoospermia and/or defective oocytes.© 2023.

However, insufficient coverage makes it challenging to implement single-stranded DNA methylation sequencing technologies, highlighting the need for an efficient prediction model. Models are required to create an understanding of the underlying biological systems and to project single-cell (methylated) data accurately.In this study, we developed positional features for predicting CpG sites. Positional characteristics of the sequence are derived using data from CpG regions and the separation between nearby CpG sites. Multiple optimized classifiers and different ensemble learning approaches are evaluated. The OPTUNA framework is used to optimize the algorithms. The CatBoost algorithm followed by the stacking algorithm outperformed existing DNA methylation identifiers.The data and methodologies used in this study are openly accessible to the research community. Researchers can access the positional features and algorithms used for predicting CpG site methylation patterns. To achieve superior performance, we employed the CatBoost algorithm followed by the stacking algorithm, which outperformed existing DNA methylation identifiers. The proposed iCpG-Pos approach utilizes only positional features, resulting in a substantial reduction in computational complexity compared to other known approaches for detecting CpG site methylation patterns. In conclusion, our study introduces a novel approach, iCpG-Pos, for predicting CpG site methylation patterns. By focusing on positional features, our model offers both accuracy and efficiency, making it a promising tool for advancing DNA methylation research and its applications in human health and well-being.© The Author(s) 2023.

However, their use for genomic analysis and response monitoring of pediatric solid tumors is still in experimental stages and mostly performed retrospectively without direct impact on patient management. In this case series we discuss six clinical cases of children with a solid tumor for whom a liquid biopsy assay was performed and demonstrate the potential of liquid biopsy for future clinical decision making.We performed quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR), droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) or reduced representation bisulphite sequencing of cell-free DNA (cfRRBS) on liquid biopsies collected from six pediatric patients with a solid tumor treated between 2017 and 2023 at the Princess Máxima Center for Pediatric Oncology in the Netherlands. Results were used to aid in clinical decision making by contribution to establish a diagnosis, by prognostication and response to therapy monitoring.In three patients cfRRBS helped to establish the diagnosis of a rhabdomyosarcoma, an Ewing sarcoma and a neuroblastoma (case 1-3). In two patients, liquid biopsies were used for prognostication, by MYCN ddPCR in a patient with neuroblastoma and by RT-qPCR testing rhabdomyosarcoma-specific mRNA in bone marrow of a patient with a rhabdomyosarcoma (case 4 and 5). In case 6, mRNA testing demonstrated disease progression and assisted clinical decision making.This case series illustrates the value of liquid biopsy. We further demonstrate and recommend the use of liquid biopsies to be used in conjunction with conventional methods for the determination of metastatic status, prognostication and monitoring of treatment response in patients with pediatric solid tumors.Copyright © 2023 Gelineau, van Barneveld, Samim, Van Zogchel, Lak, Tas, Matser, Mavinkurve-Groothuis, van Grotel, Zsiros, van Eijkelenburg, Knops, van Ewijk, Langenberg, Krijger, Hiemcke-Jiwa, Van Paemel, Cornelli, De Preter, De Wilde, Van Der Schoot and Tytgat."
"37599992",NA,NA,"Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder and the leading monogenic cause of autism and intellectual disability. For years, several efforts have been made to develop an effective therapeutic approach to phenotypically rescue patients from the disorder, with some even advancing to late phases of clinical trials. Unfortunately, none of these attempts have completely succeeded, bringing urgency to further expand and refocus research on FXS therapeutics. FXS arises at early stages of postnatal development due to the mutation and transcriptional silencing of the Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein 1 gene (FMR1) and consequent loss of the Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein (FMRP) expression. Importantly, FMRP expression is critical for the normal adult nervous system function, particularly during specific windows of embryogenic and early postnatal development. Cellular proliferation, migration, morphology, axonal guidance, synapse formation, and in general, neuronal network establishment and maturation are abnormally regulated in FXS, underlying the cognitive and behavioral phenotypes of the disorder. In this review, we highlight the relevance of therapeutically intervening during critical time points of development, such as early postnatal periods in infants and young children and discuss past and current clinical trials in FXS and their potential to specifically target those periods. We also discuss potential benefits, limitations, and disadvantages of these pharmacological tools based on preclinical and clinical research.Copyright © 2023 Milla, Corral, Rivera, Zuñiga, Pino, Nunez-Parra and Cea-Del Rio."
"37651081","Potential Key Proteins, Molecular Networks, and Pathways in Perinatal Hypoxia.","Neurotox Res","Perinatal hypoxia is a common risk factor for CNS development. Using bioinformatics databases, a list of 129 genes involved in perinatal hypoxia was selected from the literature and analyzed with respect to proteins important for biological processes influencing the brain development. Functional enrichment analysis using the DAVID database was performed to identify relevant Gene Ontology (GO) biological processes like response to hypoxia, inflammatory response, positive and negative regulation of apoptosis, and positive and negative regulation of cell proliferation. The selected GO processes contain 17-30 proteins and show an enrichment of 6.3-14.3-fold. The STRING protein-protein interaction network and the Cytoscape data analyzer were used to identify interacting proteins playing a significant role in these processes. The two top protein pairs referring to the proteins with highest degrees and the corresponding proteins connected by high score edges exert opposite or regulatory functions and are essential for the balance between damaging, repairing, protective, or epigenetic processes. The GO response to hypoxia is characterized by the high score protein-protein interaction pairs CASP3/FAS promoting apoptosis and by the protective acting BDNF/MECP2 protein pair. Core components of the GO processes positive and negative regulation of apoptosis are the proteins CASP3/FAS/AKT/eNOS/RPS6KB1 involved in several signal pathways. The GO processes cell proliferation are characterized by the high-score protein-protein interaction pairs MYC/ MAPK1, JUN/MAPK1, IL6/IL1B, and JUN/HDAC1. The study provides new insights into the pathophysiology of perinatal hypoxia and is of importance for future investigations, diagnostics, and therapy of perinatal hypoxia.© 2023.

This may be attributed to intrinsic molecular differences or scoring methods for AR positivity. We derived AR regulated gene score and examined its utility in BC subtypes.AR regulated genes were derived by applying a bioinformatic pipeline on publicly available microarray data sets of AR+ BC cell lines and gene score was calculated as average expression of six AR regulated genes. Tumors were divided into AR high and low based on gene score and associations with clinical parameters, circulating androgens, survival and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers were examined, further evaluated in invitro models and public datasets.53% (133/249) tumors were classified as AR gene score high and were associated with significantly better clinical parameters, disease-free survival (86.13 vs 72.69 months, log rank p = 0.032) when compared to AR low tumors. 36% of TNBC (N = 66) were AR gene score high with higher expression of EMT markers (p = 0.024) and had high intratumoral levels of 5α-reductase, enzyme involved in intracrine androgen metabolism. In MDA-MB-453 treated with dihydrotestosterone, SLUG expression increased, E-cadherin decreased with increase in migration and these changes were reversed with bicalutamide. Similar results were obtained in public datasets.Deciphering the role of AR in BC is difficult based on AR protein levels alone.

Therapeutics and outcomes remain hidden because we lack insights that we could gain from analyzing ancestry-unbiased genomic data. To address this significant gap, we present PhyloFrame, the first-ever machine learning method for equitable genomic precision medicine. PhyloFrame corrects for ancestral bias by integrating big data tissue-specific functional interaction networks, global population variation data, and disease-relevant transcriptomic data. Application of PhyloFrame to breast, thyroid, and uterine cancers shows marked improvements in predictive power across all ancestries, less model overfitting, and a higher likelihood of identifying known cancer-related genes. The ability to provide accurate predictions for underrepresented groups, in particular, is substantially increased. These results demonstrate how AI can mitigate ancestral bias in training data and contribute to equitable representation in medical research."
"37503080","Contextualizing protein representations using deep learning on protein networks and single-cell data.","bioRxiv","Understanding protein function and discovering molecular therapies require deciphering the cell types in which proteins act as well as the interactions between proteins. However, modeling protein interactions across diverse biological contexts, such as tissues and cell types, remains a significant challenge for existing algorithms. We introduce P innacle , a flexible geometric deep learning approach that is trained on contextualized protein interaction networks to generate context-aware protein representations. Leveraging a human multiorgan single-cell transcriptomic atlas, P innacle provides 394,760 protein representations split across 156 cell type contexts from 24 tissues and organs. P innacle 's contextualized representations of proteins reflect cellular and tissue organization and P innacle 's tissue representations enable zero-shot retrieval of the tissue hierarchy. Pretrained P innacle protein representations can be adapted for downstream tasks: to enhance 3D structure-based protein representations (PD-1/PD-L1 and B7-1/CTLA-4) at cellular resolution and to study the genomic effects of drugs across cellular contexts. P innacle outperforms state-of-the-art, yet context-free, models in nominating therapeutic targets for rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel diseases, and can pinpoint cell type contexts that are more predictive of therapeutic targets than context-free models (29 out of 156 cell types in rheumatoid arthritis; 13 out of 152 cell types in inflammatory bowel diseases). P innacle is a network-based contextual AI model that dynamically adjusts its outputs based on biological contexts in which it operates."

There is a lack of knowledge regarding individual differences in susceptibility to exposure to MSP. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) genes are involved in protection against harmful oxidants such as those found in cigarette smoke. This study aimed to test whether polymorphisms inGSTgenes influence the effect of MSP on offspring DNAm. Using data from the Isle of Wight birth cohort, we assessed the association of MSP and offspring DNAm in 493 mother-child dyads (251 male, 242 female) with the effect-modifying role ofGSTgene polymorphism (at rs506008, rs574344, rs12736389, rs3768490, rs1537234, and rs1695). MSP was assessed by levels of nicotine and its downstream metabolites (cotinine, norcotinine, and hydroxycotinine) in maternal sera. In males, associations of hydroxycotinine with DNAm at cg18473733, cg25949550, cg11647108, and cg01952185 and norcotinine with DNAm at cg09935388 were modified byGSTgene polymorphisms (p-values < 0.05). In females, associations of hydroxycotinine with DNAm at cg12160087 and norcotinine with DNAm at cg18473733 were modified byGSTgene polymorphisms (p-values < 0.05).

However, the molecular mechanisms contributing to the differing adaptations between the sexes are poorly understood.We performed a meta-analysis for sex differences in skeletal muscle DNA methylation following an endurance training intervention (Gene SMART cohort and E-MTAB-11282 cohort). We investigated for sex differences in the skeletal muscle proteome following an endurance training intervention (Gene SMART cohort). Lastly, we investigated whether the methylome and proteome are associated with baseline cardiorespiratory fitness (maximal oxygen consumption; VO2max) in a sex-specific manner.Here, we investigated for the first time, DNA methylome and proteome sex differences in response to exercise training in human skeletal muscle (n = 78; 50 males, 28 females). We identified 92 DNA methylation sites (CpGs) associated with exercise training; however, no CpGs changed in a sex-dependent manner. In contrast, we identified 189 proteins that are differentially expressed between the sexes following training, with 82 proteins differentially expressed between the sexes at baseline. Proteins showing the most robust sex-specific response to exercise include SIRT3, MRPL41, and MBP. Irrespective of sex, cardiorespiratory fitness was associated with robust methylome changes (19,257 CpGs) and no proteomic changes. We did not observe sex differences in the association between cardiorespiratory fitness and the DNA methylome. Integrative multi-omic analysis identified sex-specific mitochondrial metabolism pathways associated with exercise responses. Lastly, exercise training and cardiorespiratory fitness shifted the DNA methylomes to be more similar between the sexes.We identified sex differences in protein expression changes, but not DNA methylation changes, following an endurance exercise training intervention; whereas we identified no sex differences in the DNA methylome or proteome response to lifelong training. Given the delicate interaction between sex and training as well as the limitations of the current study, more studies are required to elucidate whether there is a sex-specific training effect on the DNA methylome. We found that genes involved in mitochondrial metabolism pathways are differentially modulated between the sexes following endurance exercise training.

Despite these successes, the identification of specific causal variants underlying a genetic association signal remains challenging. In this study, we describe a deep learning (DL) method to analyze the impact of sequence variants on enhancers. Focusing on pancreatic islets, a T2D relevant tissue, we show that our model learns islet-specific transcription factor (TF) regulatory patterns and can be used to prioritize candidate causal variants. At 101 genetic signals associated with T2D and related glycemic traits where multiple variants occur in linkage disequilibrium, our method nominates a single causal variant for each association signal, including three variants previously shown to alter reporter activity in islet-relevant cell types. For another signal associated with blood glucose levels, we biochemically test all candidate causal variants from statistical fine-mapping using a pancreatic islet beta cell line and show biochemical evidence of allelic effects on TF binding for the model-prioritized variant. To aid in future research, we publicly distribute our model and islet enhancer perturbation scores across ~67 million genetic variants. We anticipate that DL methods like the one presented in this study will enhance the prioritization of candidate causal variants for functional studies."

We identified sCNVs using blood-derived genotype arrays from 12,834 SCZ cases and 11,648 controls, filtering sCNVs at loci recurrently mutated in clonal blood disorders. Likely early-developmental sCNVs were more common in cases (0.91%) than controls (0.51%, p = 2.68e-4), with recurrent somatic deletions of exons 1-5 of theNRXN1gene in five SCZ cases. Hi-C maps revealed ectopic, allele-specific loops forming between a potential cryptic promoter and non-codingcis-regulatory elements upon 5' deletions inNRXN1. We also observed recurrent intragenic deletions ofABCB11, encoding a transporter implicated in anti-psychotic response, in five treatment-resistant SCZ cases and showed thatABCB11is specifically enriched in neurons forming mesocortical and mesolimbic dopaminergic projections.

"37593997","Refined read-out: The hUHRF1 Tandem-Tudor domain prefers binding to histone H3 tails containing K4me1 in the context of H3K9me2/3.","Protein Sci","UHRF1 is an essential chromatin protein required for DNA methylation maintenance, mammalian development, and gene regulation. We investigated the Tandem-Tudor domain (TTD) of human UHRF1 that is known to bind H3K9me2/3 histones and is a major driver of UHRF1 localization in cells. We verified binding to H3K9me2/3 but unexpectedly discovered stronger binding to H3 peptides and mononucleosomes containing K9me2/3 with additional K4me1. We investigated the combined binding of TTD to H3K4me1-K9me2/3 versus H3K9me2/3 alone, engineered mutants with specific and differential changes of binding, and discovered a novel read-out mechanism for H3K4me1 in an H3K9me2/3 context that is based on the interaction of R207 with the H3K4me1 methyl group and on counting the H-bond capacity of H3K4. Individual TTD mutants showed up to a 10,000-fold preference for the double-modified peptides, suggesting that after a conformational change, WT TTD could exhibit similar effects. The frequent appearance of H3K4me1-K9me2 regions in human chromatin demonstrated in our TTD chromatin pull-down and ChIP-western blot data suggests that it has specific biological roles. Chromatin pull-down of TTD from HepG2 cells and full-length murine UHRF1 ChIP-seq data correlate with H3K4me1 profiles indicating that the H3K4me1-K9me2/3 interaction of TTD influences chromatin binding of full-length UHRF1. We demonstrate the H3K4me1-K9me2/3 specific binding of UHRF1-TTD to enhancers and promoters of cell-type-specific genes at the flanks of cell-type-specific transcription factor binding sites, and provided evidence supporting an H3K4me1-K9me2/3 dependent and TTD mediated downregulation of these genes by UHRF1. All these findings illustrate the important physiological function of UHRF1-TTD binding to H3K4me1-K9me2/3 double marks in a cellular context.© 2023 The Authors.

DNAm patterns are further perturbed in hematological malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia but the physiological significance of such epigenetic changes is unknown. Using epigenetic editing of human stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), we show that p15 methylation affects hematopoiesis in vivo. We edited theCDKN2B(p15) promoter andARF(p14) using dCas9-3A3L and observed DNAm spreading beyond the gRNA location. We find that despite a transient delivery system, DNAm is maintained during myeloid differentiation in vitro, and hypermethylation of the p15 promoter reduces gene expression. In vivo, edited human HSPCs can engraft the bone marrow of mice and targeted DNAm is maintained in HSPCs long term. Moreover, epigenetic changes are conserved and inherited in both myeloid and lymphoid lineages. Although the proportion of myeloid (CD33+) and lymphoid (CD19+) cells is unaffected, monocyte (CD14+) populations decreased and granulocytes (CD66b+) increased in mice engrafted with p15 hypermethylated HSPCs. Monocytes derived from p15 hypermethylated HSPCs appear to be activated and show increased inflammatory transcriptional programs. We believe these findings have clinical relevance since we found p15 promoter methylation in the peripheral blood of patients with clonal hematopoiesis. Our study shows DNAm can be targeted and maintained in human HSPCs and demonstrated functional relevance of aberrant DNAm on the p15 locus. As such, other aging-associated aberrant DNAm may impact hematopoiesis in vivo."

Although key signaling pathways and transcription factors that control these early embryonic decisions have been identified, the non-coding regulatory elements via which transcriptional regulators enact these fates remain understudied. To address this gap, we have characterized, at a genome-wide scale, enhancer activity and 3D connectivity in embryo-derived stem cell lines that represent each of the early developmental fates. We observed extensive enhancer remodeling and fine-scale 3D chromatin rewiring among the three lineages, which strongly associate with transcriptional changes, although there are distinct groups of genes that are irresponsive to topological changes. In each lineage, a high degree of connectivity or ""hubness"" positively correlates with levels of gene expression and enriches for cell-type specific and essential genes. Genes within 3D hubs also show a significantly stronger probability of coregulation across lineages, compared to genes in linear proximity or within the same contact domains. By incorporating 3D chromatin features, we build a novel predictive model for transcriptional regulation (3D-HiChAT), which outperformed models that use only 1D promoter or proximal variables in predicting levels and cell-type specificity of gene expression. Using 3D-HiChAT, we performed genome-widein silicoperturbations to nominate candidate functional enhancers and hubs in each cell lineage, and with CRISPRi experiments we validated several novel enhancers that control expression of one or more genes in their respective lineages. Our study comprehensively identifies 3D regulatory hubs associated with the earliest mammalian lineages and describes their relationship to gene expression and cell identity, providing a framework to understand lineage-specific transcriptional behaviors."

However, these tools primarily rely on human or mouse data for training, limiting their performance when applied to other species. Furthermore, the limited exploration of many species, particularly in the case of livestock, has led to a scarcity of comprehensive and high-quality epigenetic data, posing challenges in developing reliable deep learning models for decoding their non-coding genomes. The cross-species prediction of the regulatory genome can be achieved by leveraging publicly available data from extensively studied organisms and making use of the conserved DNA binding preferences of transcription factors within the same tissue. In this study, we introduced DeepSATA, a novel deep learning-based sequence analyzer that incorporates the transcription factor binding affinity for the cross-species prediction of chromatin accessibility. By applying DeepSATA to analyze the genomes of pigs, chickens, cattle, humans, and mice, we demonstrated its ability to improve the prediction accuracy of chromatin accessibility and achieve reliable cross-species predictions in animals. Additionally, we showcased its effectiveness in analyzing pig genetic variants associated with economic traits and in increasing the accuracy of genomic predictions.

Here, we applied machine learning and bioinformatics trajectory inference to analyze a gene expression dataset of CRLM. We studied the co-regulation patterns at the gene level, the potential paths of tumor development, their functional context, and their prognostic relevance. Our analysis confirmed the subtyping of five liver metastasis subtypes (LMS). We provide gene-marker signatures for each LMS, and a comprehensive functional characterization that considers both the hallmarks of cancer and the tumor microenvironment. The ordering of CRLMs along a pseudotime-tree revealed a continuous shift in expression programs, suggesting a developmental relationship between the subtypes. Notably, trajectory inference and personalized analysis discovered a range of epigenetic states that shape and guide metastasis progression. By constructing prognostic maps that divided the expression landscape into regions associated with favorable and unfavorable prognoses, we derived a prognostic expression score. This was associated with critical processes such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition, treatment resistance, and immune evasion. These factors were associated with responses to neoadjuvant treatment and the formation of an immuno-suppressive, mesenchymal state. Our machine learning-based molecular profiling provides an in-depth characterization of CRLM heterogeneity with possible implications for treatment and personalized diagnostics."

Here, we analyzed a large transcriptomic dataset consisting of 48 different human CD4+T cell conditions. By performing reverse network engineering, we identified six common denominators of CD4+T cell functionality (CREB1, E2F3, AHR, STAT1, NFAT5 and NFATC3). Moreover, we also analyzed condition-specific genes which led us to the identification of the transcription factor MEOX1 in Tregcells. Expression of MEOX1 was comparable to FOXP3 in Tregcells and can be upregulated by IL-2. Epigenetic analyses revealed a permissive epigenetic landscape for MEOX1 solely in Tregcells. Knockdown of MEOX1 in Tregcells revealed a profound impact on downstream gene expression programs and Tregcell suppressive capacity.

Enhancer reprogramming is an important mechanism in cancer pathogenesis and can be driven by both cis and trans factors. Super enhancers are acquired at oncogenes in numerous cancer types and represent potential targets for cancer treatment. BET and CDK inhibitors act through mechanisms of enhancer function and have shown promising results in therapy for various types of cancer. Genome editing is another way to reprogram enhancers in cancer treatment. The relationship between enhancers and cancer has been revised by several authors in the past few years, which mainly focuses on the mechanisms by which enhancers can impact cancer.

Colocalization analyses and prospective gene-environment interaction analyses were also conducted as replication.Convincing evidence was identified for the pathogenic effect of smoking initiation on CRC risk and suggestive evidence was observed for the protective effect of smoking cessation in the univariable MR analyses. Multivariable MR analysis revealed that these associations were independent of other smoking phenotypes and alcohol drinking. Genetically predicted methylation at CpG site cg17823346 [ZMIZ1] were identified to decrease CRC risk; while genetically predicted methylation at cg02149899 would increase CRC risk.

"37605769","Association of DNA methylation signatures with cognitive performance among smokers and ex-smokers.","Tob Induc Dis","Alterations in DNA methylation profiles have been associated with cancer, and can be influenced by environmental factors such as smoking. A small but growing literature indicates there are reproducible and robust differences in methylation levels among smokers, never smokers, and ex-smokers. Here, we compared differences in salivary DNA methylation levels among current and ex-smokers (at least 2 years abstinent).Smokers (n=26) and ex-smokers (n=30) provided detailed smoking histories, completed the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT), and submitted a saliva sample. Whole-genome DNA methylation from saliva was performed, and ANCOVA models and a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were used for the differences between groups and the performance of significant CpG sites.After controlling for race, age, and gender, smokers had significantly lower methylation levels than ex-smokers in two CpG sites: cg05575921 (AHRR) and cg21566642 (ALPPL2). Based on the ROC analyses, both CpGs had strong classification potentials (cg05575921 AUC=0.97 and cg21566642 AUC=0.93) in differentiating smoking status. Across all subjects, the percent methylation of cg05575921 (AHRR) and cg21566642 (ALPPL2) positively correlated with the length of the last quit attempt (r=0.65 and 0.64, respectively, p<0.001) and PASAT accuracy (r=0.29 and 0.30, respectively, p<0.05).In spite of the small sample size and preliminary research, our results replicate previously reported differences in AHRR hypomethylation among smokers. Furthermore, we show that the duration of smoking abstinence is associated with a recovery of methylation in ex-smokers, which may be linked to a reduced risk of smoking-associated diseases. The association with cognitive performance suggests that the hypomethylation of AHRR in saliva may reflect systemic exposure to cigarette-related toxicants that negatively affect cognitive performance, and should be validated in larger studies.© 2023 Hsu P.C. et al."
"37650081","Alzheimer's Disease Protein Relevance Analysis Using Human and Mouse Model Proteomics Data.","Front Syst Biol","The principles governing genotype-phenotype relationships are still emerging(1-3), and detailed translational as well as transcriptomic information is required to understand complex phenotypes, such as the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. For this reason, the proteomics of Alzheimer disease (AD) continues to be studied extensively. Although comparisons between data obtained from humans and mouse models have been reported, approaches that specifically address the between-species statistical comparisons are understudied. Our study investigated the performance of two statistical methods for identification of proteins and biological pathways associated with Alzheimer's disease for cross-species comparisons, taking specific data analysis challenges into account, including collinearity, dimensionality reduction and cross-species protein matching. We used a human dataset from a well-characterized cohort followed for over 22 years with proteomic data available. For the mouse model, we generated proteomic data from whole brains of CVN-AD and matching control mouse models. We used these analyses to determine the reliability of a mouse model to forecast significant proteomic-based pathological changes in the brain that may mimic pathology in human Alzheimer's disease. Compared with LASSO regression, partial least squares discriminant analysis provided better statistical performance for the proteomics analysis. The major biological finding of the study was that extracellular matrix proteins and integrin-related pathways were dysregulated in both the human and mouse data. This approach may help inform the development of mouse models that are more relevant to the study of human late-onset Alzheimer's disease."

Here we demonstrate that elovanoids (ELVs), mediators derived from very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (VLC-PUFAs, n-3, C > 28), and their precursors in neurons in culture overcome the damage triggered by oligomeric amyloid-beta (OAβ), erastin (ferroptosis-dependent cell death), or other insults that target epigenomic signaling. We uncover that ELVs counteract damage targeting histones H3K9 and H3K27 methylation and acetylation; tau hyperphosphorylation (pThr181, pThr217, pThr231, and pSer202/pThr205 (AT8)); senescence gene programming (p16INK4a, p27KIP, p21CIP1, and p53); DNA methylation (DNAm) modifying enzymes: TET (DNA hydroxymethylase), DNA methyltransferase, DNA demethylase, and DNAm (5mC) phenotype. Moreover, ELVs revert OAβ-triggered telomere length (TL) attrition as well as upregulation of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) expression fostering dendrite protection and neuronal survival. Thus, ELVs modulate epigenomic resiliency by pleiotropic interrelated signaling."

"37560024","Promises and challenges in pharmacoepigenetics.","Camb Prism Precis Med","Pharmacogenetics, the study of how interindividual genetic differences affect drug response, does not explain all observed heritable variance in drug response. Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, and histone acetylation may account for some of the unexplained variances. Epigenetic mechanisms modulate gene expression and can be suitable drug targets and can impact the action of nonepigenetic drugs. Pharmacoepigenetics is the field that studies the relationship between epigenetic variability and drug response. Much of this research focuses on compounds targeting epigenetic mechanisms, called epigenetic drugs, which are used to treat cancers, immune disorders, and other diseases. Several studies also suggest an epigenetic role in classical drug response; however, we know little about this area. The amount of information correlating epigenetic biomarkers to molecular datasets has recently expanded due to technological advances, and novel computational approaches have emerged to better identify and predict epigenetic interactions. We propose that the relationship between epigenetics and classical drug response may be examined using data already available by (1) finding regions of epigenetic variance, (2) pinpointing key epigenetic biomarkers within these regions, and (3) mapping these biomarkers to a drug-response phenotype. This approach expands on existing knowledge to generate putative pharmacoepigenetic relationships, which can be tested experimentally. Epigenetic modifications are involved in disease and drug response. Therefore, understanding how epigenetic drivers impact the response to classical drugs is important for improving drug design and administration to better treat disease.© The Author(s) 2023."
"37662959","Heterogeneity of memory T cells in aging.","Front Immunol","Immune memory is a requisite and remarkable property of the immune system and is the biological foundation of the success of vaccinations in reducing morbidity from infectious diseases. Some vaccines and infections induce long-lasting protection, but immunity to other vaccines and particularly in older adults rarely persists over long time periods. Failed induction of an immune response and accelerated waning of immune memory both contribute to the immuno-compromised state of the older population. Here we review how T cell memory is influenced by age. T cell memory is maintained by a dynamic population of T cells that are heterogeneous in their kinetic parameters under homeostatic condition and their function. Durability of T cell memory can be influenced not only by the loss of a clonal progeny, but also by broader changes in the composition of functional states and transition of T cells to a dysfunctional state. Genome-wide single cell studies on total T cells have started to provide insights on the influence of age on cell heterogeneity over time. The most striking findings were a trend to progressive effector differentiation and the activation of pro-inflammatory pathways, including the emergence of CD4+and CD8+cytotoxic subsets. Genome-wide data on antigen-specific memory T cells are currently limited but can be expected to provide insights on how changes in T cell subset heterogeneity and transcriptome relate to durability of immune protection.Copyright © 2023 Jain, Sturmlechner, Weyand and Goronzy."
"37556197","Stimulating the Uptake of Preconception Care by Women With a Vulnerable Health Status Through mHealth App-Based Nudging (Pregnant Faster): Cocreation Design and Protocol for a Cohort Study.","JMIR Res Protoc","Women with a low socioeconomic status often have a vulnerable health status due to an accumulation of health-deteriorating factors such as poor lifestyle behaviors, including inadequate nutrition, mental stressors, and impaired health literacy and agency, which puts them at an unnecessary high risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Adequately preparing for pregnancy through preconception care (PCC) uptake and lifestyle improvement can improve these outcomes. We hypothesize that nudging is a successful way of encouraging engagement in PCC. A nudge is a behavioral intervention that changes choice behavior through influencing incentives. The mobile health (mHealth) app-based loyalty program Pregnant Faster aims to reward women in an ethically justified way and nudges to engage in pregnancy preparation by visiting a PCC consultation.Here, we first describe the process of the cocreation of the mHealth app Pregnant Faster that aims to increase engagement in pregnancy preparation by women with a vulnerable health status. Second, we describe the cohort study design to assess the feasibility of Pregnant Faster.The content of the app is based on the eHealth lifestyle coaching program Smarter Pregnancy, which has proven to be effective in ameliorating preconceptional lifestyle behaviors (folic acid, vegetables, fruits, smoking, and alcohol) and an interview study pertaining to the preferences of the target group with regard to an mHealth app stimulating PCC uptake. For moral guidance on the design, an ethical framework was developed based on the bioethical principles of Beauchamp and Childress. The app was further developed through iterative cocreation with the target group and health care providers. For 4 weeks, participants will engage with Pregnant Faster, during which opportunities will arise to earn coins such as reading informative blogs and registering for a PCC consultation. Coins can be spent on small fun rewards, such as folic acid, fruits, and mascara. Pregnant Faster's feasibility will be tested in a study including 40 women aged 18 to 45 years, who are preconceptional or <8 weeks pregnant, with a low educational level, and living in a deprived neighborhood. The latter 2 factors will serve as a proxy of a low socioeconomic status. Recruitment will take place through flyers, social media, and health care practices. After finalization, participants will evaluate the app through the ""mHealth App Usability Questionnaire"" and additional interviews or questionnaires.Results are expected to be published by December 2023.Pregnant Faster has been designed through iterative cocreation with the target group and health care professionals. With the designed study, we will test Pregnant Faster's feasibility. If overall user satisfaction and PCC uptake is achieved, the app will be further developed and the cohort will be continued with an additional 400 inclusions to establish effectiveness.DERR1-10.2196/45293.©Sharissa M Smith, Babette Bais, Hafez Ismaili M'hamdi, Maartje H N Schermer, Regine P M Steegers-Theunissen.

Chronic joint inflammation triggers the diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in approximately one-third of psoriasis patients. Although joint disease typically follows the onset of skin psoriasis, in around 15% of cases it is the initial presentation, which can result in diagnostic delays. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying psoriasis and PsA are not yet fully understood, but there is evidence pointing towards epigenetic dysregulation involving CD4+and CD8+T-cells.The aim of this study was to investigate disease-associated DNA methylation patterns in CD4+T-cells from psoriasis and PsA patients that may represent potential diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarkers.PBMCs were collected from 12 patients with chronic plaque psoriasis and 8 PsA patients, and 8 healthy controls. CD4+T-cells were separated through FACS sorting, and DNA methylation profiling was performed (Illumina EPIC850K arrays). Bioinformatic analyses, including gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway analysis, were performed using R. To identify genes under the control of interferon (IFN), theInterferomedatabase was consulted, and DNA Methylation Scores were calculated.Numbers and proportions of CD4+T-cell subsets (naïve, central memory, effector memory, CD45RA re-expressing effector memory cells) did not vary between controls, skin psoriasis and PsA patients. 883 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) affecting 548 genes were identified between controls and ""all"" psoriasis patients. Principal component and partial least-squares discriminant analysis separated controls from skin psoriasis and PsA patients. GO analysis considering promoter DMPs delivered hypermethylation of genes involved in ""regulation of wound healing, spreading of epidermal cells"", ""negative regulation of cell-substrate junction organization"" and ""negative regulation of focal adhesion assembly"". Comparing controls and ""all"" psoriasis, a majority of DMPs mapped to IFN-related genes (69.2%). Notably, DNA methylation profiles also distinguished skin psoriasis from PsA patients (2,949 DMPs/1,084 genes) through genes affecting ""cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor activity"" and ""cAMP-dependent protein kinase regulator activity"". Treatment with cytokine inhibitors (IL-17/TNF) corrected DNA methylation patterns of IL-17/TNF-associated genes, and methylation scores correlated with skin disease activity scores (PASI).DNA methylation profiles in CD4+T-cells discriminate between skin psoriasis and PsA. DNA methylation signatures may be applied for quantification of disease activity and patient stratification towards individualized treatment.Copyright © 2023 Natoli, Charras, Hofmann, Northey, Russ, Schulze, McCann, Abraham and Hedrich."

Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is a key enzyme in prostaglandin biosynthesis. Its expression has always been associated with the induction of inflammation, but we have shown that, in addition to possessing other benefits, the constitutive expression of COX-2 in hepatocytes is beneficial in reducing inflammation and oxidative stress in multiple liver diseases. In this review, we summarized the role of NRF2 as a main agent in the resolution of oxidative stress, the crucial role of NRF2 signaling pathways during the development of chronic liver diseases, and, finally we related its action to that of COX-2, where it appears to operate as its partner in providing a hepatoprotective effect."

The involvement of heat shock proteins (HSPs) as etiological and pathogenetic factors is becoming of increasing interest. HSPs were found to be differentially expressed in the intestinal tissues and sera of patients with CD and UC. It has been shown that HSPs can play a dual role in the disease, depending on the stage of progression. They can support the inflammatory and fibrosis process, but they can also act as protective factors during disease progression or before the onset of one of the worst complications of IBD, colorectal cancer. Furthermore, HSPs are able to mediate the interaction between the intestinal microbiota and intestinal epithelial cells. In this work, we discuss the involvement of HSPs in IBD considering their genetic, epigenetic, immune and molecular roles, referring to the most recent works present in the literature. With our review, we want to shed light on the importance of further exploring the role of HSPs, or even better, the role of the molecular chaperone system (CS), in IBD: various molecules of the CS including HSPs may have diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic potential, promoting the creation of new drugs that could overcome the side-effects of the therapies currently used."

Understanding the prognosis of intelligence, motor skills, and psychology in children from ART would provide parents with reasonable expectations and enable them to plan relevant support to achieve the optimum potential in ART children.We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Ovid, Google Scholar, and Scopus databases until April 13, 2021, to identify relevant studies. Thirty-four studies met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The meta-analysis employed a standardized mean difference model. The outcome of this study is to compare intelligence quotient (IQ), motoric ability, and behavioral problems between all ARTs, in vitro fertilization (IVF), intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) to naturally conceived (NC) children. Subdomains of intelligence based on the Cattell, Horn, and Carroll Model (CHC Model) of cognitive architecture, including fluid reasoning, short-term and working memory, processing speed, visual-spatial ability, long-term memory retrieval, and crystalized intelligence (knowledge), were evaluated and summarized in details. Motor skill was stratified into two domains: gross motoric and fine motoric. Behavioral problem was categorized as externalizing and internalizing behavior.Meta-analysis showed that verbal intelligence score in IVF toddlers is significantly lower than NC toddlers (p = 0.02); conversely, ICSI toddlers scored significantly higher verbal intelligence score compared to NC toddlers (p = 0.005). Toddlers born after ART had significantly lower non-verbal intelligence score (p = 0.047). IVF toddlers scored significantly lower fine motor score (p = 0.01) compared to naturally conceived toddlers. Based on parent's CBCL, NC toddlers had higher total (p = 0.01) and externalizing behavior (p = 0.001) scores  compared to ART toddlers. Evaluation of full scale IQ and all domains of intelligence in preschool and primary school children revealed that no significant differences exist between ART and NC children. Based on preschool and primary school parents' CBCL, IVF children had significantly lower externalizing behavior score compared to NC children (p = 0.04). Meta-analyses of studies on young adolescents revealed that ART young adolescents scored higher academically than their NC counterparts, including on mathematics (p < 0.00001) and reading or language (p < 0.00001).Despite differences in certain aspects, this finding suggests that ART is unlikely to cause negative impacts on children's neurodevelopment.© 2023.

Women with GDM and T2D were recruited from a hyperglycemia in pregnancy register, and women with normoglycemia from the community. Wave 1 follow-up included 423 children, aged 1.5-5 years (median follow-up age 2.5 years). Multivariable linear regression assessed associations between maternal antenatal variables, including BMI and glycemic status, with offspring anthropometry (weight, height, BMI, skinfold thicknesses, waist, arm and head circumferences).Greater maternal antenatal BMI was associated with increased anthropometric measures in offspring independent of maternal glycemic status. After adjustment, including for maternal BMI, children exposed to maternal GDM had lower mean weight (-0.54 kg, 95% CI: -0.99, -0.11), BMI (-0.55 kg/m2, 95% CI: -0.91, -0.20), head (-0.52 cm, 95% CI: -0.88, -0.16) and mid-upper arm (-0.32 cm, 95% CI: -0.63, -0.01) circumferences, and greater mean suprailiac skinfold (0.78 mm, 95% CI: 0.13, 1.43), compared to children exposed to normoglycemia. Adjustment for maternal BMI strengthened the negative association between GDM and child weight, BMI and circumferences. Children exposed to maternal T2D had smaller mean head circumference (-0.82 cm, 95% CI: -1.33, -0.31) than children exposed to normoglycemia. Maternal T2D was no longer associated with greater child mean skinfolds (p = 0.14) or waist circumference (p = 0.18) after adjustment for maternal BMI.Children exposed to GDM had greater suprailiac skinfold thickness than unexposed children, despite having lower mean weight, BMI and mid-upper arm circumference, and both GDM and T2D were associated with smaller mean head circumference.

Intrauterine metabolic perturbations can profoundly impact organogenesis in offspring, particularly affecting cardiac development and giving rise to potential structural and functional abnormalities. In this discussion, we contemplate the existing understanding regarding the impact of maternal metabolic disorders, such as obesity, diabetes, or undernutrition, on the developmental and functional aspects of the offspring's heart. This influence has the potential to contribute to the susceptibility of offspring to cardiovascular health issues. Alteration in the nutritional milieu can influence mitochondrial function in the developing hearts of offspring, while also serving as signaling molecules that directly modulate gene expression. Moreover, metabolic disorders can exert influence on cardiac development-related genes epigenetically through DNA methylation, levels of histone modifications, microRNA expression, and other factors. However, the comprehensive understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of these phenomena remains incomplete. Further investigations in this domain hold profound clinical significance, as they can contribute to the enhancement of public health and the prevention of cardiovascular diseases."

Our objective was to investigate whether serum liver enzymes are causally associated with bone and joint-related diseases using Mendelian randomization (MR) designs.Genetic data on serum liver enzymes (alkaline phosphatase (ALP); alanine transaminase (ALT); gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT)) and six common bone and joint-related diseases (rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteoporosis, osteoarthritis (OA), ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, and gout) were derived from independent genome-wide association studies of European ancestry. The inverse variance-weighted (IVW) method was applied for the main causal estimate. Complementary sensitivity analyses and reverse causal analyses were utilized to confirm the robustness of the results.Using the IVW method, the positive causality between ALP and the risk of osteoporosis diagnosed by bone mineral density (BMD) at different sites was indicated (femoral neck, lumbar spine, and total body BMD, odds ratio (OR) [95% CI], 0.40 [0.23-0.69], 0.35 [0.19-0.67], and 0.33 [0.22-0.51], respectively). ALP was also linked to a higher risk of RA (OR [95% CI], 6.26 [1.69-23.51]). Evidence of potential harmful effects of higher levels of ALT on the risk of hip and knee OA was acquired (OR [95% CI], 2.48 [1.39-4.41] and 3.07 [1.49-6.30], respectively).

"37429717",NA,NA,"Early-life stress (ELS) is one of the strongest lifetime risk factors for depression, anxiety, suicide, and other psychiatric disorders, particularly after facing additional stressful events later in life. Human and animal studies demonstrate that ELS sensitizes individuals to subsequent stress. However, the neurobiological basis of such stress sensitization remains largely unexplored. We hypothesized that ELS-induced stress sensitization would be detectable at the level of neuronal ensembles, such that cells activated by ELS would be more reactive to adult stress. To test this, we leveraged transgenic mice to genetically tag, track, and manipulate experience-activated neurons. We found that in both male and female mice, ELS-activated neurons within the nucleus accumbens (NAc), and to a lesser extent the medial prefrontal cortex, were preferentially reactivated by adult stress. To test whether reactivation of ELS-activated ensembles in the NAc contributes to stress hypersensitivity, we expressed hM4Dis receptor in control or ELS-activated neurons of pups and chemogenetically inhibited their activity during experience of adult stress. Inhibition of ELS-activated NAc neurons, but not control-tagged neurons, ameliorated social avoidance behavior following chronic social defeat stress in males. These data provide evidence that ELS-induced stress hypersensitivity is encoded at the level of corticolimbic neuronal ensembles.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTEarly-life stress enhances sensitivity to stress later in life, yet the mechanisms of such stress sensitization are largely unknown. Here, we show that neuronal ensembles in corticolimbic brain regions remain hypersensitive to stress across the life span, and quieting these ensembles during experience of adult stress rescues stress hypersensitivity.Copyright © 2023 the authors."
"37596675","Transposable elements as essential elements in the control of gene expression.","Mob DNA","Interspersed repetitions called transposable elements (TEs), commonly referred to as mobile elements, make up a significant portion of the genomes of higher animals. TEs contribute in controlling the expression of genes locally and even far away at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, which is one of their significant functional effects on gene function and genome evolution. There are different mechanisms through which TEs control the expression of genes. First, TEs offer cis-regulatory regions in the genome with their inherent regulatory features for their own expression, making them potential factors for controlling the expression of the host genes. Promoter and enhancer elements contain cis-regulatory sites generated from TE, which function as binding sites for a variety of trans-acting factors. Second, a significant portion of miRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to have TEs that encode for regulatory RNAs, revealing the TE origin of these RNAs. Furthermore, it was shown that TE sequences are essential for these RNAs' regulatory actions, which include binding to the target mRNA. By being a member of cis-regulatory and regulatory RNA sequences, TEs therefore play essential regulatory roles. Additionally, it has been suggested that TE-derived regulatory RNAs and cis-regulatory regions both contribute to the evolutionary novelty of gene regulation. Additionally, these regulatory systems arising from TE frequently have tissue-specific functions. The objective of this review is to discuss TE-mediated gene regulation, with a particular emphasis on the processes, contributions of various TE types, differential roles of various tissue types, based mostly on recent studies on humans.© 2023.

All pregnant individuals with an expected delivery date between April 1, 2002, and January 31, 2006, were invited to participate. Data were analyzed from February 1 to September 30, 2022.Maternal-reported SSRI use verified by pharmacy records. In mid-pregnancy and 2 and 6 months after delivery, participants reported depressive symptoms using the Brief Symptom Inventory and were divided into 5 groups: SSRI use during pregnancy (n = 41; 80 scans), SSRI use only before pregnancy (n = 77; 126 scans), prenatal depressive symptoms without prenatal SSRI use (n = 257; 477 scans), postnatal depressive symptoms only (n = 74; 128 scans), and nonexposed control individuals (n = 2749; 4813 scans).The main outcome was brain morphometry in offspring, including global and cortical brain volumes, measured at 3 magnetic resonance imaging assessments from 7 to 15 years of age.The study included 3198 mother-child dyads. A total of 3198 mothers (100%) identified as women; mean (SD) age at intake was 31.1 (4.7) years. Children (1670 [52.2%] female) underwent brain imaging assessment from 7 to 15 years of age with 5624 total scans. Most brain gray matter volumes showed an inverted U-shaped trajectory. Compared with nonexposed controls, children prenatally exposed to SSRIs had less cerebral gray matter (β [SE], -20 212.2 [7285.6] mm3; P = .006), particularly within the corticolimbic circuit, which persisted up to 15 years of age. Children exposed to SSRIs prenatally showed a steeper increase in volumes of the amygdala (age interaction: β [SE], 43.3 [13.4] mm3; P = .006) and fusiform gyrus (age interaction: β [SE], 168.3 [51.4] mm3; P = .003) from 7 to 15 years of age. These volumetric differences in the amygdala and fusiform observed in childhood did not persist until early adolescence. Prenatal depression was associated with a smaller volume in the rostral anterior cingulate gyrus (β [SE], -166.3 [65.1] mm3; P = .006), and postnatal depression was associated with a reduced fusiform gyrus (β [SE], -480.5 [189.2] mm3; P = .002). No association of SSRI use before pregnancy with brain outcomes was observed.The results of this cohort study suggest that prenatal SSRI exposure may be associated with altered developmental trajectories of brain regions involved in emotional regulation in offspring. Further research on the functional implications of these findings is needed."
"37541186",NA,NA,"Despite advances in clinical genetic testing, including the introduction of exome sequencing (ES), more than 50% of individuals with a suspected Mendelian condition lack a precise molecular diagnosis. Clinical evaluation is increasingly undertaken by specialists outside of clinical genetics, often occurring in a tiered fashion and typically ending after ES. The current diagnostic rate reflects multiple factors, including technical limitations, incomplete understanding of variant pathogenicity, missing genotype-phenotype associations, complex gene-environment interactions, and reporting differences between clinical labs. Maintaining a clear understanding of the rapidly evolving landscape of diagnostic tests beyond ES, and their limitations, presents a challenge for non-genetics professionals. Newer tests, such as short-read genome or RNA sequencing, can be challenging to order, and emerging technologies, such as optical genome mapping and long-read DNA sequencing, are not available clinically. Furthermore, there is no clear guidance on the next best steps after inconclusive evaluation. Here, we review why a clinical genetic evaluation may be negative, discuss questions to be asked in this setting, and provide a framework for further investigation, including the advantages and disadvantages of new approaches that are nascent in the clinical sphere. We present a guide for the next best steps after inconclusive molecular testing based upon phenotype and prior evaluation, including when to consider referral to research consortia focused on elucidating the underlying cause of rare unsolved genetic disorders.Copyright © 2023 American Society of Human Genetics.

The efficacy on myeloid cell and microglia driven neuroinflammation was determined in the RatMOG EAE. In addition, we assessed the relationship of efficacy to BTK occupancy in tissue, ex vivo T cell response, as well as single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) in brain and spinal cord tissue.Remibrutinib inhibited B cell-dependent HuMOG EAE in dose-dependent manner and strongly reduced neurological symptoms. At the efficacious oral dose of 30 mg/kg, remibrutinib showed strong BTK occupancy in the peripheral immune organs and in the brain of EAE mice. Ex vivo MOG-specific T cell recall response was reduced, but not polyclonal T cell response, indicating absence of non-specific T cell inhibition. Remibrutinib also inhibited RatMOG EAE, suggesting that myeloid cell and microglia inhibition contribute to its efficacy in EAE. Remibrutinib did not reduce B cells, total Ig levels nor MOG-specific antibody response. In brain and spinal cord tissue a clear anti-inflammatory effect in microglia was detected by scRNA-seq. Finally, remibrutinib showed potent inhibition of in vitro immune complex-driven inflammatory response in human microglia.Remibrutinib inhibited EAE models by a two-pronged mechanism based on inhibition of pathogenic B cell autoreactivity, as well as direct anti-inflammatory effects in microglia. Remibrutinib showed efficacy in both models in absence of direct B cell depletion, broad T cell inhibition or reduction of total Ig levels. These findings support the view that remibrutinib may represent a novel treatment option for patients with MS.© 2023. BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature."
"37606688","The role of immunosuppressive myofibroblasts in the aging process and age-related diseases.","J Mol Med (Berl)","Tissue-resident fibroblasts are mesenchymal cells which control the structural integrity of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Fibroblasts possess a remarkable plasticity to allow them to adapt to the changes in the microenvironment and thus maintain tissue homeostasis. Several stresses, also those associated with the aging process, convert quiescent fibroblasts into myofibroblasts which not only display fibrogenic properties but also act as immune regulators cooperating both with tissue-resident immune cells and those immune cells recruited into affected tissues. TGF-β cytokine and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are major inducers of myofibroblast differentiation in pathological conditions either from quiescent fibroblasts or via transdifferentiation from certain other cell types, e.g., macrophages, adipocytes, pericytes, and endothelial cells. Intriguingly, TGF-β and ROS are also important signaling mediators between immunosuppressive cells, such as MDSCs, Tregs, and M2 macrophages. It seems that in pathological states, myofibroblasts are able to interact with the immunosuppressive network. There is clear evidence that a low-grade chronic inflammatory state in aging tissues is counteracted by activation of compensatory immunosuppression. Interestingly, common enhancers of the aging process, such as oxidative stress, loss of DNA integrity, and inflammatory insults, are inducers of myofibroblasts, whereas anti-aging treatments with metformin and rapamycin suppress the differentiation of myofibroblasts and thus prevent age-related tissue fibrosis. I will examine the reciprocal interactions between myofibroblasts and immunosuppressive cells within aging tissues. It seems that the differentiation of myofibroblasts with age-related harmful stresses enhances the activity of the immunosuppressive network which promotes tissue fibrosis and degeneration in elderly individuals.© 2023.

"37591951","KDM6A epigenetically regulates subtype plasticity in small cell lung cancer.","Nat Cell Biol","Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) exists broadly in four molecular subtypes: ASCL1, NEUROD1, POU2F3 and Inflammatory. Initially, SCLC subtypes were thought to be mutually exclusive, but recent evidence shows intra-tumoural subtype heterogeneity and plasticity between subtypes. Here, using a CRISPR-based autochthonous SCLC genetically engineered mouse model to study the consequences of KDM6A/UTX inactivation, we show that KDM6A inactivation induced plasticity from ASCL1 to NEUROD1 resulting in SCLC tumours that express both ASCL1 and NEUROD1. Mechanistically, KDM6A normally maintains an active chromatin state that favours the ASCL1 subtype with its loss decreasing H3K4me1 and increasing H3K27me3 at enhancers of neuroendocrine genes leading to a cell state that is primed for ASCL1-to-NEUROD1 subtype switching. This work identifies KDM6A as an epigenetic regulator that controls ASCL1 to NEUROD1 subtype plasticity and provides an autochthonous SCLC genetically engineered mouse model to model ASCL1 and NEUROD1 subtype heterogeneity and plasticity, which is found in 35-40% of human SCLCs.© 2023.

"37630778","The Microbiome, Epigenome, and Diet in Adults with Obesity during Behavioral Weight Loss.","Nutrients","Obesity has been linked to the gut microbiome, epigenome, and diet, yet these factors have not been studied together during obesity treatment. Our objective was to evaluate associations among gut microbiota (MB), DNA methylation (DNAme), and diet prior to and during a behavioral weight loss intervention. Adults (n= 47, age 40.9 ± 9.7 years, body mass index (BMI) 33.5 ± 4.5 kg/m2, 77% female) with data collected at baseline (BL) and 3 months (3 m) were included. Fecal MB was assessed via 16S sequencing and whole blood DNAme via the Infinium EPIC array. Food group and nutrient intakes and Healthy Eating Index (HEI) scores were calculated from 7-day diet records. Linear models were used to test for the effect of taxa relative abundance on DNAme and diet cross-sectionally at each time point, adjusting for confounders and a false discovery rate of 5%. Mean weight loss was 6.2 ± 3.9% at 3 m. At BL, one MB taxon,Ruminiclostridium, was associated with DNAme of the genesCOL20A1(r = 0.651,p= 0.029),COL18A1(r = 0.578,p= 0.044), andNT5E(r = 0.365,p= 0.043). At 3 m, there were 14 unique MB:DNAme associations, such asAkkermansiawith DNAme ofGUSB(r = -0.585,p= 0.003),CRYL1(r = -0.419,p= 0.007),C9(r = -0.439,p= 0.019), andGMDS(r = -0.559,p= 0.046). Among taxa associated with DNAme, no significant relationships were seen with dietary intakes of relevant nutrients, food groups, or HEI scores. Our findings indicate that microbes linked to mucin degradation, short-chain fatty acid production, and body weight are associated with DNAme of phenotypically relevant genes. These relationships offer an initial understanding of the possible routes by which alterations in gut MB may influence metabolism during weight loss."
"37629043","Epigenetic Regulation in Lean Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.","Int J Mol Sci","Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the most prominent cause of chronic liver disease worldwide, is a rapidly growing epidemic. It consists of a wide range of liver diseases, from steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and predisposes patients to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and even hepatocellular carcinoma. NAFLD is strongly correlated with obesity; however, it has been extensively reported among lean/nonobese individuals in recent years. Although lean patients demonstrate a lower prevalence of diabetes mellitus, central obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome, a percentage of these patients may develop steatohepatitis, advanced liver fibrosis, and cardiovascular disease, and have increased all-cause mortality. The pathophysiological mechanisms of lean NAFLD remain vague. Studies have reported that lean NAFLD demonstrates a close association with environmental factors, genetic predisposition, and epigenetic modifications. In this review, we aim to discuss and summarize the epigenetic mechanisms involved in lean NAFLD and to introduce the interaction between epigenetic patterns and genetic or non genetic factors. Several epigenetic mechanisms have been implicated in the regulation of lean NAFLD. These include DNA methylation, histone modifications, and noncoding-RNA-mediated gene regulation. Epigenetics is an area of special interest in the setting of lean NAFLD as it could provide new insights into the therapeutic options and noninvasive biomarkers that target this under-recognized and challenging disorder."
"37626900","The Transcription Factor HOXA5: Novel Insights into Metabolic Diseases and Adipose Tissue Dysfunction.","Cells","The transcription factorHOXA5, from theHOXgene family, has long been studied due to its critical role in physiological activities in normal cells, such as organ development and body patterning, and pathological activities in cancer cells. Nonetheless, recent evidence supports the hypothesis of a role forHOXA5in metabolic diseases, particularly in obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). In line with the current opinion that adipocyte and adipose tissue (AT) dysfunction belong to the group of primary defects in obesity, linking this condition to an increased risk of insulin resistance (IR) and T2D, theHOXA5gene has been shown to regulate adipocyte function and AT remodeling both in humans and mice. Epigenetics adds complexity toHOXA5gene regulation in metabolic diseases. Indeed, epigenetic mechanisms, specifically DNA methylation, influence the dynamicHOXA5expression profile. In human AT, the DNA methylation profile at theHOXA5gene is associated with hypertrophic obesity and an increased risk of developing T2D. Thus, an inappropriateHOXA5gene expression may be a mechanism causing or maintaining an impaired AT function in obesity and potentially linking obesity to its associated disorders. In this review, we integrate the current evidence about the involvement ofHOXA5in regulating AT function, as well as its association with the pathogenesis of obesity and T2D. We also summarize the current knowledge on the role of DNA methylation in controllingHOXA5expression. Moreover, considering the susceptibility of epigenetic changes to reversal through targeted interventions, we discuss the potential therapeutic value of targetingHOXA5DNA methylation changes in the treatment of metabolic diseases."

Developing and implementing effective preventive strategies is the best way to ensure the overall metabolic health status of the population and to counter the global burden of non-communicable diseases. Predisposition to obesity and other non-communicable diseases is due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors throughout life, but the early environment, particularly the environment during the fetal period and the early years of life, is crucial in determining metabolic health, hence the concept of 'fetal programming'. The origins of this causal link between environmental factors and disease lie in epigenetic mechanisms. Among the environmental factors, diet plays a crucial role in this process. Substantial evidence documented the key role of macronutrients in the programming of metabolic diseases early in life. Recently, the effect of maternal micronutrient intake on offspring metabolic health in later life emerged. The purpose of this narrative review is to bring to light available evidence in the literature on the effect of maternal micronutrient status on offspring metabolic health and underlying epigenetic mechanisms that drive this link to highlight its potential role in the prevention of non-communicable diseases.© 2023.

Samples were collected 7 days before DI, at day 7, 14, and 21 during DI, and 7 days after DI. RNA sequencing of CD3+T cells revealed transcriptional alterations across all time points, with most changes occurring 14 days after DI exposure. At day 21, T cells showed evidence of adaptation with a transcriptional profile resembling that of 7 days before DI. At 7 days after DI, T cells again changed their transcriptional profile. These data suggest that T cells adapt by rewiring their transcriptomes in response to simulated weightlessness and that remodeling cues persist when reexposed to normal gravity."

In this regard, numerous studies have shown that changes in DNA methylation levels can be used to distinguish between healthy individuals and those with SLE and RA, as well as to predict disease activity and prognosis.In the current study, we evaluated quantitative methylation level of CDKN2A promoter in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of SLE and RA patients, and healthy controls by methylation-quantification of endonuclease-resistant DNA (MethyQESD), a bisulfite conversion-independent method.Our findings revealed an excessive hypomethylation of CDKN2A in SLE and RA patients compared to healthy individuals (P < 0.001). Besides, by determining efficient cutoff value, the specificity of CDKN2A for correct diagnosis of healthy subjects was measured to be 77.30% and the sensitivity for SLE and RA diagnosis were 81.33%, and 72%, respectively. Furthermore, CDKN2A methylation level was shown to be positively associated with C3 and C4 levels and negatively associated with anti‑dsDNA concentration (P < 0.001). Moreover, a statistically significant difference in the DNA methylation levels of CDKN2A promoter was identified between SLE cases with age of ≤ 18 and patients with > 18 years of age (P = 0.025).Our findings demonstrated that CDKN2A methylation levels in PBMCs of SLE and RA patients could be used as a promising diagnostic biomarker. The significant association between hypomethylation of CDKN2A promoter and disease activity factors in SLE patients, is suggesting that CDKN2A hypomethylation could be used as an alternative biomarker for assessment of disease activity. Key Points • Several studies have reported increased expression of CDKN2A in SLE and RA suggesting that it may be involved in the pathogenesis of these disorders. • CDKN2A hypomethylation has been implicated in different autoimmune diseases. • Our findings demonstrated that CDKN2A methylation levels in PBMCs of SLE and RA patients could be used as a promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarker.© 2023.

"37660055","TAZ2 truncation confers overactivation of p300 and cellular vulnerability to HDAC inhibition.","Nat Commun","The histone acetyltransferase p300/CBP is composed of several conserved domains, among which, the TAZ2 domain is known as a protein-protein interaction domain that binds to E1A and various transcription factors. Here we show that TAZ2 has a HAT autoinhibitory function. Truncating p300/CBP at TAZ2 leads to hyperactive HAT and elevated histone H3K27 and H3K18 acetylation in cells. Mechanistically, TAZ2 cooperates with other HAT neighboring domains to maintain the HAT active site in a 'closed' state. Truncating TAZ2 or binding of transcription factors to TAZ2 induces a conformational change that 'opens' the active site for substrate acetylation. Importantly, genetic mutations that lead to p300/CBP TAZ2 truncations are found in human cancers, and cells with TAZ2 truncations are vulnerable to histone deacetylase inhibitors. Our study reveals a function of the TAZ2 domain in HAT autoinhibitory regulation and provides a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cancers harboring p300/CBP TAZ2 truncations.© 2023.

However, in vivo functions of TERT reactivation in cancer progression and the underlying mechanism are not fully understood. In this study, we expressed TERT and/or active BRAF (BRAFV600E) specifically in mouse thyroid epithelium. WhileBRAFV600E alone induced papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), coexpression ofBRAFV600E and TERT resulted in poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (PDTC). Spatial transcriptome analysis revealed that tumors from mice coexpressingBRAFV600E and TERT were highly heterogeneous, and cell dedifferentiation was positively correlated with ribosomal biogenesis. Mechanistically, TERT boosted ribosomal RNA (rRNA) expression and protein synthesis by interacting with multiple proteins involved in ribosomal biogenesis. Furthermore, we found that CX-5461, an rRNA transcription inhibitor, effectively blocked proliferation and induced redifferentiation of thyroid cancer. Thus, TERT promotes thyroid cancer progression by inducing cancer cell dedifferentiation, and ribosome inhibition represents a potential strategy to treat TERT-reactivated cancers."
"37645963","Multi-omic stratification of the missense variant cysteinome.","bioRxiv","Cancer genomes are rife with genetic variants; one key outcome of this variation is gain-of-cysteine, which is the most frequently acquired amino acid due to missense variants in COSMIC. Acquired cysteines are both driver mutations and sites targeted by precision therapies. However, despite their ubiquity, nearly all acquired cysteines remain uncharacterized. Here, we pair cysteine chemoproteomics-a technique that enables proteome-wide pinpointing of functional, redox sensitive, and potentially druggable residues-with genomics to reveal the hidden landscape of cysteine acquisition. For both cancer and healthy genomes, we find that cysteine acquisition is a ubiquitous consequence of genetic variation that is further elevated in the context of decreased DNA repair. Our chemoproteogenomics platform integrates chemoproteomic, whole exome, and RNA-seq data, with a customized 2-stage false discovery rate (FDR) error controlled proteomic search, further enhanced with a user-friendly FragPipe interface. Integration of CADD predictions of deleteriousness revealed marked enrichment for likely damaging variants that result in acquisition of cysteine. By deploying chemoproteogenomics across eleven cell lines, we identify 116 gain-of-cysteines, of which 10 were liganded by electrophilic druglike molecules. Reference cysteines proximal to missense variants were also found to be pervasive, 791 in total, supporting heretofore untapped opportunities for proteoform-specific chemical probe development campaigns.

While abnormal lncRNA expression is associated with colon cancer development, the prognostic potential and biological characteristics of disulfidptosis-related lncRNAs (DRLs) remain unclear. Consequently, the research aimed to discover a novel indication of DRLs with significant prognostic implications, and to investigate their possible molecular role in the advancement of colon cancer. Here, we acquired RNA-seq data, pertinent clinical data, and genomic mutations of colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) from the TCGA database, and then DRLs were determined through Pearson correlation analysis. A total of 434 COAD patients were divided in to three subgroups through clustering analysis based on DRLs. By utilizing univariate Cox regression, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm, and multivariate Cox regression analysis, we ultimately created a prognostic model consisting of four DRLs (AC007728.3, AP003555.1, ATP2B1.AS1, and NSMCE1.DT), and an external database was used to validate the prognostic features of the risk model. According to the Kaplan-Meier curve analysis, patients in the low-risk group exhibited a considerably superior survival time in comparison to those in the high-risk group. Enrichment analysis revealed a significant association between metabolic processes and the genes that were differentially expressed in the high- and low-risk groups. Additionally, significant differences in the tumor immune microenvironment landscape were observed, specifically pertaining to immune cells, function, and checkpoints. High-risk patients exhibited a low likelihood of immune evasion, as indicated by the Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) analysis. Patients who exhibit both a high risk and high Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) experience the least amount of time for survival, whereas those belonging to the low-risk and low-TMB category demonstrate the most favorable prognosis. In addition, the risk groups determined by the 4-DRLs signature displayed distinct drug sensitivities. Finally, we confirmed the levels of expression for four DRLs through rt-qPCR in both tissue samples from colon cancer patients and cell lines. Taken together, the first 4-DRLs-based signature we proposed may serve for a hopeful instrument for forecasting the prognosis, immune landscape, and therapeutic responses in colon cancer patients, thereby facilitating optimal clinical decision-making."
"37627150","Luciferase Expressing Preclinical Model Systems Representing the Different Molecular Subtypes of Colorectal Cancer.","Cancers (Basel)","Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a heterogeneous disease. More insight into the biological diversity of CRC is needed to improve therapeutic outcomes. Established CRC cell lines are frequently used and were shown to be representative models of the main subtypes of CRC at the genomic and transcriptomic level. In the present work, we established stable, luciferase expressing derivatives from 10 well-established CRC cell lines, generated spheroids and subcutaneous xenograft tumors in nude mice, and performed comparative characterization of these model systems. Transcriptomic analyses revealed the close relation of cell lines with their derived spheroids and xenograft tumors. The preclinical model systems clustered with patient tumor samples when compared to normal tissue thereby confirming that cell-line-based tumor models retain specific characteristics of primary tumors. Xenografts showed different differentiation patterns and bioluminescence imaging revealed metastatic spread to the lungs. In addition, the models were classified according to the CMS classification system, with further sub-classification according to the recently identified two intrinsic epithelial tumor cell states of CRC, iCMS2 and iCMS3. The combined data showed that regarding primary tumor characteristics, 3D-spheroid cultures resemble xenografts more closely than 2D-cultured cells do. Furthermore, we set up a bioluminescence-based spheroid cytotoxicity assay in order to be able to perform dose-response relationship studies in analogy to typical monolayer assays. Applying the established assay, we studied the efficacy of oxaliplatin. Seven of the ten used cell lines showed a significant reduction in the response to oxaliplatin in the 3D-spheroid model compared to the 2D-monolayer model. Therapy studies in selected xenograft models confirmed the response or lack of response to oxaliplatin treatment. Analyses of differentially expressed genes in these models identified CAV1 as a possible marker of oxaliplatin resistance. In conclusion, we established a combined 2D/3D, in vitro/in vivo model system representing the heterogeneity of CRC, which can be used in preclinical research applications."

This work prioritized SV gene pairs based on CRISPR/Cas9 screens. SV gene pairs signature were constructed to predict the response to ICI for melanoma patients.This study predicted robust SV gene pairs based on 14 features. Filtered by CRISPR/Cas9 screens, we identified 1,861 SV gene pairs, which were also related with prognosis across multiple cancer types. Next, we constructed the six SV pairs signature to predict resistance to ICI for melanoma patients. This study applied the six SV pairs signature to divide melanoma patients into high-risk and low-risk. High-risk melanoma patients were associated with worse response after ICI treatment. Immune landscape analysis revealed that high-risk melanoma patients had lower natural killer cells and CD8+T cells infiltration.In summary, the 14 features classifier accurately predicted robust SV gene pairs for cancer.

"37612728","Partial gene suppression improves identification of cancer vulnerabilities when CRISPR-Cas9 knockout is pan-lethal.","Genome Biol","Hundreds of functional genomic screens have been performed across a diverse set of cancer contexts, as part of efforts such as the Cancer Dependency Map, to identify gene dependencies-genes whose loss of function reduces cell viability or fitness. Recently, large-scale screening efforts have shifted from RNAi to CRISPR-Cas9, due to superior efficacy and specificity. However, many effective oncology drugs only partially inhibit their protein targets, leading us to question whether partial suppression of genes using RNAi could reveal cancer vulnerabilities that are missed by complete knockout using CRISPR-Cas9. Here, we compare CRISPR-Cas9 and RNAi dependency profiles of genes across approximately 400 matched cancer cell lines.We find that CRISPR screens accurately identify more gene dependencies per cell line, but the majority of each cell line's dependencies are part of a set of 1867 genes that are shared dependencies across the entire collection (pan-lethals). While RNAi knockdown of about 30% of these genes is also pan-lethal, approximately 50% have selective dependency patterns across cell lines, suggesting they could still be cancer vulnerabilities. The accuracy of the unique RNAi selectivity is supported by associations to multi-omics profiles, drug sensitivity, and other expected co-dependencies.Incorporating RNAi data for genes that are pan-lethal knockouts facilitates the discovery of a wider range of gene targets than could be detected using the CRISPR dataset alone. This can aid in the interpretation of contrasting results obtained from CRISPR and RNAi screens and reinforce the importance of partial gene suppression methods in building a cancer dependency map.© 2023.

"37591722","A novel antifolate suppresses growth of FPGS-deficient cells and overcomes methotrexate resistance.","Life Sci Alliance","Cancer cells make extensive use of the folate cycle to sustain increased anabolic metabolism. Multiple chemotherapeutic drugs interfere with the folate cycle, including methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil that are commonly applied for the treatment of leukemia and colorectal cancer (CRC), respectively. Despite high success rates, therapy-induced resistance causes relapse at later disease stages. Depletion of folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS), which normally promotes intracellular accumulation and activity of natural folates and methotrexate, is linked to methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil resistance and its association with relapse illustrates the need for improved intervention strategies. Here, we describe a novel antifolate (C1) that, like methotrexate, potently inhibits dihydrofolate reductase and downstream one-carbon metabolism. Contrary to methotrexate, C1 displays optimal efficacy in FPGS-deficient contexts, due to decreased competition with intracellular folates for interaction with dihydrofolate reductase. We show that FPGS-deficient patient-derived CRC organoids display enhanced sensitivity to C1, whereas FPGS-high CRC organoids are more sensitive to methotrexate. Our results argue that polyglutamylation-independent antifolates can be applied to exert selective pressure on FPGS-deficient cells during chemotherapy, using a vulnerability created by polyglutamylation deficiency.© 2023 van der Krift et al."
"37578979","Deconvolution of cancer cell states by the XDec-SM method.","PLoS Comput Biol","Proper characterization of cancer cell states within the tumor microenvironment is a key to accurately identifying matching experimental models and the development of precision therapies. To reconstruct this information from bulk RNA-seq profiles, we developed the XDec Simplex Mapping (XDec-SM) reference-optional deconvolution method that maps tumors and the states of constituent cells onto a biologically interpretable low-dimensional space. The method identifies gene sets informative for deconvolution from relevant single-cell profiling data when such profiles are available. When applied to breast tumors in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), XDec-SM infers the identity of constituent cell types and their proportions. XDec-SM also infers cancer cells states within individual tumors that associate with DNA methylation patterns, driver somatic mutations, pathway activation and metabolic coupling between stromal and breast cancer cells. By projecting tumors, cancer cell lines, and PDX models onto the same map, we identify in vitro and in vivo models with matching cancer cell states. Map position is also predictive of therapy response, thus opening the prospects for precision therapy informed by experiments in model systems matched to tumors in vivo by cancer cell state.Copyright: © 2023 Murillo et al.

We independently confirm the predictive power of CD10, CD20, CD38, and CD45 as biomarkers for ALL diagnosis. Based on our analyses, we propose three increasingly detailed prognostic pipelines for analysing flow cytometry data from ALL patients depending on technical and technological availability: 1. Visual inspection of specific biological features in biparametric projections of the data; 2. Computation of quantitative topological descriptors of such projections; 3. A combined analysis, using TDA and ML, in the four-parameter space defined by CD10, CD20, CD38 and CD45. Our analyses readily extend to other haematological malignancies.Copyright: © 2023 Chulián et al.

MRPs have a role in the progression of many cancers. However, the role ofMRPL19in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is yet unknown.The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were used to assessMRPL19expression and clinical relevance. Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) and the online Kaplan-Meier (KM) Plotter database were used to determine the prognostic significance. Through use of LinkedOmics, genes that were coexpressed withMRPL19and its regulators were identified. The biological roles ofMRPL19were investigated through R-implemented packages and RNA interference. The Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) was employed to assess the connection betweenMRPL19expression and infiltrated immune cells in LUAD.MRPL19expression in LUAD was upregulated and was correlated with lymph node metastasis, differentiation level, and tumor status.MRPL19was prognostic and associated with poor prognosis. Functional network analysis revealed thatMRPL19may be associated with the cell cycle, cell adhesion molecules, spliceosome, and T-helper cell differentiation and was regulated by several microRNA and the E2F family. The gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network indicated thatMRPL19was correlated with cancer proliferation signaling pathways. The immune infiltration analysis revealed a correlation betweenMRPL19expression and the extent of B cells, CD4+T cells, and dendritic cells' infiltration in LUAD. Additionally,MRPL19knockdown in LUAD cells substantially reduced cell growth, migration, and invasion of malignant cells.The poor prognosis and immunological infiltration in LUAD were significantly associated withMRPL19, which may have pro-oncogenic effects on the disease.2023 Translational Lung Cancer Research.

"37572177","Tumoral P2Y(2) receptor modulates tumor growth and host anti-tumor immune responses in a syngeneic murine model of oral cancer.","Purinergic Signal","Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) are a heterogenous group of tumors and among the top 10 most common cancers and they arise from the epithelial tissues of the mucosal surfaces of the oral cavity, oropharynx, and larynx. Aberrant purinergic signaling has been associated with various cancer types. Here, we studied the role of the P2Y2purinergic receptor (P2Y2R) in the context of oral cancer. We utilized bioinformatics analysis of deposited datasets to examine purinome gene expression in HNSCC tumors and cells lines and functionally characterized nucleotide-induced P2 receptor signaling in human FaDu and Cal27 and murine MOC2 oral cancer cell lines. Utilizing tumorigenesis assays with wild-type or P2ry2 knockout MOC2 cells we evaluated the role of P2Y2Rs in tumor growth and the host anti-tumor immune responses. Our data demonstrate that human and murine oral cancer cell lines express numerous P2 receptors, with the P2Y2R being highly expressed. Using syngeneic tumor grafts in wild-type mice, we observed that MOC2 tumors expressing P2Y2R were larger than P2Y2R-/-tumors. Wild-type MOC2 tumors contained a lower population of tumor-infiltrating CD11b+F4/80+macrophages and CD3+ cells, which were revealed to be CD3+CD4+IFNγ+T cells, compared to P2Y2R-/-tumors. These results were mirrored when utilizing P2Y2R-/-mice, indicating that the changes in MOC2 tumor growth and to the host anti-tumor immune response were independent of host derived P2Y2Rs. Results suggest that targeted suppression of the P2Y2R in HNSCC cells in vivo, rather than systemic P2Y2R antagonism, may be a more effective treatment strategy for HNSCCs.© 2023.

The aim of our study was to clarify the role ofFoxP3in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) progression and metastasis. We verified theFoxP3characteristic clinicopathological data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database using bioinformatics tools. Meanwhile, RNA sequencing was performed to determine theFoxP3biofunction in RCC progression. Our results showed that high expression ofFoxP3was found inBAP1- orSETD2-mutant patients with RCC, and a higherFoxP3expression was related to worse prognosis. However, there was no statistically significant relationship between theFoxP3IHC score and RCC malignant progression owning to the limited number of patients in our tissue microarray. Using in vitroFoxP3loss-of-function assays, we verified that silencingFoxP3in 786-O and ACHN cells could inhibit the cell migration/invasion capability, which was consistent with the data from RNA sequencing in 786-O cells and from the TCGA datasets. Using an in vivo nude mice orthotopic kidney cancer model, we found that silencingFoxP3could inhibit tumor growth. In conclusion, our study demonstrated thatBAP1orSEDT2mutation could lead to higher expression ofFoxP3in RCC patients, andFoxP3could eventually stimulate RCC cells' invasion and metastasis, which might indicate thatFoxP3could function as a potential oncogene in RCC progression."

While various (epi) genomic alterations associated with tumor development in ESCC and EAC have been documented, a comprehensive comparison of the transcriptomes in these two cancer subtypes remains lacking.We collected 551 gene expression profiles from publicly available sources, including normal, ESCC, and EAC tissues or cell lines. Subsequently, we conducted a systematic analysis to compare the transcriptomes of these samples at various levels, including gene expression, promoter activity, alternative splicing (AS), alternative polyadenylation (APA), and gene fusion.Seven distinct cluster gene expression patterns were identified among the differentially expressed genes in normal, ESCC, and EAC tissues. These patterns were enriched in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and the activation of extracellular matrix organization and exhibited repression of epidermal development. Notably, we observed additional genes or unique expression levels enriched in these shared pathways and biological processes related to tumor development and immune activation. In addition to the differentially expressed genes, there was an enrichment of lncRNA co-expression networks and downregulation of promoter activity associated with the repression of epidermal development in both ESCC and EAC. This indicates a common feature between these two cancer subtypes. Furthermore, differential AS and APA patterns in ESCC and EAC appear to partially affect the expression of host genes associated with bacterial or viral infections in these subtypes. No gene fusions were observed between ESCC and EAC, thus highlighting the distinct molecular mechanisms underlying these two cancer subtypes.We conducted a comprehensive comparison of ESCC and EAC transcriptomes and uncovered shared and distinct transcriptomic signatures at multiple levels. These findings suggest that ESCC and EAC may exhibit common and unique mechanisms involved in tumorigenesis.© 2023 The Authors.

"37558831",NA,NA,"Aberrant DNA methylation accompanies genetic alterations during oncogenesis and tumour homeostasis and contributes to the transcriptional deregulation of key signalling pathways in cancer. Despite increasing efforts in DNA methylation profiling of cancer patients, there is still a lack of epigenetic biomarkers to predict treatment efficacy. To address this, we analyse 721 cancer cell lines across 22 cancer types treated with 453 anti-cancer compounds. We systematically detect the predictive component of DNA methylation in the context of transcriptional and mutational patterns, i.e., in total 19 DNA methylation biomarkers across 17 drugs and five cancer types. DNA methylation constitutes drug sensitivity biomarkers by mediating the expression of proximal genes, thereby enhancing biological signals across multi-omics data modalities. Our method reproduces anticipated associations, and in addition, we find that the NEK9 promoter hypermethylation may confer sensitivity to the NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE) inhibitor pevonedistat in melanoma through downregulation of NEK9. In summary, we envision that epigenomics will refine existing patient stratification, thus empowering the next generation of precision oncology.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."
"37554444","The SWI/SNF complex member SMARCB1 supports lineage fidelity in kidney cancer.","iScience","Lineage switching can induce therapy resistance in cancer. Yet, how lineage fidelity is maintained and how it can be lost remain poorly understood. Here, we have used CRISPR-Cas9-based genetic screening to demonstrate that loss of SMARCB1, a member of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, can confer an advantage to clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) cells upon inhibition of the renal lineage factor PAX8. Lineage factor inhibition-resistant ccRCC cells formed tumors with morphological features, but not molecular markers, of neuroendocrine differentiation. SMARCB1 inactivation led to large-scale loss of kidney-specific epigenetic programs and restoration of proliferative capacity through the adoption of new dependencies on factors that represent rare essential genes across different cancers. We further developed an analytical approach to systematically characterize lineage fidelity using large-scale CRISPR-Cas9 data. An understanding of the rules that govern lineage switching could aid the development of more durable lineage factor-targeted and other cancer therapies.© 2023 The Author(s)."
"37546802","Ribosome subunit attrition and activation of the p53-MDM4 axis dominate the response of MLL-rearranged cancer cells to WDR5 WIN site inhibition.","bioRxiv","The chromatin-associated protein WDR5 is a promising target for cancer drug discovery, with most efforts blocking an arginine-binding cavity on the protein called the ""WIN"" site that tethers WDR5 to chromatin. WIN site inhibitors (WINi) are active against multiple cancer cell types in vitro, the most notable of which are those derived from MLL-rearranged (MLLr) leukemias. Peptidomimetic WINi were originally proposed to inhibit MLLr cells via dysregulation of genes connected to hematopoetic stem cell expansion. Our discovery and interrogation of small molecule WIN site inhibitors, however, revealed that they act in MLLr cell lines to suppress ribosome protein gene (RPG) transcription, induce nucleolar stress, and activate p53. Because there is no precedent for an anti-cancer strategy that specifically targets RPG expression, we took an integrated multi-omics approach to further interrogate the mechanism of action of WINi in MLLr cancer cells. We show that WINi induce depletion of the stock of ribosomes, accompanied by a broad translational choke, induction of a DNA damage response, and changes in alternative mRNA splicing that inactivate the p53 antagonist MDM4. We also show that WINi are synergistic with agents including venetoclax and BET-bromodomain inhibitors. Together, these studies reinforce the concept that WINi are a novel type of ribosome-directed anti-cancer therapy and provide a resource to support their clinical implementation in MLLr leukemias and other malignancies."
"37544034","APE1 promotes radiation resistance against radiation-induced pyroptosis by inhibiting the STING pathway in lung adenocarcinoma.","Transl Oncol","Mammalian apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1, APEX1) is a multifunctional enzyme that maintains cellular homeostasis. It is involved in the base excision repair (BER) pathway and plays a key role in radiation-induced DNA damage response. However, the relationship between APE1-driven radiation resistance and pyroptosis in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cells and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We found that APE1 was significantly upregulated in LUAD tissues compared to para-carcinoma tissues and promoted the proliferation and invasion of LUAD cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, APE1 inhibited pyroptosis by inactivating the interferon gene stimulator (STING) pathway via direct interaction with AIM2 and DDX41, as detected by RNA-seq and co-immunoprecipitation. APE1 protects LUAD cells against radiation-induced damage and induces radio-resistance by targeting the STING pathway. It can induce pyroptosis and is negatively regulated by interactions with AIM2 and DDX41. Therefore, APE1 inhibitors should be considered to enhance the radiosensitivity of LUAD cells and improve patient prognosis and therapeutic outcomes. Thus, APE1 play a role in the tumor immune microenvironment and in tumor immunotherapy.Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier Inc."

To identify potential strategies for treating these high-risk pediatric patients, we performed in vitro screening of 125 patient-derived samples against a library of 126 anticancer drugs. Tumor cell expansion did not influence drug responses, and 82% of the screens on expanded tumor cells were completed while the patients were still under clinical care. High-throughput drug screening (HTS) confirmed known associations between activating genomic alterations in NTRK, BRAF, and ALK and responses to matching targeted drugs. The in vitro results were further validated in patient-derived xenograft models in vivo and were consistent with clinical responses in treated patients. In addition, effective combinations could be predicted by correlating sensitivity profiles between drugs. Furthermore, molecular integration with HTS identified biomarkers of sensitivity to WEE1 and MEK inhibition. Incorporating HTS into precision medicine programs is a powerful tool to accelerate the improved identification of effective biomarker-driven therapeutic strategies for treating high-risk pediatric cancers.Integrating HTS with molecular profiling is a powerful tool for expanding precision medicine to support drug treatment recommendations and broaden the therapeutic options available to high-risk pediatric cancers.©2023 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research."
"37488358","Collateral lethality between HDAC1 and HDAC2 exploits cancer-specific NuRD complex vulnerabilities.","Nat Struct Mol Biol","Transcriptional co-regulators have been widely pursued as targets for disrupting oncogenic gene regulatory programs. However, many proteins in this target class are universally essential for cell survival, which limits their therapeutic window. Here we unveil a genetic interaction between histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and HDAC2, wherein each paralog is synthetically lethal with hemizygous deletion of the other. This collateral synthetic lethality is caused by recurrent chromosomal deletions that occur in diverse solid and hematological malignancies, including neuroblastoma and multiple myeloma. Using genetic disruption or dTAG-mediated degradation, we show that targeting HDAC2 suppresses the growth of HDAC1-deficient neuroblastoma in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we find that targeted degradation of HDAC2 in these cells prompts the degradation of several members of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex, leading to diminished chromatin accessibility at HDAC2-NuRD-bound sites of the genome and impaired control of enhancer-associated transcription. Furthermore, we reveal that several of the degraded NuRD complex subunits are dependencies in neuroblastoma and multiple myeloma, providing motivation to develop paralog-selective HDAC1 or HDAC2 degraders that could leverage HDAC1/2 synthetic lethality to target NuRD vulnerabilities. Altogether, we identify HDAC1/2 collateral synthetic lethality as a potential therapeutic target and reveal an unexplored mechanism for targeting NuRD-associated cancer dependencies.© 2023.

Therefore, discovering the drivers and therapeutic targets of LNM is important for early and non-invasive detection of patients with a high risk of LNM and guiding individualized therapy. Various cell constitutions of the primary tumor and lymph node microenvironment was characterized based on scRNA-seq data. The copy number variation (CNV) analysis was performed to probe clonal structures and origins of metastatic lymph nodes, and found 6q loss and 20q gain may drive LNM in LUAD. Then a LNM-related cell subset, named Scissor+ cells, was identified using the Scissor algorithm. And cell-cell communication network among Scissor+ cells and microenvironment was further analyzed. Besides, a pro-LNM signature was subsequently constructed based on 27 genes using pseudotime trajectory analysis and gene set variation analysis. The pro-LNM signature showed a significant correlation withNstage and a good predictive ability of LUAD survival. At last, we identified that erastin and gefitinib could potentially inhibit LNM by targeting Scissor+ cells based on the drug sensitivity data of the cancer cell lines, which provided new insights for LUAD therapy."

ARTHS is clinically heterogeneous and characterized by several common features including intellectual disability, developmental and speech delay, hypotonia and affects multiple organ systems.KAT6Ais highly expressed in early development and plays a key role in cell-type specific differentiation. KAT6A is the enzymatic core of a histone-acetylation protein complex, however the direct histone targets and gene regulatory effects remain unknown. In this study, we use ARTHS patient (n=8) and control (n=14) dermal fibroblasts and perform comprehensive profiling of the epigenome and transcriptome caused byKAT6Amutations. We identified differential chromatin accessibility within the promoter or gene body of 23%(14/60) of genes that were differentially expressed between ARTHS and controls. Within fibroblasts, we show a distinct set of genes from the posteriorHOXCgene cluster (HOXC10,HOXC11,HOXC-AS3, HOXC-AS2, HOTAIR) that are overexpressed in ARTHS and are transcription factors critical for early development body segment patterning. The genomic loci harboring HOXC genes are epigenetically regulated with increased chromatin accessibility, high levels of H3K23ac, and increased gene-body DNA methylation compared to controls, all of which are consistent with transcriptomic overexpression. Finally, we used unbiased proteomic mass spectrometry and identified two new histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) that are disrupted in ARTHS: H2A and H3K56 acetylation. Our multi-omics assays have identified novel histone and gene regulatory roles ofKAT6Ain a large group of ARTHS patients harboring diverse pathogenic mutations. This work provides insight into the role of KAT6A on the epigenomic regulation in somatic cell types."

Several potential biomarkers of LAA, mainly related to lipidic pathways and inflammation, have been studied. Diagnostic biomarkers of LAA were evaluated by measuring biomarkers levels in patients with LAA stroke and other stroke etiologies. Some biomarkers were associated with the functional prognosis of LAA stroke patients. Increased levels of IL-6 and sLOX-1 were associated with a risk of progression of carotid atherosclerotic disease. Findings support the notion that the immune system plays a central role in the pathogenesis of LAA. Overall, in most studies, results were not externally validated. In the future, biomarkers could be useful for the selection of patients for clinical trials.

"37601094","Post-translational modifications and protein quality control of mitochondrial channels and transporters.","Front Cell Dev Biol","Mitochondria play a critical role in energy metabolism and signal transduction, which is tightly regulated by proteins, metabolites, and ion fluxes. Metabolites and ion homeostasis are mainly mediated by channels and transporters present on mitochondrial membranes. Mitochondria comprise two distinct compartments, the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) and the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM), which have differing permeabilities to ions and metabolites. The OMM is semipermeable due to the presence of non-selective molecular pores, while the IMM is highly selective and impermeable due to the presence of specialized channels and transporters which regulate ion and metabolite fluxes. These channels and transporters are modulated by various post-translational modifications (PTMs), including phosphorylation, oxidative modifications, ions, and metabolites binding, glycosylation, acetylation, and others. Additionally, the mitochondrial protein quality control (MPQC) system plays a crucial role in ensuring efficient molecular flux through the mitochondrial membranes by selectively removing mistargeted or defective proteins. Inefficient functioning of the transporters and channels in mitochondria can disrupt cellular homeostasis, leading to the onset of various pathological conditions.

Here we show that a subset of young LINE-1s, L1Md_Ts, are marked by the RNA polymerase II elongation factor ELL3, and function as enhancers in mouse embryonic stem cells. ELL3 depletion dislodges the DNA hydroxymethylase TET1 and the co-repressor SIN3A from L1Md_Ts, but increases the enrichment of the Bromodomain protein BRD4, leading to loss of 5hmC, gain of H3K27ac, and upregulation of the L1Md_T nearby genes. Specifically, ELL3 occupies and represses the L1Md_T-based enhancer located within Akt3, which encodes a key regulator of AKT pathway. ELL3 is required for proper ERK activation and efficient shutdown of naïve pluripotency through inhibiting Akt3 during naïve-primed transition.

However, the presence of strong inter-tumor heterogeneity often obscures more subtle patterns that are shared across tumors, some of which may characterize clinically-relevant disease subtypes. Here we introduce a new statistical method to address this problem. We show that this method can help decompose transcriptional heterogeneity into interpretable components - including patient-specific, dataset-specific and shared components relevant to disease subtypes - and that, in the presence of strong inter-tumor heterogeneity, our method can produce more interpretable results than existing widely-used methods. Applied to data from three studies on pancreatic cancer adenocarcinoma (PDAC), our method produces a refined characterization of existing tumor subtypes (e.g. classical vs basal), and identifies a new gene expression program (GEP) that is prognostic of poor survival independent of established prognostic factors such as tumor stage and subtype. The new GEP is enriched for genes involved in a variety of stress responses, and suggests a potentially important role for the integrated stress response in PDAC development and prognosis."

In this study, we explored the underlying molecular mechanism that is dysregulated in both diseases.Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) was executed with the SLE and BRCA datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) website and identified the potential role of membrane metalloendopeptidase (MME) in both diseases. Then, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses of related proteins and miRNAs were performed to investigate the potential molecular pathways.WGCNA revealed that MME was positively related to SLE but negatively related to BRCA. In BRCA, MME expression was significantly decreased in tumor tissues, especially in luminal B and infiltrating ductal carcinoma subtypes. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis identified MME as a valuable diagnostic biomarker of BRCA, with an area under the curve (AUC) value equal to 0.984 (95% confidence interval = 0.976-0.992). KEGG enrichment analysis suggested that MME-related proteins and targeted miRNAs may reduce the incidence of BRCA in SLE patients via the PI3K/AKT/FOXO signaling pathway. Low MME expression was associated with favorable relapse-free survival (RFS) but no other clinical outcomes and may contribute to resistance to chemotherapy in BRCA, with an AUC equal to 0.527 (P value < 0.05).In summary, MME expression was significantly decreased in BRCA but positively correlated with SLE, and it might reduce the incidence of BRCA in SLE patients via the PI3K/AKT/FOXO signaling pathway.Copyright: © 2023 Ding et al.

"37575241","Prognostic value and immune landscapes of TERT promoter methylation in triple negative breast cancer.","Front Immunol","Treatment options for patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remain limited to mainstay therapies owing to a lack of efficacious therapeutic targets. Accordingly, there is an urgent need to discover and identify novel molecular targets for the treatment and diagnosis of this disease. In this study, we analyzed the correlation of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) methylation status with TERT expression, prognosis, and immune infiltration in TNBC and identified the role of TERT methylation in the regulation TNBC prognosis and immunotherapy.Data relating to the transcriptome, clinicopathological characteristics and methylation of TNBC patients were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. TERT expression levels and differential methylation sites (DMSs) were detected. The correlations between TERT expression and DMSs were calculated. Kaplan-Meier curves was plotted to analyze the relationship between the survival of TNBC patients and the DMSs. The correlations of DMSs and TERT expression with several immunological characteristics of immune microenvironment (immune cell infiltration, immunomodulators, immune-related biological pathways, and immune checkpoints) were assessed. The results were validated using 40 TNBC patients from Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (SYSUCC).Six DMSs were identified. Among them, four sites (cg11625005, cg07380026, cg17166338, and cg26006951) were within the TERT promoter, in which two sites (cg07380026 and cg26006951) were significantly related to the prognosis of patients with TNBC. Further validation using 40 TNBC samples from SYSUCC showed that the high methylation of the cg26006951 CpG site was associated with poor survival prognosis (P=0.0022). TERT expression was significantly correlated with pathological N stage and clinical stage, and cg07380026 were significantly associated with pathological T and N stages in the TCGA cohort. Moreover, the methylation site cg26006951, cg07380026 and TERT expression were significantly correlated with immune cell infiltration, common immunomodulators, and the level of the immune checkpoint receptor lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG-3) in TNBC patients.TERT promotertypermethylation plays an important role in TERT expression regulation and tumor microenvironment in TNBC. It is associated with overall survival and LAG-3 expression. TERT promoter hypermethylation may be a potential molecular biomarker for predicting response to the TERT inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors in TNBC.Copyright © 2023 Lin, Huang, Zhu, Jiang, Guo, Xia, Chen, Guo, Deng and Lin."
"37527019","USNAP: fast unique dense region detection and its application to lung cancer.","Bioinformatics","Many real-world problems can be modeled as annotated graphs. Scalable graph algorithms that extract actionable information from such data are in demand since these graphs are large, varying in topology, and have diverse node/edge annotations. When these graphs change over time they create dynamic graphs, and open the possibility to find patterns across different time points. In this article, we introduce a scalable algorithm that finds unique dense regions across time points in dynamic graphs. Such algorithms have applications in many different areas, including the biological, financial, and social domains.There are three important contributions to this manuscript. First, we designed a scalable algorithm, USNAP, to effectively identify dense subgraphs that are unique to a time stamp given a dynamic graph. Importantly, USNAP provides a lower bound of the density measure in each step of the greedy algorithm. Second, insights and understanding obtained from validating USNAP on real data show its effectiveness. While USNAP is domain independent, we applied it to four non-small cell lung cancer gene expression datasets. Stages in non-small cell lung cancer were modeled as dynamic graphs, and input to USNAP. Pathway enrichment analyses and comprehensive interpretations from literature show that USNAP identified biologically relevant mechanisms for different stages of cancer progression. Third, USNAP is scalable, and has a time complexity of O(m+mc log nc+nc log nc), where m is the number of edges, and n is the number of vertices in the dynamic graph; mc is the number of edges, and nc is the number of vertices in the collapsed graph.The code of USNAP is available at https://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~juris/data/USNAP22.© The Author(s) 2023.

"37607190","Inferring gene regulatory networks using transcriptional profiles as dynamical attractors.","PLoS Comput Biol","Genetic regulatory networks (GRNs) regulate the flow of genetic information from the genome to expressed messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and thus are critical to controlling the phenotypic characteristics of cells. Numerous methods exist for profiling mRNA transcript levels and identifying protein-DNA binding interactions at the genome-wide scale. These enable researchers to determine the structure and output of transcriptional regulatory networks, but uncovering the complete structure and regulatory logic of GRNs remains a challenge. The field of GRN inference aims to meet this challenge using computational modeling to derive the structure and logic of GRNs from experimental data and to encode this knowledge in Boolean networks, Bayesian networks, ordinary differential equation (ODE) models, or other modeling frameworks. However, most existing models do not incorporate dynamic transcriptional data since it has historically been less widely available in comparison to ""static"" transcriptional data. We report the development of an evolutionary algorithm-based ODE modeling approach (named EA) that integrates kinetic transcription data and the theory of attractor matching to infer GRN architecture and regulatory logic. Our method outperformed six leading GRN inference methods, none of which incorporate kinetic transcriptional data, in predicting regulatory connections among TFs when applied to a small-scale engineered synthetic GRN in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Moreover, we demonstrate the potential of our method to predict unknown transcriptional profiles that would be produced upon genetic perturbation of the GRN governing a two-state cellular phenotypic switch in Candida albicans. We established an iterative refinement strategy to facilitate candidate selection for experimentation; the experimental results in turn provide validation or improvement for the model. In this way, our GRN inference approach can expedite the development of a sophisticated mathematical model that can accurately describe the structure and dynamics of the in vivo GRN.Copyright: © 2023 Li et al.

"37614425",NA,NA,"Asthma is a complex disease, often with evident genetic predisposition; for example, the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs7130588 was significantly associated with asthma by genome-wide association study (GWAS). Analysis of 1000 Genomes Project data suggests that there is another SNP, rs6592645, in complete linkage disequilibrium with rs7130588 and should present the same signal in GWAS. However, the causal SNP and the mechanism for the association between rs7130588 and asthma remain to be elucidated. In the presents study, results from dual-luciferase assays indicated that the A/G alleles of rs7130588 failed to present significantly different reporter gene expression. By contrast, A allele of rs6592645 presented a significant increase in relative luciferase activity than G allele, thus suggesting that rs6592645 may be a causal SNP. Using chromosome conformation capture, the enhancer region containing rs6592645 was observed to interact with promoter region of leucine-rich repeat-containing 32 (LRRC32). Gene expression quantification suggested thatLRRC32expression is significantly increased in lung tissue of patients with asthma and is dependent on the genotype of this locus, thus verifying thatLRRC32may be involved in asthma onset and that rs6592645 can regulateLRRC32expression. Through chromatin immunoprecipitation, transcription factor 3 (TCF3) was identified to bind to rs6592645 surrounding region and the interaction between TCF3 and rs6592645 surrounding region was investigated. Results from the present study may improve our understanding of the mechanism by which the genetic variation in this locus might influence asthma susceptibility.Copyright © 2020, Spandidos Publications."

However, the etiological drivers remain elusive. Cis P-tau is an early etiological driver and blood biomarker in pre-clinical Alzheimer's and after vascular or traumatic brain injury, which can be targeted by stereo-specific antibody, with clinical trials ongoing. Here we find significant cis P-tau in the placenta and serum of PE patients, and in primary human trophoblasts exposed to hypoxia or sera from PE patients due to Pin1 inactivation. Depletion of cis P-tau from PE patient sera by the antibody prevents their ability to disrupt trophoblast invasion and endovascular activity and to cause the PE-like pathological and clinical features in pregnant humanized tau mice. Our studies uncover that cis P-tau is a central circulating etiological driver and its stereo-specific antibody is valuable for early PE diagnosis and treatment.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."
"37667186",NA,NA,"A relevant part of the genetic architecture of complex traits is still unknown; despite the discovery of many disease-associated common variants. Polygenic risk score (PRS) models are based on the evaluation of the additive effects attributable to common variants and have been successfully implemented to assess the genetic susceptibility for many phenotypes. In contrast, burden tests are often used to identify an enrichment of rare deleterious variants in specific genes. Both kinds of genetic contributions are typically analyzed independently. Many studies suggest that complex phenotypes are influenced by both low effect common variants and high effect rare deleterious variants. The aim of this paper is to integrate the effect of both common and rare functional variants for a more comprehensive genetic risk modeling.We developed a framework combining gene-based scores based on the enrichment of rare functionally relevant variants with genome-wide PRS based on common variants for association analysis and prediction models. We applied our framework on UK Biobank dataset with genotyping and exome data and considered 28 blood biomarkers levels as target phenotypes. For each biomarker, an association analysis was performed on full cohort using gene-based scores (GBS). The cohort was then split into 3 subsets for PRS construction and feature selection, predictive model training, and independent evaluation, respectively. Prediction models were generated including either PRS, GBS or both (combined).Association analyses of the cohort were able to detect significant genes that were previously known to be associated with different biomarkers. Interestingly, the analyses also revealed heterogeneous effect sizes and directionality highlighting the complexity of the blood biomarkers regulation. However, the combined models for many biomarkers show little or no improvement in prediction accuracy compared to the PRS models.This study shows that rare variants play an important role in the genetic architecture of complex multifactorial traits such as blood biomarkers. However, while rare deleterious variants play a strong role at an individual level, our results indicate that classical common variant based PRS might be more informative to predict the genetic susceptibility at the population level.© 2023.

This trend is reflected by the growing amount of clinical research on oligogenic diseases, where disease manifestations are influenced by combinations of variants on a few specific genes. Although statistical machine-learning methods have been developed to identify relevant genetic variant or gene combinations associated with oligogenic diseases, they rely on abstract features and black-box models, posing challenges to interpretability for medical experts and impeding their ability to comprehend and validate predictions. In this work, we present a novel, interpretable predictive approach based on a knowledge graph that not only provides accurate predictions of disease-causing gene interactions but also offers explanations for these results.We introduce BOCK, a knowledge graph constructed to explore disease-causing genetic interactions, integrating curated information on oligogenic diseases from clinical cases with relevant biomedical networks and ontologies. Using this graph, we developed a novel predictive framework based on heterogenous paths connecting gene pairs. This method trains an interpretable decision set model that not only accurately predicts pathogenic gene interactions, but also unveils the patterns associated with these diseases. A unique aspect of our approach is its ability to offer, along with each positive prediction, explanations in the form of subgraphs, revealing the specific entities and relationships that led to each pathogenic prediction.Our method, built with interpretability in mind, leverages heterogenous path information in knowledge graphs to predict pathogenic gene interactions and generate meaningful explanations.

Steady-state, standard expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) explain only a limited portion of GWAS signals2-6, while eQTLs involved in gene-by-environment (GxE) interactions have rarely been characterized in humans due to experimental challenges. Here, we characterized gene-by-diet effects in a baboon model system. By analyzing three tissue types obtained from 99 captive baboons, we identify hundreds of diet-responsive eQTLs with high tissue specificity. Diet-responsive eQTLs exhibit genomic localization and genic features that are distinct from steady-state eQTLs. Furthermore, the human orthologs of genes associated with diet-responsive eQTLs are enriched for GWAS genes associated with human metabolic traits, suggesting that context-responsive eQTLs with more complex regulatory effects are likely to explain GWAS hits that do not seem to overlap with standard eQTLs. Our results highlight the dynamic complexity of genetic regulatory effects and the potential of eQTLs with disease-relevant GxE interactions in enhancing the understanding of GWAS signals for human complex disease using the baboon model."
"37554308","Functional genomics in stem cell models: considerations and applications.","Front Cell Dev Biol","Protocols to differentiate human pluripotent stem cells have advanced in terms of cell type specificity and tissue-level complexity over the past 2 decades, which has facilitated human disease modeling in the most relevant cell types. The ability to generate induced PSCs (iPSCs) from patients further enables the study of disease mutations in an appropriate cellular context to reveal the mechanisms that underlie disease etiology and progression. As iPSC-derived disease models have improved in robustness and scale, they have also been adopted more widely for use in drug screens to discover new therapies and therapeutic targets. Advancement in genome editing technologies, in particular the discovery of CRISPR-Cas9, has further allowed for rapid development of iPSCs containing disease-causing mutations. CRISPR-Cas9 technologies have now evolved beyond creating single gene edits, aided by the fusion of inhibitory (CRISPRi) or activation (CRISPRa) domains to a catalytically dead Cas9 protein, enabling inhibition or activation of endogenous gene loci. These tools have been used in CRISPR knockout, CRISPRi, or CRISPRa screens to identify genetic modifiers that synergize or antagonize with disease mutations in a systematic and unbiased manner, resulting in identification of disease mechanisms and discovery of new therapeutic targets to accelerate drug discovery research. However, many technical challenges remain when applying large-scale functional genomics approaches to differentiated PSC populations. Here we review current technologies in the field of iPSC disease modeling and CRISPR-based functional genomics screens and practical considerations for implementation across a range of modalities, applications, and disease areas, as well as explore CRISPR screens that have been performed in iPSC models to-date and the insights and therapies these screens have produced.Copyright © 2023 Shevade, Peddada, Mader and Przybyla."

We previously developed CellNet, a computational tool to quantitatively assess the transcriptional fidelity of engineered cells compared with their natural counterparts, based on bulk-derived expression profiles. However, this platform and others were limited in their ability to compare data from different sources, and no current tool makes it easy to compare new protocols with existing state-of-the-art protocols in a standardized manner. Here, we utilized our prior application of the top-scoring pair transformation to build a computational platform, platform-agnostic CellNet (PACNet), to address both shortcomings. To demonstrate the utility of PACNet, we applied it to thousands of samples from over 100 studies that describe dozens of protocols designed to produce seven distinct cell types. We performed an in-depth examination of hepatocyte and cardiomyocyte protocols to identify the best-performing methods, characterize the extent of intra-protocol and inter-lab variation, and identify common off-target signatures, including a surprising neural/neuroendocrine signature in primary liver-derived organoids.

The two main types of lung cancer are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). More than 85% of lung cancers are NSCLC. Genetic factors play a significant role in the risk of NSCLC. Growing studies focus on studying risk factors at the molecular level. The aim of the study is to build a pipeline to integrate Genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) and transcriptomics data with machine learning to effectively identify genetic risk factors of NSCLC. GWAS datasets and GWAS summary data were downloaded from GWAS catalog, which include lung carcinoma genetic variants among the European population. Then, with the GWAS summary, data functional analysis of significant SNPs was performed using a webserver called FUMAGWAS. The transcriptomics data of NSCLC and non-NSCLC people were used to build a machine learning model to identify the key genes that help predict the NSCLC. The top up-regulation and down-regulation genes were identified by the BART cancer webserver, and the mechanistic roles of the genes were validated by literature review. By performing integrative analysis of GWAS and transcriptomics analysis using machine learning, we identified multiple SNPs and genes that related to NSCLC.

Applying scCARE-seq to examine chromatin architecture and transcription from 2i to serum single mouse embryonic stem cells, we observe improved separation of cell clusters compared with single-cell chromatin conformation capture. In addition, after defining the cell-cycle phase of each cell through chromatin architecture extracted by scCARE-seq, we find that periodic changes in chromatin architecture occur in parallel with transcription during the cell cycle.

Here, we report a Progressive Sperm Sorting Chip (PSSC) for high-quality sperm isolation. Based on the rheotaxis behavior of sperm, a gradient flow field is created in the chip for progressive sperm sorting. Clinical experiment results for 10 volunteers showed that greater than 90% of isolated sperm exhibit high motility (> 25 μm/s), high linearity (0.8), and a very low DNA fragmentation rate (< 5%). In addition, the whole process is label and chemical free. These features aid in gentle sperm sorting to obtain healthy sperm.

Autophagy-related differential expression genes (ARDEGs) were discovered through the integration of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with ARGs, while hub genes of KTCN were discovered by protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis. The probable biological roles of these hub ARDEGs were examined using functional enrichment analysis, and a KTCN diagnostic model was generated using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis. We also employed the CIBERSORTx and ssGSEA algorithms to identify potential regulatory pathways to compare the abundance of immune cell infiltrates and their association with hub genes. Finally, the hub gene expression levels were confirmed using validation datasets as well as blood samples from KTCN and healthy individuals.In this study, we identified 12 hub ARDEGs, of which 9 genes were substantially distinct between KTCN patients and normal groups. The LASSO risk score was used to generate the nomogram, and the calibration curve evaluated the model's effective diagnostic performance (C index of 0.961). Patients with KTCN had greater percentages of M2 Macrophages and Gamma delta T cells, according to CIBERSORTx and ssGSEA.

Differential expression analysis was performed to discern abnormally expressed genes between LUAD and control samples in TCGA cohort. The Cell type Identification by Estimating Relative Subsets of RNA Transcripts (CIBERSORT) algorithm was applied to determine varyingly infiltrated immune cells in LUAD compared with the control samples in TCGA cohort. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to identify genes associated with mRNA expression-based stemness index (mRNAsi) and M2 macrophages. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), RandomForest (RF) and support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) machine learning methods were conducted to detect gene signatures. Global survival evaluation (Kaplan-Meier curve) was applied to investigate the relationship between gene signatures and the survival time of LUAD patients. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were produced to define biomarkers relevant to diagnosis. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed to probe the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways related to diagnostic biomarkers. The public single-cell dataset of LUAD (GSE123902) was used to investigate the expression differences of diagnostic biomarkers in various cell types in LUAD. Real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to confirm key genes in lung adenocarcinoma cells.A total of 5,410 differentialy expressed genes (DEGs) as well as 15 differentially infiltrated immune cells were identified between LUAD and control sepcimens in TCGA cohort. Thirty-seven DEGs were associated with both M2 macrophages and mRNAsi according to the WGCNA analysis. Sixteen common gene signatures were obtained using three diverse algorithms. CBFA2T3, DENND3 and FCAMR were correlated to overall and disease-free survival of LUAD patients. ROC curves revealed that CBFA2T3 and DENND3 expression accurately classified LUAD and control samples. The results of single cell related analysis showed that two diagnostic biomarkers expressions were differed between the different tissue sources in M2-like macrophages. QRT-PCR demonstrated the mRNA expressions of CBFA2T3 and DENND3 were upregulated in lung adenocarcinoma cells A549 and H2122.Our study identified CBFA2T3 and DENND3 as key genes associated with mRNAsi and M2 macrophages in LUAD and investigated the potential molecular mechanisms underlying this relationship.© 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd."

The CIBERSORT method was used to analyze the abundances of 22 immune cell subtypes based on transcriptomic data. Metascape was used to investigate pathways related to the HLMRG signature.We developed a prognostic signature based on five HLMRGs (ERO1L, SIAH2, TGFA, TGFBI, and THBS1). This classifier successfully discriminated patients with disparate 28-day mortality in the discovery cohort (GSE65682, n = 479), and consistent results were observed in the validation cohort (E-MTAB-4421 plus E-MTAB-4451, n = 371). Estimation of immune infiltration revealed significant associations between the risk score and a subset of immune cells. Enrichment analysis revealed that pathways related to antimicrobial immune responses, leukocyte activation, and cell adhesion and migration were significantly associated with the HLMRG signature.Identification of a prognostic signature suggests the critical role of hypoxia and lactate metabolism in the pathophysiology of sepsis. The HLMRG signature can be used as an efficient tool for the risk stratification of patients with sepsis.© 2023. BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature."

In this regard, the discovery of novel early biomarkers holds substantial promise for ameliorating HCC-associated mortality. Efferocytosis, a vital immunological process, assumes a central position in the elimination of apoptotic cells. However, comprehensive investigations exploring the role of efferocytosis-related genes (EFRGs) in HCC are sparse, and their regulatory influence on HCC immunotherapy and targeted drug interventions remain poorly understood.RNA sequencing data and clinical characteristics of HCC patients were acquired from the TCGA database. To identify prognostically significant genes in HCC, we performed the limma package and conducted univariate Cox regression analysis. Subsequently, machine learning algorithms were employed to identify hub genes. To assess the immunological landscape of different HCC subtypes, we employed the CIBERSORT algorithm. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was utilized to investigate the expression levels of ERFGs in immune cells and to explore intercellular communication within HCC tissues. The migratory capacity of HCC cells was evaluated using CCK-8 assays, while drug sensitivity prediction reliability was determined through wound-healing assays.We have successfully identified a set of nine genes, termed EFRGs, that hold significant potential for the establishment of a hepatocellular carcinoma-specific prognostic model. Furthermore, leveraging the individual risk scores derived from this model, we were able to stratify patients into two distinct risk groups, unveiling notable disparities in terms of immune infiltration patterns and response to immunotherapy. Notably, the model's capacity to accurately predict drug responses was substantiated through comprehensive experimental investigations, encompassing wound-healing assay, and CCK8 experiments conducted on the HepG2 and Huh7 cell lines.We constructed an EFRGs model that serves as valuable tools for prognostic assessment and decision-making support in the context of immunotherapy and chemotherapy.Copyright © 2023 Liu, Li, Zhang, Hu and Li."
"37555866","Identification of hepatocellular carcinoma-related subtypes and development of a prognostic model: a study based on ferritinophagy-related genes.","Discov Oncol","Hepatocellular carcinoma still has a high incidence and mortality rate worldwide, and further research is needed to investigate its occurrence and development mechanisms in depth in order to identify new therapeutic targets. Ferritinophagy is a type of autophagy and a key factor in ferroptosis that could influence tumor onset and progression. Although, the potential role of ferritinophagy-related genes (FRGs) in liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) is unknown.Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of LIHC were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset. In addition, transcriptome and clinical follow-up outcome data of individuals with LIHC were extracted from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. FRGs were collected through the GeneCards database. Differential cell subpopulations were distinguished, and differentially expressed FRGs (DEFRGs) were obtained. Differential expression of FRGs and prognosis were observed according to the TCGA database. An FRG-related risk model was constructed to predict patient prognosis by absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and COX regression analyses, and its prognosis predictive power was validated. Ultimately, the association between risk score and tumor microenvironment (TME), immune cell infiltration, immune checkpoints, drug sensitivity, and tumor mutation burden (TMB) was analyzed. We also used quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to validate the expression of key genes in normal liver cells and liver cancer cells.We ultimately identified 8 cell types, and 7 differentially expressed FRGs genes (ZFP36, NCOA4, FTH1, FTL, TNF, PCBP1, CYB561A3) were found among immune cells, and we found that Monocytes and Macrophages were closely related to FRGs genes. Subsequently, COX regression analysis showed that patients with high expression of FTH1, FTL, and PCBP1 had significantly worse prognosis than those with low expression, and our survival prediction model, constructed based on age, stage, and risk score, showed better prognostic prediction ability. Our risk model based on 3 FRGs genes ultimately revealed significant differences between high-risk and low-risk groups in terms of immune infiltration and immune checkpoint correlation, drug sensitivity, and somatic mutation risk. Finally, we validated the key prognostic genes FTH1, FTL, using qRT-PCR, and found that the expression of FTH1 and FTL was significantly higher in various liver cancer cells than in normal liver cells. At the same time, immunohistochemistry showed that the expression of FTH1, FTL in tumor tissues was significantly higher than that in para-tumor tissues.This study identifies a considerable impact of FRGs on immunity and prognosis in individuals with LIHC. The collective findings of this research provide new ideas for personalized treatment of LIHC and a more targeted therapy approach for individuals with LIHC to improve their prognosis.© 2023.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying PARP inhibitors function beyond DNA damage repair pathways remain elusive, and identifying novel predictive targets that favorably respond to PARP inhibitors in PCa is an active area of research.The expression of GSDME in PCa cell lines and human PCa samples was determined by western blotting. Targeted bisulfite sequencing, gene enrichment analysis (GSEA), clone formation, construction of the stably transfected cell lines, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay, western blotting as well as a mouse model of subcutaneous xenografts were used to investigate the role of GSDME in PCa. The combinational therapeutic effect of olaparib and decitabine was determined using both in vitro and in vivo experiments.We have found low expression of GSDME in PCa. Interestingly, we demonstrated that GSDME activity is robustly induced in olaparib-treated cells undergoing pyroptosis, and that high methylation of the GSDME promoter dampens its activity in PCa cells. Intriguingly, genetically overexpressing GSDME does not inhibit tumor cell proliferation but instead confers sensitivity to olaparib. Furthermore, pharmacological treatment with the combination of olaparib and decitabine synergistically induces GSDME expression and cleavage through caspase-3 activation, thus promoting pyroptosis and enhancing anti-tumor response, ultimately resulting in tumor remission.Our findings highlight a novel therapeutic strategy for enhancing the long-term response to olaparib beyond HRR-deficient tumors in PCa, underscoring the critical role of GSDME in regulating tumorigenesis.© 2023.

Here we identify serum amyloid P component (SAP), a constitutive plasma protein normally excluded from the brain, as a potential drug target. After meta-analysis of three genome-wide association studies, comprising 44,288 participants,cis-Mendelian randomization showed that genes responsible for higher plasma SAP values are significantly associated with AD, Lewy body dementia and plasma tau concentration. These genetic findings are consistent with experimental evidence of SAP neurotoxicity and the strong, independent association of neocortex SAP content with dementia at death. Depletion of SAP from the blood and from the brain, as is provided by the safe, well tolerated, experimental drug, miridesap, may therefore contribute to treatment of neurodegeneration."

There is perhaps no greater example of disease pathogenesis resulting from the dysregulation of BDNF signaling than Huntington's disease (HD)-an inherited neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor, psychiatric, and cognitive impairments associated with basal ganglia dysfunction and the ultimate death of striatal projection neurons. Investigation of the collection of mechanisms leading to BDNF loss in HD highlights this neurotrophin's importance to neuronal viability and calls attention to opportunities for therapeutic interventions. Using electronic database searches of existing and forthcoming research, we constructed a literature review with the overarching goal of exploring the diverse set of molecular events that trigger BDNF dysregulation within HD. We highlighted research that investigated these major mechanisms in preclinical models of HD and connected these studies to those evaluating similar endpoints in human HD subjects. We also included a special focus on the growing body of literature detailing key transcriptomic and epigenetic alterations that affect BDNF abundance in HD. Finally, we offer critical evaluation of proposed neurotrophin-directed therapies and assessed clinical trials seeking to correct BDNF expression in HD individuals."

Questionnaires and interviews were used to collect information on general characteristics of the children, socio-economic characteristics of the family, maternal pregnancy history, and maternal disease exposure during pregnancy. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the association between maternal GDM exposure and the development of ASD in offspring. The potential interaction between offspring gender and maternal GDM exposure on the development of ASD in offspring was explored.The proportion of maternal GDM was significantly higher in the ASD group compared to the control group (16.3% vs 9.4%,P=0.014). After adjusting for variables such as gender, gestational age, mode of delivery, parity, and maternal education level, maternal GDM exposure was a risk factor for ASD in offspring (OR=2.18, 95%CI: 1.04-4.54,P=0.038). On the basis of adjusting the above variables, after further adjusting the variables including prenatal intake of multivitamins, folic acid intake in the first three months of pregnancy, and assisted reproduction the result trend did not change, but no statistical significance was observed (OR=1.94, 95%CI: 0.74-5.11,P=0.183).

Yet this approach is limited by its ability to infer underlying biological pathways and burden of testing tens of thousands of individual genes. Machine learning models that incorporate prior biological knowledge are necessary to extract meaningful pathways and generate rational hypothesis from the vast amount of gene expression data generated to date. We adopted an unsupervised machine learning method, Pathway-level information extractor (PLIER), to train the first mouse PLIER model on 190,111 mouse brain RNA-sequencing samples, the greatest amount of training data ever used by PLIER. mousiPLER converted gene expression data into a latent variables that align to known pathway or cell maker gene sets, substantially reducing data dimensionality and improving interpretability. To determine the utility of mousiPLIER, we applied it to a mouse brain aging study of microglia and astrocyte transcriptomic profiling. We found a specific set of latent variables that are significantly associated with aging, including one latent variable (LV41) corresponding to striatal signal. We next performed k-means clustering on the training data to identify studies that respond strongly to LV41, finding that the variable is relevant to striatum and aging across the scientific literature. Finally, we built a web server ( http://mousiplier.greenelab.com/ ) for users to easily explore the learned latent variables. Taken together this study provides proof of concept that mousiPLIER can uncover meaningful biological processes in mouse transcriptomic studies.Analysis of RNA-sequencing data commonly generates differential expression of individual genes across conditions. However, genes are regulated in complex networks, not as individual entities. Machine learning models that incorporate prior biological information are a powerful tool to analyze human gene expression. However, such models are lacking for mouse despite the vast number of mouse RNA-seq datasets. We trained a mouse pathway-level information extractor model (mousiPLIER). The model reduced the data dimensionality from over 10,000 genes to 196 latent variables that map to prior pathway and cell marker gene sets. We demonstrated the utility of mousiPLIER by applying it to mouse brain aging data and developed a web server to facilitate the use of the model by the scientific community."
"37606762","Radiomics-guided prognostic assessment of early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence post-radical resection.","J Cancer Res Clin Oncol","The prognosis of early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients after radical resection has received widespread attention, but reliable prediction methods are lacking. Radiomics derived from enhanced computed tomography (CT) imaging offers a potential avenue for practical prognostication in HCC patients.We recruited early-stage HCC patients undergoing radical resection. Statistical analyses were performed to identify clinicopathological and radiomic features linked to recurrence. Clinical, radiomic, and combined models (incorporating clinicopathological and radiomic features) were built using four algorithms. The performance of these models was scrutinized via fivefold cross-validation, with evaluation metrics including the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SEN), and specificity (SPE) being calculated and compared. Ultimately, an integrated nomogram was devised by combining independent clinicopathological predictors with the Radscore.From January 2016 through December 2020, HCC recurrence was observed in 167 cases (64.5%), with a median time to recurrence of 26.7 months following initial resection. Combined models outperformed those solely relying on clinicopathological or radiomic features. Notably, among the combined models, those employing support vector machine (SVM) algorithms exhibited the most promising predictive outcomes (AUC: 0.840 (95% Confidence interval (CI): [0.696, 0.984]), ACC: 0.805, SEN: 0.849, SPE: 0.733). Hepatitis B infection, tumour size > 5 cm, and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) > 400 ng/mL were identified as independent recurrence predictors and were subsequently amalgamated with the Radscore to create a visually intuitive nomogram, delivering robust and reliable predictive performance.Machine learning models amalgamating clinicopathological and radiomic features provide a valuable tool for clinicians to predict postoperative HCC recurrence, thereby informing early preventative strategies.© 2023.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, through an unbiased survey, we show that the binding motif of Bmal1, a central transcription factor of the circadian clock, is enriched in differentially hydroxymethylated regions (DhMRs) of mouse DRG after peripheral lesion. By applying conditional deletion of Bmal1 in neurons, in vitro and in vivo neurite outgrowth assays, as well as transcriptomic profiling, we demonstrate that Bmal1 inhibits axon regeneration, in part through a functional link with the epigenetic factor Tet3. Mechanistically, we reveal that Bmal1 acts as a gatekeeper of neuroepigenetic responses to axonal injury by limiting Tet3 expression and restricting 5hmC modifications. Bmal1-regulated genes not only concern axon growth, but also stress responses and energy homeostasis. Furthermore, we uncover an epigenetic rhythm of diurnal oscillation of Tet3 and 5hmC levels in DRG neurons, corresponding to time-of-day effect on axon growth potential. Collectively, our studies demonstrate that targeting Bmal1 enhances axon regeneration.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."

We used repeat-element-aware liquid-biopsy technology and single-molecule nanopore sequencing to profile the cell-free transcriptome in plasma from patients with cancer and to examine millions of genomic features comprising all annotated genes and repeat elements throughout the genome. By aggregating individual repeat elements to the subfamily level, we found that samples with pancreatic cancer are enriched with specific Alu subfamilies, whereas other cancers have their own characteristic cell-free RNA profile.

Herein, we identify SMYD3 as a mediator of immune escape in human papilloma virus (HPV)-negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), an aggressive disease with poor response to immunotherapy with pembrolizumab. SMYD3 depletion induces upregulation of multiple type I interferon (IFN) response and antigen presentation machinery genes in HNSCC cells. Mechanistically, SMYD3 binds to and regulates the transcription of UHRF1, encoding for a reader of H3K9me3, which binds to H3K9me3-enriched promoters of key immune-related genes, recruits DNMT1, and silences their expression. SMYD3 further maintains the repression of immune-related genes through intragenic deposition of H4K20me3. In vivo, Smyd3 depletion induces influx of CD8+T cells and increases sensitivity to anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1) therapy. SMYD3 overexpression is associated with decreased CD8 T cell infiltration and poor response to neoadjuvant pembrolizumab. These data support combining SMYD3 depletion strategies with checkpoint blockade to overcome anti-PD-1 resistance in HPV-negative HNSCC.Published by Elsevier Inc."

The past two decades have witnessed tremendous attention in long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which are a new hope for the development of targeted drug therapy for metastatic cancers; however, the underlying mechanism of lncRNAs involved in BLCa hematogenous metastasis remains to be elucidated. Here, we identified BLCa-associated transcript 3 (BLACAT3), a lncRNA, which was aberrantly upregulated in BLCa and corelated with poor prognosis of patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Methodologically, m6A epitranscriptomic microarray, RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry (MS) were used to screen the key molecules of the regulatory axis. Functional assays, animal models and clinical samples were used to explore the roles of BLACAT3 in BLCa in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, m6A modification contributes to BLACAT3 upregulation by stabilizing RNA structure. BLACAT3 recruits YBX3 to shuttle into the nucleus, synergistically enhances NCF2 transcription, and promotes BLCa angiogenesis and hematogenous metastasis by activating downstream NF-κB signaling. Our findings will develop prognosis prediction tools for BLCa patients and discover novel therapeutic biological targets for metastatic BLCa.© 2023. The Author(s)."

In this review, we focus on the molecular underpinning of senescence and neurodegeneration related to age-associated brain diseases, in particular, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, along with introducing nutrients or phytochemicals that modulate age-associated molecular dysfunctions, potentially offering preventive or therapeutic benefits. Based on current knowledge, the dysregulation of microglia genes and neuroinflammation, telomere attrition, neuronal stem cell degradation, vascular system dysfunction, reactive oxygen species, loss of chromosome X inactivation in females, and gut microbiome dysbiosis have been seen to play pivotal roles in neurodegeneration in an interactive manner. There are several phytochemicals (e.g., curcumin, EGCG, fucoidan, galangin, astin C, apigenin, resveratrol, phytic acid, acacetin, daucosterol, silibinin, sulforaphane, withaferin A, and betulinic acid) that modulate the dysfunction of one or several key genes (e.g., TREM2, C3, C3aR1, TNFA, NF-kb, TGFB1&2, SIRT1&6, HMGB1, and STING) affected in the aged brain. Although phytochemicals have shown promise in slowing down the progression of age-related brain diseases, more studies to identify their efficacy, alone or in combinations, in preclinical systems can help to design novel nutritional strategies for the management of neurodegenerative diseases in humans."
"37622096","Calibrating epigenetic clocks with training data error.","Evol Appl","Animal age data are valuable for management of wildlife populations. Yet, for most species, there is no practical method for determining the age of unknown individuals. However, epigenetic clocks, a molecular-based method, are capable of age prediction by sampling specific tissue types and measuring DNA methylation levels at specific loci. Developing an epigenetic clock requires a large number of samples from animals of known ages. For most species, there are no individuals whose exact ages are known, making epigenetic clock calibration inaccurate or impossible. For many epigenetic clocks, calibration samples with inaccurate age estimates introduce a degree of error to epigenetic clock calibration. In this study, we investigated how much error in the training data set of an epigenetic clock can be tolerated before it resulted in an unacceptable increase in error for age prediction. Using four publicly available data sets, we artificially increased the training data age error by iterations of 1% and then tested the model against an independent set of known ages. A small effect size increase (Cohen's d >0.2) was detected when the error in age was higher than 22%. The effect size increased linearly with age error. This threshold was independent of sample size. Downstream applications for age data may have a more important role in deciding how much error can be tolerated for age prediction. If highly precise age estimates are required, then it may be futile to embark on the development of an epigenetic clock when there is no accurately aged calibration population to work with. However, for other problems, such as determining the relative age order of pairs of individuals, a lower-quality calibration data set may be adequate.© 2023 The Authors.

Our ability to develop novel disease models of genetic risk factors, disease modifiers, and other FTD/ALS-relevant targets is impeded by the significant amount of time and capital required to develop conventional knockout and transgenic mice. To overcome these limitations, we have generated a novel CRISPRi interference (CRISPRi) knockin mouse. CRISPRi uses a catalytically dead form of Cas9, fused to a transcriptional repressor to knockdown protein expression, following the introduction of single guide RNA against the gene of interest. To validate the utility of this model we have selected the TAR DNA binding protein (TDP-43) splicing target, stathmin-2 (STMN2).STMN2RNA is downregulated in FTD/ALS due to loss of TDP-43 activity and STMN2 loss is suggested to play a role in ALS pathogenesis. The involvement of STMN2 loss of function in FTD has yet to be determined. We find that STMN2 protein levels in familial FTD cases are significantly reduced compared to controls, supporting that STMN2 depletion may be involved in the pathogenesis of FTD. Here, we provide proof-of-concept that we can simultaneously knock down Stmn2 and express the expanded repeat in the Chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9ORF72) gene, successfully replicating features of C9-associated pathology. Of interest, depletion of Stmn2 had no effect on expression or deposition of dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs), but significantly decreased the number of phosphorylated Tdp-43 (pTdp-43) inclusions.

These cells are transduced with a lentivirus vector encoding a guide RNA (gRNA) that targets multiple repeats of the Y chromosome centromere, effectively removing the Y chromosome. These cells are then transplanted into lethally irradiated wildtype C57BL6 mice. Control gRNAs are designed to target either no specific region or the fourth intron ofActingene. Transduced cells are tracked by measuring the fraction of blood cells expressing the virally encoded reporter gene tRFP.

In sensitivity analyses restricted to the nonrecanalization group (n=987 in the combined cohort), the association was significant also after separate adjustment for age (odds ratio, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.1-2.4]) and when additionally adjusting for stroke severity and diabetes (odds ratio, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.1-2.5]).We observed an association between LOY and poor outcome after ischemic stroke in patients not receiving recanalization therapy. Future studies on LOY and other somatic genetic alterations in larger stroke cohorts are warranted."
"37576439","Investigating the Relationship Between Body Shape and Life History Traits in Toothed Whales: Can Body Shape Predict Fast-Slow Life Histories?","Evol Biol","A widespread pattern in vertebrate life-history evolution is for species to evolve towards either fast or slow life histories; however, the underlying causes of this pattern remain unclear. Toothed whales (Odontoceti) are a diverse group with a range of body sizes and life histories, making them an ideal model to investigate potential drivers of this dichotomy. Using ancestral reconstruction, we identified that certain groups of odontocetes evolved more-streamlined, presumably faster, body shapes around the same time that killer whales (Orcinus orca) evolved into whale predators approximately 1 Mya during the Pleistocene. This suggests that the evolution of a streamlined body shape may have been an adaptation to escape killer whale predation, leading to longer life-history events. To test this hypothesis, we performed a cluster analysis of odontocete whales and confirmed the dual pattern of life-history traits, with one group referred to as 'reproducers' characterized by early age of maturity, short gestation, short interbirth interval, and short lifespan, and the other group referred to as 'bet-hedgers' exhibiting the opposite pattern. However, we found that life history grouping was relatively unrelated to whale shape (i.e., more streamlined or less streamlined). Therefore, we incorporated principal component results into mixed effects models, and the model results indicated that body shape was positively related to neonate length (a measure of investment in progeny), but not significantly related to the temporal life-history traits. Thus, whale body shape is not a sufficient explanation for the evolution of fast-slow life histories in odontocete whales.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11692-023-09605-4.© Crown 2023."

Organoids can mimic the occurrence and progression of original tissues and widely used in disease models in recent years. The ability of tumor organoids to retain characteristic of original tumors make them unique for tumorigenesis and cancer therapy. However, the history of organoid development and the application of organoid technology in cancer therapy are not well understood. In this paper, we reviewed the history of organoids development, the culture methods of tumor organoids establishing and the applications of organoids in cancer research for better understanding the process of tumor development and providing better strategies for cancer therapy. The standardization of organoids cultivation facilitated the large-scale production of tumor organoids. Moreover, it was found that combination of tumor organoids and other cells such as immune cells, fibroblasts and nervous cells would better mimic the microenvironment of tumor progression. This might be important developing directions for tumor organoids in the future.Copyright © 2023 Jiang, Oyang, Peng, Liu, Xu, Wu, Tan, Yang, Han, Lin, Xia, Peng, Tang, Luo, Su, Shi, Zhou and Liao."

To date, most anti-MUC16 antibodies are directed towards the extracellular domain of MUC16 (CA125), which is usually cleaved and shed in the circulation hence obscuring antibody accessibility to the cancer cells. Herein, we establish the utility of targeting a post-cleavage generated, surface-tethered oncogenic MUC16 carboxy-terminal (MUC16-Cter) domain by using a novel chimeric antibody in human IgG1 format, ch5E6, whose epitope expression directly correlates with disease severity in both cancers. ch5E6 binds and interferes with MUC16-associated oncogenesis, suppresses the downstream signaling pFAK(Y397)/p-p70S6K(T389)/N-cadherin axis and exert antiproliferative effects in cancer cells, 3D organoids, and tumor xenografts of both PC and NSCLC. The robust clinical correlations observed between MUC16 and N-cadherin in patient tumors and metastatic samples imply ch5E6 potential in targeting a complex and significantly occurring phenomenon of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) associated with disease aggressiveness. Our study supports evaluating ch5E6 with standard-of-care drugs, to potentially augment treatment outcomes in malignancies inflicted with MUC16-associated poor prognosis.© 2023.

We also analyzed a secondary event population from a randomized, double-blind lipid-lowering clinical trial (2013-2016), consisting of individuals with stable ASCVD receiving statin therapy and for whom proteomic data were available for 6791 individuals.Protein risk scores (based on 4963 plasma protein levels and developed in a training set in the primary event population); polygenic risk scores for coronary artery disease and stroke; and clinical risk factors that included age, sex, statin use, hypertension treatment, type 2 diabetes, body mass index, and smoking status at the time of plasma sampling.Outcomes were composites of myocardial infarction, stroke, and coronary heart disease death or cardiovascular death. Performance was evaluated using Cox survival models and measures of discrimination and reclassification that accounted for the competing risk of non-ASCVD death.In the primary event population test set (4018 individuals [59.0% women]; 465 events; median follow-up, 15.8 years), the protein risk score had a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.93 per SD (95% CI, 1.75 to 2.13). Addition of protein risk score and polygenic risk scores significantly increased the C index when added to a clinical risk factor model (C index change, 0.022 [95% CI, 0.007 to 0.038]). Addition of the protein risk score alone to a clinical risk factor model also led to a significantly increased C index (difference, 0.014 [95% CI, 0.002 to 0.028]). Among White individuals in the secondary event population (6307 participants; 432 events; median follow-up, 2.2 years), the protein risk score had an HR of 1.62 per SD (95% CI, 1.48 to 1.79) and significantly increased C index when added to a clinical risk factor model (C index change, 0.026 [95% CI, 0.011 to 0.042]). The protein risk score was significantly associated with major adverse cardiovascular events among individuals of African and Asian ancestries in the secondary event population.A protein risk score was significantly associated with ASCVD events in primary and secondary event populations. When added to clinical risk factors, the protein risk score and polygenic risk score both provided statistically significant but modest improvement in discrimination."

An observed reduction in CMTM5 expression in post-mortem MS lesions prompted further investigations in both in vitro and in vivo animal models. In the cuprizone animal model, we detected a decrease in CMTM5 expression in oligodendrocytes that is absent in other members of the CMTM protein family. Our findings also confirm these results in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model with decreased CMTM5 expression in both cerebellum and spinal cord white matter. We also examined the effects of aCmtm5knockdown in vitro in the oligodendroglial Oli-neu mouse cell line using the CRISPR interference technique. Interestingly, we found no effects on cell response to thapsigargin-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress as determined byAtf4activity, an indicator of cellular stress responses. Overall, these results substantiate previous findings suggesting that CMTM5, rather than contributing to myelin biogenesis, is involved in maintaining axonal integrity. Our study further demonstrates that the knockdown ofCmtm5in vitro does not modulate oligodendroglial responses to ER stress. These results warrant further investigation into the functional role of CMTM5 during axonal degeneration in the context of demyelinating conditions."
"37621717","Retinal astrocyte morphology predicts integration of vascular and neuronal architecture.","Front Neurosci","Astrocytes are important regulators of blood flow and play a key role in the response to injury and disease in the central nervous system (CNS). Despite having an understanding that structural changes to these cells have consequences for local neurovascular physiology, individual astrocyte morphology remains largely unexplored in the retina. Here, we used MORF3 mice to capture full membranous morphology for over fifteen hundred individual astrocytes in the mouse retina, a highly metabolically active component of the CNS. We demonstrate that retinal astrocytes have been misrepresented as stellate in morphology due to marker use like GFAP and S100β which underestimates cell complexity. We also find that astrocytes contain recurring morphological motifs which are predictive of the underlying neurovascular architecture of the inner retina and suggestive of function. These motifs predict fine sampling and integration of retinal ganglion cell electrical activity with consequences for blood flow regulation. Additionally, our data shows that astrocytes participate in neurovascular interactions to a much greater degree than currently reported. 100% of cells contact the vasculature through one of three mutually exclusive classes of connections. Similarly, 100% of cells contact some neuronal element, be it an RGC axon or soma. Finally, we report that astrocyte morphology depends on retinal eccentricity, with cells appearing compressed near the nerve head and in the periphery. These results reveal a large degree of astrocyte morphological complexity that informs their contribution to neurovascular coupling in the retina.Copyright © 2023 Holden, Wareham and Calkins."
"37558878",NA,NA,"Dendritic cells (DCs) have a role in the development and activation of self-reactive pathogenic T cells1,2. Genetic variants that are associated with the function of DCs have been linked to autoimmune disorders3,4, and DCs are therefore attractive therapeutic targets for such diseases. However, developing DC-targeted therapies for autoimmunity requires identification of the mechanisms that regulate DC function. Here, using single-cell and bulk transcriptional and metabolic analyses in combination with cell-specific gene perturbation studies, we identify a regulatory loop of negative feedback that operates in DCs to limit immunopathology. Specifically, we find that lactate, produced by activated DCs and other immune cells, boosts the expression of NDUFA4L2 through a mechanism mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α). NDUFA4L2 limits the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species that activate XBP1-driven transcriptional modules in DCs that are involved in the control of pathogenic autoimmune T cells. We also engineer a probiotic that produces lactate and suppresses T cell autoimmunity through the activation of HIF-1α-NDUFA4L2 signalling in DCs. In summary, we identify an immunometabolic pathway that regulates DC function, and develop a synthetic probiotic for its therapeutic activation.© 2023.

Using a tailored, sensitive, label-free mass spectrometry-based secretome approach, not previously applied to nonimmune cells, we identified 119 MMP-9 and 21 MMP-2 potential substrates at the cell surface of primary astrocytes, including known substrates (β-dystroglycan) and a broad spectrum of previously unknown MMP-dependent events involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. Using neuroinflammation as a model of assessing compromised astroglial barrier function, a selection of the potential MMP substrates were confirmed in vivo and verified in human samples, including vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and neuronal cell adhesion molecule. We provide a unique resource of potential MMP-2/MMP-9 substrates specific for the astroglia barrier. Our data support a role for the gelatinases in the formation and maintenance of this barrier but also in astrocyte-neuron interactions."
"37630850",NA,NA,"Aging is characterized by alterations in the inflammatory microenvironment, which is tightly regulated by a complex network of inflammatory mediators. Excessive calorie consumption contributes to age- and lifestyle-associated diseases like obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and cancer, while limited nutrient availability may lead to systemic health-promoting adaptations. Geroprotective effects of short-term caloric restriction (CR) can beneficially regulate innate immune receptors and interferon signaling in the liver of aged mice, but how CR impacts the hepatic release of immunomodulatory mediators like cytokines and lipid mediators (LM) is elusive. Here, we investigated the impact of aging on the inflammatory microenvironment in the liver and its linkage to calorie consumption. The livers of female young and aged C57BL/6JRj mice, as well as of aged mice after caloric restriction (CR) up to 28 days, with and without subsequent re-feeding (2 days), were evaluated. Surprisingly, despite differences in the hepatic proteome of young and old mice, aging did not promote a pro-inflammatory environment in the liver, but it reduced lipoxygenase-mediated formation of LM from polyunsaturated fatty acids without affecting the expression of the involved lipoxygenases and related oxygenases. Moreover, CR failed to ameliorate the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines but shifted the LM production to the formation of monohydroxylated LM with inflammation-resolving features. Unexpectedly, re-feeding after CR even further decreased the inflammatory response as LM species were markedly downregulated. Our findings raise the question of how short-term CR is indeed beneficial as a nutritional intervention for healthy elderly subjects and further stress the necessity to address tissue-specific inflammatory states."

However, there is lacking comprehensive analyses of immunosenescence-related pathways. Meanwhile, the sex disparities of immunosenescence in cancer are still poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed the multi-omics data of 12,836 tumor samples, including genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. We systematically identified immunosenescence pathways that were disordered across cancer types. The mutations and copy number variations of immunosenescence pathways were found to be more active in pan-cancer. We reconstructed the immunosenescence core pathways (ISC-pathways) to improve the ability of prognostic stratification in 33 cancer types. We also found the head and neck squamous carcinoma (HNSC) contained abundant sex-specific immunosenescence features and showed sex differences in survival. We found that OSI-027 was a potential sex-specific drug in HNSC tumors, which tended to be more effective in male HNSC by targeting the MTOR gene in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. In conclusion, our study provided a systematic understanding of immunosenescence pathways and revealed the global characteristics of immunosenescence in pan-cancer. We highlighted MTOR gene could be a powerful immunosenescence biomarker of HNSC that helps to develop sex-specific immunosenescence drugs.© 2023.

"37604983","The sex gap in bladder cancer survival - a missing link in bladder cancer care?","Nat Rev Urol","The differences in bladder cancer outcomes between the sexes has again been highlighted. Uncommon among cancers, bladder cancer outcomes are notably worse for women than for men. Furthermore, bladder cancer is three to four times more common among men than among women. Factors that might explain these sex differences include understanding the importance of haematuria as a symptom of bladder cancer by both clinicians and patients, the resultant delays in diagnosis and referral of women with haematuria, and health-care access. Notably, these factors seem to have geographical variation and are not consistent across all health-care systems. Likewise, data relating to sex-specific treatment responses for patients with non-muscle-invasive or muscle-invasive bladder cancer are inconsistent. The influence of differences in the microbiome, bladder wall thickness and urine dwell times remain to be elucidated. The interplay of hormone signalling, gene expression, immunology and the tumour microenvironment remains complex but probably underpins the sexual dimorphism in disease incidence and stage and histology at presentation. The contribution of these biological phenomena to sex-specific outcome differences is probable, albeit potentially treatment-specific, and further understanding is required. Notwithstanding these aspects, we identify opportunities to harness biological differences to improve treatment outcomes, as well as areas of fundamental and translational research to pursue. At the level of policy and health-care delivery, improvements can be made across the domains of patient awareness, clinician education, referral pathways and guideline-based care. Together, we aim to highlight opportunities to close the sex gap in bladder cancer outcomes.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."
"37666996","Inflammation across tissues: can shared cell biology help design smarter trials?","Nat Rev Rheumatol","Immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) are responsible for substantial global disease burden and associated health-care costs. Traditional models of research and service delivery silo their management within organ-based medical disciplines. Very often patients with disease in one organ have comorbid involvement in another, suggesting shared pathogenic pathways. Moreover, different IMIDs are often treated with the same drugs (including glucocorticoids, immunoregulators and biologics). Unlocking the cellular basis of these diseases remains a major challenge, leading us to ask why, if these diseases have so much in common, they are not investigated in a common manner. A tissue-based, cellular understanding of inflammation might pave the way for cross-disease, cross-discipline basket trials (testing one drug across two or more diseases) to reduce the risk of failure of early-phase drug development in IMIDs. This new approach will enable rapid assessment of the efficacy of new therapeutic agents in cross-disease translational research in humans.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."

To better understand the role of tumor-infiltrating B cells (TIBs) in GC, this work used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) and bulk RNA sequencing (bulk RNA-Seq) data to identify candidate hub genes. Both scRNA-Seq and bulk RNA-Seq data for stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) were obtained from the GEO and TCGA databases, respectively. Using scRNA-seq data, the FindNeighbors and FindClusters tools were used to group the cells into distinct groups. Immune cell clusters were sought in the massive RNA-seq expression matrix using the single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA). The expression profiles were used in Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to build TCGA's gene coexpression networks. Next, univariate Cox regression, LASSO regression, and Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to identify hub genes in scRNA-seq data from sequential B-cell analyses. Finally, we examined the correlation between the hub genes and TIBs utilizing the TISIDB database. We confirmed the immune-related markers in clinical validation samples using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). 15 cell clusters were classified in the scRNA-seq database. According to the WGCNA findings, the green module is most associated with cancer and B cells. The intersection of 12 genes in two separate datasets (scRNA and bulk) was attained for further analysis. However, survival studies revealed that increasedC-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4(CXCR4) expression was linked to worse overall survival.CXCR4expression is correlated with active, immature, and memory B cells in STAD were identified. Finally, RT-PCR and IHC assays verified that in GC,CXCR4is overexpressed, and its expression level correlates with TIBs. We used scRNA-Seq and bulk RNA-Seq to study STAD's cellular composition. We found thatCXCR4is highly expressed by TIBs in GC, suggesting that it may serve as a hub gene for these cells and a starting point for future research into the molecular mechanisms by which these immune cells gain access to tumors and potentially identify therapeutic targets."

This review offers an in-depth assessment of the molecular profiling undertaken to understand this heterogeneity, focusing on multi-omics strategies applied both in traditional bulk and single-cell levels. Genomic investigations have profoundly informed our comprehension of breast cancer, enabling its categorization into six intrinsic molecular subtypes. Beyond genomics, transcriptomics has rendered deeper insights into the gene expression landscape of breast cancer cells. It has also facilitated the formulation of more precise predictive and prognostic models, thereby enriching the field of personalized medicine in breast cancer. The comparison between traditional and single-cell transcriptomics has identified unique gene expression patterns and facilitated the understanding of cell-to-cell variability. Proteomics provides further insights into breast cancer subtypes by illuminating intricate protein expression patterns and their post-translational modifications. The adoption of single-cell proteomics has been instrumental in this regard, revealing the complex dynamics of protein regulation and interaction. Despite these advancements, this review underscores the need for a holistic integration of multiple 'omics' strategies to fully decipher breast cancer heterogeneity. Such integration not only ensures a comprehensive understanding of breast cancer's molecular complexities, but also promotes the development of personalized treatment strategies."

Nearly all known sets of immune cell signatures have been derived by making use of only single gene expression datasets. Utilizing the power of multiple integrated datasets could lead to high-quality immune cell signatures which could be used as superior inputs to machine learning-based cell type classification approaches.We established a novel workflow for the discovery of immune cell type signatures based primarily on gene-versus-gene expression similarity. It leverages multiple datasets, here seven single cell expression datasets from six different cancer types and resulted in eleven immune cell type-specific gene expression signatures. We used these to train random forest classifiers for immune cell type assignment for single-cell RNA-seq datasets. We obtained similar or better prediction results compared to commonly used methods for cell type assignment in independent benchmarking datasets. Our gene signature set yields higher prediction scores than other published immune cell type gene sets in random forest-based cell type classification. We further demonstrate how our approach helps to avoid bias in downstream statistical analyses by re-analysis of a published IFN stimulation experiment.We demonstrated the quality of our immune cell signatures and their strong performance in a random forest-based cell typing approach. We argue that classifying cells based on our comparably slim sets of genes accompanied by a random forest-based approach not only matches or outperforms widely used published approaches. It also facilitates unbiased downstream statistical analyses of differential gene expression between cell types for significantly more genes compared to previous cell classification algorithms.Copyright © 2023 Aybey, Zhao, Brors and Staub."

We previously developed an unsupervised receptor abundance estimation technique named SPECK (Surface Protein abundance Estimation using CKmeans-based clustered thresholding) to address the challenges associated with accurate abundance estimation. In that paper, we concluded that SPECK results in improved concordance with Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing (CITE-seq) data relative to comparative unsupervised abundance estimation techniques using only single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. In this paper, we outline a new supervised receptor abundance estimation method called STREAK (gene Set Testing-based Receptor abundance Estimation using Adjusted distances and cKmeans thresholding) that leverages associations learned from joint scRNA-seq/CITE-seq training data and a thresholded gene set scoring mechanism to estimate receptor abundance for scRNA-seq target data. We evaluate STREAK relative to both unsupervised and supervised receptor abundance estimation techniques using two evaluation approaches on six joint scRNA-seq/CITE-seq datasets that represent four human and mouse tissue types. We conclude that STREAK outperforms other abundance estimation strategies and provides a more biologically interpretable and transparent statistical model.Copyright: © 2023 Javaid, Frost.

Currently, the common practice in scRNA-seq is to determine cell type labels through unsupervised clustering and the examination of cluster-specific genes. However, even small differences in analysis and parameter choosing can greatly alter clustering results and thus impose great influence on which cell types are identified. Existing methods largely focus on determining the optimal number of robust clusters, which can be problematic for identifying cells of extremely low abundance due to their subtle contributions toward overall patterns of gene expression.Here, we present a carefully designed framework, SCISSORS, which accurately profiles subclusters within broad cluster(s) for the identification of rare cell types in scRNA-seq data. SCISSORS employs silhouette scoring for the estimation of heterogeneity of clusters and reveals rare cells in heterogenous clusters by a multi-step semi-supervised reclustering process. Additionally, SCISSORS provides a method for the identification of marker genes of high specificity to the cell type.

An important component of the pathogenesis of the metabolic syndrome is mitochondrial dysfunction, which is associated with tissue hypoxia, disruption of mitochondrial integrity, increased production of reactive oxygen species, and a decrease in ATP, leading to a chronic inflammatory state that affects tissues and organ systems. The mitochondrial AAA + protease Lon (Lonp1) has a broad spectrum of activities. In addition to its classical function (degradation of misfolded or damaged proteins), enzymatic activity (proteolysis, chaperone activity, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)binding) has been demonstrated. At the same time, the spectrum of Lonp1 activity extends to the regulation of cellular processes inside mitochondria, as well as outside mitochondria (nuclear localization). This mitochondrial protease with enzymatic activity may be a promising molecular target for the development of targeted therapy for MetS and its components. The aim of this review is to elucidate the role of mtDNA in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome and its components as a key component of mitochondrial dysfunction and to describe the promising and little-studied AAA + LonP1 protease as a potential target in metabolic disorders."

In the current absence of studies to probe the impact of candidate causal variants in the cornea, we aimed to fill some of this knowledge gap by leveraging tissue-shared genetic effects.Methods:181 CRF signals were examined for evidence of colocalization with genetic signals affecting steady-state gene transcription and splicing in adult, non-eye, tissues of the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. Expression of candidate causal genes thus nominated was evaluated in single cell transcriptomes from adult cornea, limbus and conjunctiva. Fine-mapping and colocalization of CRF and keratoconus GWAS signals was also deployed to support their sharing causal variants.Results and discussion:26.5% of CRF causal signals colocalized with GTEx v8 signals and nominated genes enriched in genes with high and specific expression in corneal stromal cells amongst tissues examined. Enrichment analyses carried out with nearest genes to all 181 CRF GWAS signals indicated that stromal cells of the limbus could be susceptible to signals that did not colocalize with GTEx's. These cells might not be well represented in GTEx and/or the genetic associations might have context specific effects. The causal signals shared with GTEx provide new insights into mediation of CRF genetic effects, including modulation of splicing events. Functionally relevant roles for several implicated genes' products in providing tensile strength, mechano-sensing and signaling make the corresponding genes and regulatory variants prime candidates to be validated and their roles and effects across tissues elucidated. Colocalization of CRF and keratoconus GWAS signals strengthened support for shared causal variants but also highlighted many ways into which likely true shared signals could be missed when using readily available GWAS summary statistics.Copyright © 2023 Jiang, Boutin and Vitart."

Implementation of specific computational approaches such as artificial intelligence, machine learning and molecular subtyping has yet to become widespread in urology clinical practice for reasons of cost, disruption of clinical workflow and need for prospective validation of informatics approaches in independent patient cohorts. Solving these challenges might accelerate routine integration of bioinformatics into clinical settings.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."
"37667220","TET2 inhibits the proliferation and metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma cells via activation of the cGAS-STING signalling pathway.","BMC Cancer","Effective identification and development of new molecular methods for the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains an urgent clinical need. DNA methylation patterns at cytosine bases in the genome are closely related to gene expression, and abnormal DNA methylation is frequently observed in various cancers. The ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes oxidize 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and promote locus-specific DNA methylation reversal. This study aimed to explore the role of the TET2 protein and its downstream effector, 5-hmC/5-mC DNA modification, in LUAD progression.The expression of TET2 was analysed by real-time PCR, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. The 5-hmC DNA content was determined by a colorimetric kit. Activation of the cGAS-STING signalling pathway was evaluated by Western blotting. CCK-8, wound healing and Transwell assays were performed to evaluate the effect of TET2 on cell proliferation, migration and invasion abilities. A xenograft model was used to analyse the effect of TET2 on the tumorigenic ability of A549 cells.TET2 overexpression decreased proliferation and metastasis of A549 and H1975 cells in vitro and in vivo. However, TET2 knockdown dramatically enhanced the proliferation, migration and invasion of A549 and H1975 cells. Mechanistically, activation of the cGAS-STING signalling pathway is critical for the TET2-mediated suppression of LUAD cell tumorigenesis and metastasis.In this study, we demonstrate a tumour suppressor role of TET2 in LUAD, providing new potential molecular therapeutic targets and clinical therapies for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.© 2023.

"37580596",NA,NA,"Cellular differentiation requires extensive alterations in chromatin structure and function, which is elicited by the coordinated action of chromatin and transcription factors. By contrast with transcription factors, the roles of chromatin factors in differentiation have not been systematically characterized. Here, we combine bulk ex vivo and single-cell in vivo CRISPR screens to characterize the role of chromatin factor families in hematopoiesis. We uncover marked lineage specificities for 142 chromatin factors, revealing functional diversity among related chromatin factors (i.e. barrier-to-autointegration factor subcomplexes) as well as shared roles for unrelated repressive complexes that restrain excessive myeloid differentiation. Using epigenetic profiling, we identify functional interactions between lineage-determining transcription factors and several chromatin factors that explain their lineage dependencies. Studying chromatin factor functions in leukemia, we show that leukemia cells engage homeostatic chromatin factor functions to block differentiation, generating specific chromatin factor-transcription factor interactions that might be therapeutically targeted. Together, our work elucidates the lineage-determining properties of chromatin factors across normal and malignant hematopoiesis.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37657044","Comprehensive analysis of the prognostic values and immune implication of ESYT3 in lung adenocarcinoma.","Medicine (Baltimore)","Few studies have reported the association between ESYT3 and tumors. The purpose of this study was to investigate the molecular features and potential roles of ESYT3 in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). In the present study, GEPIA, UALCAN, TCGA databases, and KM Plotter were primarily used to study ESYT3 mRNA expression profiles and prognostic values in patients with LUAD. Then we evaluated co-expressed genes of ESYT3 by cBioPortal online tools and performed enrichment analysis using Metascape. Moreover, the relationship between ESYT3 and immune infiltrating cells was explored via TIMER2, and MethSurv database was used to conduct methylation analysis. We found ESYT3 was downregulated in LUAD tissues based on TCGA and GEPIA databases. Low expression of ESYT3 mRNA was observed to be significantly correlated with N classification and stage classification. GEPIA2, UALCAN databases and KM Plotter showed that low expression levels of ESYT3 was associated with poor survival in LUAD patients. The enrichment analysis indicated that co-expressed genes of ESYT3 were highly enriched in cell division. Then, our study showed ESYT3 was correlated with immune infiltration and immune checkpoints. Additionally, hypomethylation was associated with low ESYT3 expression and poor prognosis in LUAD. In conclusion, this study suggested ESYT3 could be a potential prognostic marker and a promising therapeutic target in LUAD.Copyright © 2023 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc."

However, this molecule has had an overwhelming presence in scientific research for decades until the arrival of high-throughput studies. Several appealing properties justify the application of mtDNA to understand how human populations are-from a genetic perspective-and how individuals exhibit phenotypes of biomedical importance. Here, I review the basics of mitochondrial studies with a focus on the dawn of the field, analysis methods and the connection between two sides of mitochondrial genetics: anthropological and biomedical. The particularities of mtDNA, with respect to inheritance pattern, evolutionary rate and dependence on the nuclear genome, explain the challenges of associating mtDNA composition and diseases.

In this study, we integrated gene expression, DNA methylation, and genome variants from the iMETHYL database using the recently proposed kernel tensor decomposition-based unsupervised feature extraction method with limited computational resources (i.e., short CPU time and small memory requirements). Our methods do not require prior knowledge of the subjects because they are fully unsupervised in that unsupervised tensor decomposition is used. The selected genes and genomic variants were significantly targeted by transcription factors that were biologically enriched in KEGG pathway terms as well as in the intra-related regulatory network. The proposed method is promising for integrated analyses of gene expression, methylation, and genomic variants with limited computational resources.Copyright: © 2023 Taguchi et al.

It is critical to detect and accurately diagnose the disease early to improve survival rates. Tumor markers have emerged as valuable tools in the diagnosis and management of OC, offering non-invasive and cost-effective options for screening, monitoring, and prognosis.This paper explores the diagnostic importance of various tumor markers including CA-125, CA15-3, CA 19-9, HE4,hCG, inhibin, AFP, and LDH, and their impact on disease monitoring and treatment response assessment.Article searches were performed on PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Keywords used for the searching process were ""Ovarian cancer"", ""Cancer biomarkers"", ""Early detection"", ""Cancer diagnosis"", ""CA-125"",""CA 15-3"",""CA 19-9"", ""HE4"",""hCG"", ""inhibin"", ""AFP"", ""LDH"", and others.HE4, when combined with CA-125, shows improved sensitivity and specificity, particularly in early-stage detection. Additionally, hCG holds promise as a prognostic marker, aiding treatment response prediction and outcome assessment. Novel markers like microRNAs, DNA methylation patterns, and circulating tumor cells offer potential for enhanced diagnostic accuracy and personalized management. Integrating these markers into a comprehensive panel may improve sensitivity and specificity in ovarian cancer diagnosis. However, careful interpretation of tumor marker results is necessary, considering factors such as age, menopausal status, and comorbidities. Further research is needed to validate and refine diagnostic algorithms, optimizing the clinical significance of tumor markers in ovarian cancer management. In conclusion, tumor markers such as CA-125, CA15-3, CA 19-9, HE4, and hCG provide valuable insights into ovarian cancer diagnosis, monitoring, and prognosis, with the potential to enhance early detection."
"37628794","The Future of Precision Oncology.","Int J Mol Sci","Our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer development and evolution have evolved rapidly over recent years, and the variation from one patient to another is now widely recognized. Consequently, one-size-fits-all approaches to the treatment of cancer have been superseded by precision medicines that target specific disease characteristics, promising maximum clinical efficacy, minimal safety concerns, and reduced economic burden. While precision oncology has been very successful in the treatment of some tumors with specific characteristics, a large number of patients do not yet have access to precision medicines for their disease. The success of next-generation precision oncology depends on the discovery of new actionable disease characteristics, rapid, accurate, and comprehensive diagnosis of complex phenotypes within each patient, novel clinical trial designs with improved response rates, and worldwide access to novel targeted anticancer therapies for all patients. This review outlines some of the current technological trends, and highlights some of the complex multidisciplinary efforts that are underway to ensure that many more patients with cancer will be able to benefit from precision oncology in the near future."
"37608214","Early detection of lung cancer using artificial intelligence-enhanced optical nanosensing of chromatin alterations in field carcinogenesis.","Sci Rep","Supranucleosomal chromatin structure, including chromatin domain conformation, is involved in the regulation of gene expression and its dysregulation has been associated with carcinogenesis. Prior studies have shown that cells in the buccal mucosa carry a molecular signature of lung cancer among the cigarette-smoking population, the phenomenon known as field carcinogenesis or field of injury. Thus, we hypothesized that chromatin structural changes in buccal mucosa can be predictive of lung cancer. However, the small size of the chromatin chain (approximately 20 nm) folded into chromatin packing domains, themselves typically below 300 nm in diameter, preclude the detection of alterations in intradomain chromatin conformation using diffraction-limited optical microscopy. In this study, we developed an optical spectroscopic statistical nanosensing technique to detect chromatin packing domain changes in buccal mucosa as a lung cancer biomarker: chromatin-sensitive partial wave spectroscopic microscopy (csPWS). Artificial intelligence (AI) was applied to csPWS measurements of chromatin alterations to enhance diagnostic performance. Our AI-enhanced buccal csPWS nanocytology of 179 patients at two clinical sites distinguished Stage-I lung cancer versus cancer-free controls with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.92 ± 0.06 for Site 1 (in-state location) and 0.82 ± 0.11 for Site 2 (out-of-state location).© 2023.

However, high-quality DNA methylation sequencing has been challenging because poor sequence diversity of the bisulfite-converted libraries severely impairs sequencing quality and yield. In this study, we tested MGISEQ-2000 Sequencer's capability of DNA methylation sequencing with a published non-invasive pancreatic cancer detection assay, using NovaSeq6000 as the benchmark.We sequenced a series of synthetic cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples with different tumor fractions and found MGISEQ-2000 yielded data with similar quality as NovaSeq6000. The methylation levels measured by MGISEQ-2000 demonstrated high consistency with NovaSeq6000. Moreover, MGISEQ-2000 showed a comparable analytic sensitivity with NovaSeq6000, suggesting its potential for clinical detection. As to evaluate the clinical performance of MGISEQ-2000, we sequenced 24 clinical samples and predicted the pathology of the samples with a clinical diagnosis model, PDACatch classifier. The clinical model performance of MGISEQ-2000's data was highly consistent with that of NovaSeq6000's data, with the area under the curve of 1. We also tested the model's robustness with MGISEQ-2000's data when reducing the sequencing depth. The results showed that MGISEQ-2000's data showed matching robustness of the PDACatch classifier with NovaSeq6000's data.Taken together, MGISEQ-2000 demonstrated similar data quality, consistency of the methylation levels, comparable analytic sensitivity, and matching clinical performance, supporting its application in future non-invasive early cancer detection investigations by detecting distinct methylation patterns of cfDNAs.© 2023.

"37560387","An overview of DNA methylation markers for early detection of gastric cancer: current status, challenges, and prospects.","Front Genet","Background:Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common malignancies, with a low 5-year survival rate. However, if diagnosed at an early stage, it can be cured by endoscopic treatment and has a good prognosis. While gastrointestinal X-ray and upper endoscopy are used as national GC screening methods in some GC high-risk countries, such as Japan and Korea, their radiation exposure, invasiveness, and high cost suggest that they are not the optimal tools for early detection of GC in many countries. Therefore, a cost-effective, and highly accurate method for GC early detection is urgently needed in clinical settings. DNA methylation plays a key role in cancer progression and metastasis and has been demonstrated as a promising marker for cancer early detection.Aims and methods:This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current status of DNA methylation markers associated with GC, the assays developed for GC early detection, challenges in methylation marker discovery and application, and the future prospects of utilizing methylation markers for early detection of GC. Through our analysis, we found that the currently reported DNA methylation markers related to GC are mainly in the early discovery stage. Most of them have only been evaluated in tissue samples. The majority of non-invasive assays developed based on blood lack standardized sampling protocols, pre-analytical procedures, and multicenter validation, and they exhibit insufficient sensitivity for early-stage GC detection. Meanwhile, the reported GC DNA methylation markers are generally considered pan-cancer markers.Conclusion:Therefore, future endeavors should focus on identifying additional methylation markers specific to GC and establishing non-invasive diagnostic assays that rely on these markers. These assays should undergo multicenter, large-scale prospective validation in diverse populations.Copyright © 2023 Xue, Huang, Pei, Wang and Dai."

The recognition and effects of CTCF on DNA sequences, chromosome barriers, and enhancer blocking are not well understood. Existing computational tools struggle to assess the regulatory potential of CTCF-binding sites and their impact on chromatin loop formation. Here we have developed a deep-learning model, DeepAnchor, to accurately characterize CTCF binding using high-resolution genomic/epigenomic features. This has revealed distinct chromatin and sequence patterns for CTCF-mediated insulation and looping. An optimized implementation of a previous loop model based on DeepAnchor score excels in predicting CTCF-anchored loops. We have established a compendium of CTCF-anchored loops across 52 human tissue/cell types, and this suggests that genomic disruption of these loops could be a general mechanism of disease pathogenesis.

However, the structural characteristics of lung cancer still remain uncovered. In this study, we used high-throughput chromosome (Hi-C) conformation capture technology to detect the advanced structural variations in chromatin of two non-smoking lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) tumor and paired normal tissues. The results indicate that significant chromatin variations are detected in tumor tissues compared with normal tissues. At compartment scale, the main conversion type of compartment is A → B in tumor tissues, which are concentrated mainly on chromosome 3 (Chr3) (33.6%). A total of 216 tumor-specific TADs are identified in tumor tissues, which are distributed mainly in Chr1 (19), Chr2 (15) and Chr3 (17). Forty-one distinct enhancer-promoter loops are observed in tumor tissue, which are associated closely to tumor-related pathways including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-Protein kinase B (PI3K-AKT), Ras, Wnt and Ras1. The most important observation in this study is that we identify five important genes (SYT16,NCEH1,NXPE3,MB21D2, andDZIP1L), which are detected in both A → B compartment, TADs and chromatin loops in tumor samples, and four of these genes (NCEH1,NXPE3,MB21D2, andDZIP1L) locate on q arm of Chr3. Further gene expression and invasion experiment analysis show thatNCEH1,MB21D2andSYT16are involved in the tumor development. Thus, we provide a comprehensive overview of advanced structures in LUAD for the first time and provide a basis for further research on the genetic variation of this tumor.© International Human Phenome Institutes (Shanghai) 2023.

"37546906",NA,NA,"The identification of cell-type-specific 3D chromatin interactions between regulatory elements can help to decipher gene regulation and to interpret the function of disease-associated non-coding variants. However, current chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies are unable to resolve interactions at this resolution when only small numbers of cells are available as input. We therefore present ChromaFold, a deep learning model that predicts 3D contact maps and regulatory interactions from single-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq) data alone. ChromaFold uses pseudobulk chromatin accessibility, co-accessibility profiles across metacells, and predicted CTCF motif tracks as input features and employs a lightweight architecture to enable training on standard GPUs. Once trained on paired scATAC-seq and Hi-C data in human cell lines and tissues, ChromaFold can accurately predict both the 3D contact map and peak-level interactions across diverse human and mouse test cell types. In benchmarking against a recent deep learning method that uses bulk ATAC-seq, DNA sequence, and CTCF ChIP-seq to make cell-type-specific predictions, ChromaFold yields superior prediction performance when including CTCF ChIP-seq data as an input and comparable performance without. Finally, fine-tuning ChromaFold on paired scATAC-seq and Hi-C in a complex tissue enables deconvolution of chromatin interactions across cell subpopulations. ChromaFold thus achieves state-of-the-art prediction of 3D contact maps and regulatory interactions using scATAC-seq alone as input data, enabling accurate inference of cell-type-specific interactions in settings where 3C-based assays are infeasible."

We aimed to characterize and analyze the temporal trends of sepsis-related mortality in China, by population groups, underlying causes of death, geographic regions, and sociodemographic index (SDI) levels.Sepsis-related deaths were identified from the National Mortality Surveillance System (NMSS) of China from 2006 to 2020. Trends of sepsis-related mortality and years of life lost (YLLs), stratified by age, sex, underlying diseases, and regions were analyzed using the Jointpoint regression analysis. We investigated the association of SDI with trends of sepsis-related mortality.In 2020, sepsis was estimated to be responsible for 986,929 deaths and 17.1 million YLLs in China. Age-standardized sepsis-related mortality significantly declined from 130.2 (95%CI, 129.4-131) per 100,000 population in 2006 to 76.6 (76.3-76.9) in 2020.

Many studies have established various biomarkers to predict ICB responses. However, different biomarkers were found with diverse performances in practice, and a timely and unbiased assessment has yet to be conducted due to the complexity of ICB-related studies and trials. In this study, we manually curated 29 published datasets with matched transcriptome and clinical data from more than 1400 patients, and uniformly preprocessed these datasets for further analyses. In addition, we collected 39 sets of transcriptomic biomarkers, and based on the nature of the corresponding computational methods, we categorized them into the gene-set-like group (with the self-contained design and the competitive design, respectively) and the deconvolution-like group. Next, we investigated the correlations and patterns of these biomarkers and utilized a standardized workflow to systematically evaluate their performance in predicting ICB responses and survival statuses across different datasets, cancer types, antibodies, biopsy times, and combinatory treatments. In our benchmark, most biomarkers showed poor performance in terms of stability and robustness across different datasets. Two scores (TIDE and CYT) had a competitive performance for ICB response prediction, and two others (PASS-ON and EIGS_ssGSEA) showed the best association with clinical outcome. Finally, we developed ICB-Portal to host the datasets, biomarkers, and benchmark results and to implement the computational methods for researchers to test their custom biomarkers.

In this study, we performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing from patients with heart failure who recovered left ventricular systolic function after left ventricular assist device implantation, patients who did not recover and non-diseased donors. We identified cell-specific transcriptional signatures of recovery, most prominently in macrophages and fibroblasts. Within these cell types, inflammatory signatures were negative predictors of recovery, and downregulation of RUNX1 was associated with recovery. In silico perturbation of RUNX1 in macrophages and fibroblasts recapitulated the transcriptional state of recovery. Cardiac recovery mediated by BET inhibition in mice led to decreased macrophage and fibroblast Runx1 expression and diminished chromatin accessibility within a Runx1 intronic peak and acquisition of human recovery signatures. These findings suggest that cardiac recovery is a unique biological state and identify RUNX1 as a possible therapeutic target to facilitate cardiac recovery."

Nrf2-dependent phase II gene promoters are controlled by coordinated recruitment of the AhR to adjacent dioxin responsive element (DRE) and Nrf2 recruitment to the antioxidative response element (ARE). The molecular interaction between AhR and Nrf2 members, and the regulation of each target, including phase I and II gene complexes, and their mediators are poorly understood.Knockdown and forced expression of AhR-Nrf2 battery members were used to examine the molecular interactions between the AhR-Nrf2 axis and AhR promoter activation. Sequential immunoprecipitation, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and histology were used to identify each protein complex recruited to their respective cis-elements in the AhR promoter. Actin fiber distribution, cell spreading, and invasion were examined to identify functional differences in the AhR-Jdp2 axis between wild-type and Jdp2 knockout cells. The possible tumorigenic role of Jdp2 in the AhR-Nrf2 axis was examined in mutant Kras-Trp53-driven pancreatic tumors.Crosstalk between AhR and Nrf2 was evident at the transcriptional level. The AhR promoter was activated by phase I ligands such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) through the AhR-Jdp2-Nrf2 axis in a time- and spatial transcription-dependent manner. Jdp2 was a bifunctional activator of DRE- and ARE-mediated transcription in response to TCDD. After TCDD exposure, Jdp2 activated the AhR promoter at the DRE and then moved to the ARE where it activated the promoter to increase reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated functions such as cell spreading and invasion in normal cells, and cancer regression in mutant Kras-Trp53-driven pancreatic tumor cells.Jdp2 plays a critical role in AhR promoter activation through the AhR-Jdp2-Nrf2 axis in a spatiotemporal manner. The AhR functions to maintain ROS balance and cell spreading, invasion, and cancer regression in a mouse model of mutant Kras-Trp53 pancreatic cancer. These findings provide new insights into the roles of Jdp2 in the homeostatic regulation of oxidative stress and in the antioxidation response in detoxification, inflammation, and cancer progression.© 2023.

In this study, we employed cell-type deconvolution and single-cell signatures to analyze bulk RNA-seq from multiple transcriptomic studies, aiming to characterize the cellular composition of brain lesions in patients with FCD IIa and IIb subtypes. Our deconvolution analyses revealed specific cellular changes in FCD IIb, including neuronal loss and an increase in reactive astrocytes (astrogliosis) when compared to FCD IIa. Astrogliosis in FCD IIb was further supported by a gene signature analysis and histologically confirmed by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunostaining. Overall, our findings demonstrate that FCD II subtypes exhibit differential neuronal and glial compositions, with astrogliosis emerging as a hallmark of FCD IIb.

The study sample consisted of 159 healthy, non-smoking men with a mean age of 35.24 (SD 3.44) years. Birth weight and length were taken from medical records. The ponderal index at birth was calculated. Biological age was evaluated based on serum levels of s-Klotho, hsCRP, DHEA/S, and oxidative stress markers. Pregnancy age at birth, lifestyle, weight, cortisol, and testosterone levels were controlled. The results showed no relationship between birth size and s-Klotho, DHEA/S level, inflammation, or oxidative stress. Also, men born as small-for-gestational-age (N = 49) and men born as appropriate-for-gestational-age (N = 110) did not differ in terms of biological age markers levels.

"37560445","Artificial intelligence vs. evolving super-complex tumor intelligence: critical viewpoints.","Front Artif Intell","Recent developments in various domains have led to a growing interest in the potential of artificial intelligence to enhance our lives and environments. In particular, the application of artificial intelligence in the management of complex human diseases, such as cancer, has garnered significant attention. The evolution of artificial intelligence is thought to be influenced by multiple factors, including human intervention and environmental factors. Similarly, tumors, being heterogeneous and complex diseases, continue to evolve due to changes in the physical, chemical, and biological environment. Additionally, the concept of cellular intelligence within biological systems has been recognized as a potential attribute of biological entities. Therefore, it is plausible that the tumor intelligence present in cancer cells of affected individuals could undergo super-evolution due to changes in the pro-tumor environment. Thus, a comparative analysis of the evolution of artificial intelligence and super-complex tumor intelligence could yield valuable insights to develop better artificial intelligence-based tools for cancer management.Copyright © 2023 Sharma and Sarode."
"37627102","Variant Characterization of a Representative Large Pedigree Suggests ""Variant Risk Clusters"" Convey Varying Predisposition of Risk to Lynch Syndrome.","Cancers (Basel)","Recently, worldwide incidences of young adult aggressive colorectal cancer (CRC) have rapidly increased. Of these incidences diagnosed as familial Lynch syndrome (LS) CRC, outcomes are extremely poor. In this study, we seek novel familial germline variants from a large pedigree Tunisian family with 12 LS-affected individuals to identify putative germline variants associated with varying risk of LS. Whole-genome sequencing analysis was performed to identify known and novel germline variants shared between affected and non-affected pedigree members. SNPs, indels, and structural variants (SVs) were computationally identified, and their oncological influence was predicted using the Genetic Association of Complex Diseases and Disorders, OncoKB, and My Cancer Genome databases. Of 94 germline familial variants identified with predicted functional impact, 37 SNPs/indels were detected in 28 genes, 2 of which (MLH1 and PRH1-TAS2R14) have known association with CRC and 4 others (PPP1R13B, LAMA5, FTO, and NLRP14) have known association with non-CRC cancers. In addition, 48 of 57 identified SVs overlap with 43 genes. Three of these genes (RELN, IRS2, and FOXP1) have a known association with non-CRC digestive cancers and one (RRAS2) has a known association with non-CRC cancer. Our study identified 83 novel, predicted functionally impactful germline variants grouped in three ""variant risk clusters"" shared in three familiarly associated LS groups (high, intermediate and low risk). This variant characterization study demonstrates that large pedigree investigations provide important evidence supporting the hypothesis that different ""variant risk clusters"" can convey different mechanisms of risk and oncogenesis of LS-CRC even within the same pedigree."

Participants were from the Health and Aging Brain Study-Health Disparities, which is a community-based single-center study in the Dallas/Fort Worth area of Texas. A total of 1614 Mexican American and non-Hispanic White adults 50 years and older were included.Neighborhood disadvantage for participants' current residence was measured by the validated Area Deprivation Index (ADI); ADI Texas state deciles were converted to quintiles, with quintile 1 representing the least disadvantaged area and quintile 5 the most disadvantaged area. Covariates included age, sex, and educational level.Performance on cognitive tests assessing memory, language, attention, processing speed, and executive functioning; measures included the Spanish-English Verbal Learning Test (SEVLT) Learning and Delayed Recall subscales; Wechsler Memory Scale, third edition (WMS-III) Digit Span Forward, Digit Span Backward, and Logical Memory 1 and 2 subscales; Trail Making Test (TMT) parts A and B; Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST); Letter Fluency; and Animal Naming. Raw scores were used for analyses. Associations between neighborhood disadvantage and neuropsychological performance were examined via demographically adjusted linear regression models stratified by ethnic group.Among 1614 older adults (mean [SD] age, 66.3 [8.7] years; 980 women [60.7%]), 853 were Mexican American (mean [SD] age, 63.9 [7.9] years; 566 women [66.4%]), and 761 were non-Hispanic White (mean [SD] age, 69.1 [8.7] years; 414 women [54.4%]). Older Mexican American adults were more likely to reside in the most disadvantaged areas (ADI quintiles 3-5), with 280 individuals (32.8%) living in ADI quintile 5, whereas a large proportion of older non-Hispanic White adults resided in ADI quintile 1 (296 individuals [38.9%]). Mexican American individuals living in more disadvantaged areas had worse performance than those living in ADI quintile 1 on 7 of 11 cognitive tests, including SEVLT Learning (ADI quintile 5: β = -2.50; 95% CI, -4.46 to -0.54), SEVLT Delayed Recall (eg, ADI quintile 3: β = -1.11; 95% CI, -1.97 to -0.24), WMS-III Digit Span Forward (eg, ADI quintile 4: β = -1.14; 95% CI, -1.60 to -0.67), TMT part A (ADI quintile 5: β = 7.85; 95% CI, 1.28-14.42), TMT part B (eg, ADI quintile 5: β = 31.5; 95% CI, 12.16-51.35), Letter Fluency (ADI quintile 4: β = -2.91; 95% CI, -5.39 to -0.43), and DSST (eg, ADI quintile 5: β = -4.45; 95% CI, -6.77 to -2.14). In contrast, only non-Hispanic White individuals living in ADI quintile 4 had worse performance than those living in ADI quintile 1 on 4 of 11 cognitive tests, including SEVLT Learning (β = -2.35; 95% CI, -4.40 to -0.30), SEVLT Delayed Recall (β = -0.95; 95% CI, -1.73 to -0.17), TMT part B (β = 15.95; 95% CI, 2.47-29.44), and DSST (β = -3.96; 95% CI, -6.49 to -1.43).In this cross-sectional study, aging in a disadvantaged area was associated with worse cognitive functioning, particularly for older Mexican American adults. Future studies examining the implications of exposure to neighborhood disadvantage across the life span will be important for improving cognitive outcomes in diverse populations."

This requires the permanent labelling of CAR T cell products and their pooling in the same microenvironment. Here, we report a cell-barcoding method for the multiplexed longitudinal profiling of cells in vivo using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). The method, which we named shielded-small-nucleotide-based scRNA-seq (SSN-seq), is compatible with both 3' and 5' single-cell profiling, and enables the recording of cell identity, from cell infusion to isolation, by leveraging the ubiquitous Pol III U6 promoters to robustly express small-RNA barcodes modified with direct-capture sequences. By using SSN-seq to track the dynamics of the states of CAR T cells in a tumour-rechallenge mouse model of leukaemia, we found that a combination of cytokines and small-molecule inhibitors that are used in the ex vivo manufacturing of CAR T cells promotes the in vivo expansion of persistent populations of CD4+memory T cells. By facilitating the probing of cell-state dynamics in vivo, SSN-seq may aid the development of adoptive cell therapies.© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited."
"37590228","The specious art of single-cell genomics.","PLoS Comput Biol","Dimensionality reduction is standard practice for filtering noise and identifying relevant features in large-scale data analyses. In biology, single-cell genomics studies typically begin with reduction to 2 or 3 dimensions to produce ""all-in-one"" visuals of the data that are amenable to the human eye, and these are subsequently used for qualitative and quantitative exploratory analysis. However, there is little theoretical support for this practice, and we show that extreme dimension reduction, from hundreds or thousands of dimensions to 2, inevitably induces significant distortion of high-dimensional datasets. We therefore examine the practical implications of low-dimensional embedding of single-cell data and find that extensive distortions and inconsistent practices make such embeddings counter-productive for exploratory, biological analyses. In lieu of this, we discuss alternative approaches for conducting targeted embedding and feature exploration to enable hypothesis-driven biological discovery.Copyright: © 2023 Chari, Pachter.

"37523521","Quantifying common and distinct information in single-cell multimodal data with Tilted Canonical Correlation Analysis.","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","Multimodal single-cell technologies profile multiple modalities for each cell simultaneously, enabling a more thorough characterization of cell populations. Existing dimension-reduction methods for multimodal data capture the ""union of information,"" producing a lower-dimensional embedding that combines the information across modalities. While these tools are useful, we focus on a fundamentally different task of separating and quantifying the information among cells that is shared between the two modalities as well as unique to only one modality. Hence, we develop Tilted Canonical Correlation Analysis (Tilted-CCA), a method that decomposes a paired multimodal dataset into three lower-dimensional embeddings-one embedding captures the ""intersection of information,"" representing the geometric relations among the cells that is common to both modalities, while the remaining two embeddings capture the ""distinct information for a modality,"" representing the modality-specific geometric relations. We analyze single-cell multimodal datasets sequencing RNA along surface antibodies (i.e., CITE-seq) as well as RNA alongside chromatin accessibility (i.e., 10x) for blood cells and developing neurons via Tilted-CCA. These analyses show that Tilted-CCA enables meaningful visualization and quantification of the cross-modal information. Finally, Tilted-CCA's framework allows us to perform two specific downstream analyses. First, for single-cell datasets that simultaneously profile transcriptome and surface antibody markers, we show that Tilted-CCA helps design the target antibody panel to complement the transcriptome best. Second, for developmental single-cell datasets that simultaneously profile transcriptome and chromatin accessibility, we show that Tilted-CCA helps identify development-informative genes and distinguish between transient versus terminal cell types."
"37600846","Cobind: quantitative analysis of the genomic overlaps.","Bioinform Adv","Analyzing the overlap between two sets of genomic intervals is a frequent task in the field of bioinformatics. Typically, this is accomplished by counting the number (or proportion) of overlapped regions, which applies an arbitrary threshold to determine if two genomic intervals are overlapped. By making binary calls but disregarding the magnitude of the overlap, such an approach often leads to biased, non-reproducible, and incomparable results.We developed the cobind package, which incorporates six statistical measures: the Jaccard coefficient, Sørensen-Dice coefficient, Szymkiewicz-Simpson coefficient, collocation coefficient, pointwise mutual information (PMI), and normalized PMI. These measures allow for a quantitative assessment of the collocation strength between two sets of genomic intervals. To demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods, we applied them to analyze CTCF's binding sites identified from ChIP-seq, cancer-specific open-chromatin regions (OCRs) identified from ATAC-seq of 17 cancer types, and oligodendrocytes-specific OCRs identified from scATAC-seq. Our results indicated that these new approaches effectively re-discover CTCF's cofactors, as well as cancer-specific and oligodendrocytes-specific master regulators implicated in disease and cell type development.The cobind package is implemented in Python and freely available at https://cobind.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.© The Author(s) 2023.

"37580817","Dissection of transcriptomic and epigenetic heterogeneity of grade 4 gliomas: implications for prognosis.","Acta Neuropathol Commun","Grade 4 glioma is the most aggressive and currently incurable brain tumor with a median survival of one year in adult patients. Elucidating novel transcriptomic and epigenetic contributors to the molecular heterogeneity underlying its aggressiveness may lead to improved clinical outcomes.To identify grade 4 glioma -associated 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and transcriptomic features as well as their cross-talks, genome-wide 5hmC and transcriptomic profiles of tissue samples from 61 patients with grade 4 gliomas and 9 normal controls were obtained for differential and co-regulation/co-modification analyses. Prognostic models on overall survival based on transcriptomic features and the 5hmC modifications summarized over genic regions (promoters, gene bodies) and brain-derived histone marks were developed using machine learning algorithms.Despite global reduction, the majority of differential 5hmC features showed higher modification levels in grade 4 gliomas as compared to normal controls. In addition, the bi-directional correlations between 5hmC modifications over promoter regions or gene bodies and gene expression were greatly disturbed in grade 4 gliomas regardless of IDH1 mutation status. Phenotype-associated co-regulated 5hmC-5hmC modules and 5hmC-mRNA modules not only are enriched with different molecular pathways that are indicative of the pathogenesis of grade 4 gliomas, but also are of prognostic significance comparable to IDH1 mutation status. Lastly, the best-performing 5hmC model can predict patient survival at a much higher accuracy (c-index = 74%) when compared to conventional prognostic factor IDH1 (c-index = 57%), capturing the molecular characteristics of tumors that are independent of IDH1 mutation status and gene expression-based molecular subtypes.The 5hmC-based prognostic model could offer a robust tool to predict survival in patients with grade 4 gliomas, potentially outperforming existing prognostic factors such as IDH1 mutations. The crosstalk between 5hmC and gene expression revealed another layer of complexity underlying the molecular heterogeneity in grade 4 gliomas, offering opportunities for identifying novel therapeutic targets.© 2023.

"37629335",NA,NA,"The need to improve health outcomes, as well as disease prognosis, has led clinicians and researchers to propose new ways of identifying COPD in its earliest forms. This initiative is based on the hypothesis that an earlier intervention would have a greater prognostic impact. However, the operational definition of a patient in the initial stages of the disease is complex, and there is still no unanimously accepted definition. GOLD has recently proposed different concepts to identify COPD in its early stages, such as COPD in young people or COPD with mild functional impairment. In addition, GOLD proposes two other concepts, called pre-COPD (symptomatic non-obstructive patients) and PRISm (preserved ratio with impaired spirometry), which aim to identify the patient at risk of developing this chronic airflow obstruction. However, despite the attractiveness of these concepts, none have been taken up universally by the medical community. A universally accepted identification of how to define COPD in its early stages is necessary as a preliminary step in order to design clinical trials to find out the best way to treat these patients. This review deals with these concepts of COPD at the onset of the disease, highlighting their importance and the problems involved in identifying them as therapeutic targets in real clinical practice."
"37653545",NA,NA,"Variant transthyretin amyloidosis (A-ATTRv) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by a range of TTR gene variants which entail great phenotypical heterogeneity and penetrance. In Majorca, the A-ATTRv caused by the V30M gene variant (A-ATTRV30M) is the most common. Since asymptomatic carriers are at risk of developing the disease, estimating age of onset is vital for proper management and follow-up. Thus, the aim of this study was to estimate age-related penetrance in ATTRV30M variant carriers from Majorca.The disease risk among carriers from ATTRV30M families from Majorca was estimated by Non-parametric survival estimation. Factors potentially involved in the disease expression, namely gender and parent of origin were also analysed.A total of 48 heterozygous ATTRV30M families (147 affected patients and 123 were asymptomatic carriers) were included in the analysis. Penetrance progressively increased from 6% at 30 years to 75% at 90 years of age. In contrast to other European populations, we observe a similar risk for both males and females, and no difference of risk according to the parent of origin.In this first study assessing the age-related penetrance of ATTRV30M variant in Majorcan families, no effect of gender or parent of origin was observed.

Based on recent strategies that combined long-read sequencing and exogenous enzymatic labelling of open chromatin, we developed single-molecule targeted accessibility and methylation sequencing (STAM-seq) in plants by further integrating nanopore adaptive sampling to investigate the HRRs in wild-type Arabidopsis and DNA methylation mutants that are defective in CG- or non-CG methylation. We found that CEN180 repeats show higher chromatin accessibility and lower DNA methylation on their forward strand, individual rDNA units show a negative correlation between their DNA methylation and accessibility, and both accessibility and CHH methylation levels are lower at telomere compared to adjacent subtelomeric region. Moreover, DNA methylation-deficient mutants showed increased chromatin accessibility at HRRs, consistent with the role of DNA methylation in maintaining heterochromatic status in plants.

However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms that contribute to protecting RGCs and their axons from injuries are not completely known. Here, we identify that Porf-2, a member of the Rho GTPase activating protein gene group, is upregulated in RGCs after optic nerve crush. Knockdown of Porf-2 protects RGCs from apoptosis and promotes long-distance optic nerve regeneration after crush injury in both young and aged mice in vivo. In vitro, we find that inhibition of Porf-2 induces axon growth and growth cone formation in retinal explants. Inhibition of Porf-2 provides long-term and post-injury protection to RGCs and eventually promotes the recovery of visual function after crush injury in mice. These findings reveal a neuroprotective impact of the inhibition of Porf-2 on RGC survival and axon regeneration after optic nerve injury, providing a potential therapeutic strategy for vision restoration in patients with traumatic optic neuropathy.© 2023.

"37634152","Chaotic aging: intrinsically disordered proteins in aging-related processes.","Cell Mol Life Sci","The development of aging is associated with the disruption of key cellular processes manifested as well-established hallmarks of aging. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) have no stable tertiary structure that provide them a power to be configurable hubs in signaling cascades and regulate many processes, potentially including those related to aging. There is a need to clarify the roles of IDPs/IDRs in aging. The dataset of 1702 aging-related proteins was collected from established aging databases and experimental studies. There is a noticeable presence of IDPs/IDRs, accounting for about 36% of the aging-related dataset, which is however less than the disorder content of the whole human proteome (about 40%). A Gene Ontology analysis of the used here aging proteome reveals an abundance of IDPs/IDRs in one-third of aging-associated processes, especially in genome regulation. Signaling pathways associated with aging also contain IDPs/IDRs on different hierarchical levels, revealing the importance of ""structure-function continuum"" in aging. Protein-protein interaction network analysis showed that IDPs present in different clusters associated with different aging hallmarks. Protein cluster with IDPs enrichment has simultaneously high liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) probability, ""nuclear"" localization and DNA-associated functions, related to aging hallmarks: genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, and stem cells exhaustion. Intrinsic disorder, LLPS, and aggregation propensity should be considered as features that could be markers of pathogenic proteins. Overall, our analyses indicate that IDPs/IDRs play significant roles in aging-associated processes, particularly in the regulation of DNA functioning. IDP aggregation, which can lead to loss of function and toxicity, could be critically harmful to the cell. A structure-based analysis of aging and the identification of proteins that are particularly susceptible to disturbances can enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of aging and open up new avenues for slowing it down.© 2023.

We investigated the relationship between inflammatory biomarkers and the risk of developing delirium.A bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was performed. Genetic instruments associated with peripheral tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-8, IL-6, soluble IL-6 receptor alpha (sIL-6Rα), and soluble gp130 were identified in three different large summary genome-wide association studies (GWAS) conducted in the European population. Summary-level statistics for delirium not induced by alcohol and other psychoactive substances were obtained from the FinnGen consortium (2,612 cases and 325,306 controls). The estimated causal effects were performed using instruments' variants at the genome-wide significant level (P< 5e-8 andP< 5e-6), applying a linkage disequilibrium clumping approach with a threshold ofr2< 0.001 for each of the exposures. Reverse causation was also performed. The inverse-variance weighted method (IVW), MR-Egger method, weighted median method, MR-Egger regression, and MR Pleiotropy RESidual Sum were used for MR analyses.At the genome-wide significant level (P< 5e-8,r2< 0.001), genetically predicted sIL-6Rα was significantly associated with a decreased risk of delirium with less than three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in all three GWAS data sources (ORWaldratio= 0.89, 95% CI: 0.79-0.96,PWaldratio= 0.0016; ORIVW= 0.88, 95% CI: 0.79-0.97,PIVW= 0.008; ORIVW= 0.88, 95% CI: 0.80-0.96,PIVW= 0.004). The causal relationship between sIL-6Rα and delirium became non-significant when a more liberal threshold ofPof < 5e-6 was applied (allPIVW> 0.05). At the two genome-wide significance levels (P< 5e-8 andP< 5e-6), we found no evidence for the causal effects of peripheral TNF-α, CRP, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, and soluble gp130 on delirium (allP> 0.05). The MR-Egger intercept and MR-PRESSO results indicated that no SNP had possible pleiotropy (allP> 0.05). Regarding the reverse, no evidence for an effect of delirium on these inflammatory biomarkers could be found (allP> 0.05).The results of this MR analysis did not support that peripheral TNF-α, CRP, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, sIL-6Rα, soluble gp130, and IL-8 were causally associated with delirium. More research is needed to explore the role of inflammatory factors in the pathogenesis of delirium.Copyright © 2023 Yu, Li, Li and Ge."

At present, many studies are still disputing whether air pollution is associated with primary liver cancer incidence, and it is difficult to draw causal inferences. Therefore, in this study, we used two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to assess the causal relationship between air pollution (including PM2.5, PM2.5-10, PM10, nitrogen dioxide and nitrogen oxides) and primary liver cancer risk and its related biomarkers (Alpha-fetoprotein, Osteopontin, Glypican-3 and Arginase-1).We used large-scale publicly available genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary data to conduct MR analyses of European and East Asian populations. Inverse variance weighted (IVW) method was used as the main analysis method, and weighted median model, MR-Egger, simple model and weighted model methods were selected for quality control. Heterogeneity was checked by the Cochran's Q test. The MR-Egger regression and the MR-PRESSO global test detect pleiotropy. The sensitivity analysis was performed using the leave-one-out method.Between air pollution and primary liver cancer in either European (PM2.5:p = 0.993; PM2.5-10:p = 0.833; PM10:p = 0.257; nitrogen dioxide:p = 0.215; nitrogen oxides:p = 0.614) or East Asian (PM2.5:p = 0.718; PM2.5-10:p = 0.362; PM10:p = 0.720; nitrogen dioxide:p = 0.101; nitrogen oxides:p = 0.760) populations were found no statistical association. Notably, there was a causal relationship between nitrogen oxides and Arginase-1, a biomarker associated with hepatocellular differentiation, statistically significant associations remained after deletion for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with alcohol intake frequency, Body mass index (BMI) and cancers (Beta: 4.46; 95%CI: 0.83-8.08;p = 0.015).

Here, we investigated the genetic variation underlying aspects of pregnancy-associated bleeding and identified five loci associated with PPH through a meta-analysis of 21,512 cases and 259,500 controls. Functional annotation analysis indicated candidate genes,HAND2,TBX3, andRAP2C/FRMD7,at three loci and showed that at each locus, associated variants were located within binding sites for progesterone receptors (PGR). Furthermore, there were strong genetic correlations with birth weight, gestational duration, and uterine fibroids. Early bleeding during pregnancy (28,898 cases and 302,894 controls) yielded no genome-wide association signals, but showed strong genetic correlation with a variety of human traits, indicative of polygenic and pleiotropic effects. Our results suggest that postpartum bleeding is related to myometrium dysregulation, whereas early bleeding is a complex trait related to underlying health and possibly socioeconomic status."

Mutations and rearrangements on RUNX1 are key drivers of hematological malignancies. In humans, this gene is localized to the 'Down syndrome critical region' of chromosome 21, triplication of which is necessary and sufficient for most phenotypes that characterize Trisomy 21.Individuals with Down syndrome show a higher predisposition to leukemias. Hence, RUNX1 overexpression was initially proposed as a critical player on Down syndrome-associated leukemogenesis. Less is known about the functions of RUNX1 in other tissues and organs, although growing reports show important implications in development or homeostasis of neural tissues, muscle, heart, bone, ovary, or the endothelium, among others. Even less is understood about the consequences on these tissues of RUNX1 gene dosage alterations in the context of Down syndrome. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on RUNX1 activities outside blood/leukemia, while suggesting for the first time their potential relation to specific Trisomy 21 co-occurring conditions.Our concise review on the emerging RUNX1 roles in different tissues outside the hematopoietic context provides a number of well-funded hypotheses that will open new research avenues toward a better understanding of RUNX1-mediated transcription in health and disease, contributing to novel potential diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for Down syndrome-associated conditions.© 2023.

It causes increased inflammation throughout the body and may be complicated by other otolaryngological pathologies such as chronic hyperplastic eosinophilic sinusitis, nasal polyposis, and serous otitis media. Allergic rhinitis is an IgE-mediated disease and immunotherapy can be a possible approach for patients to limit the use of antihistamines and corticosteroids. There is evidence that allergen immunotherapy can prevent the development of new sensitizations and reduce the risk of later development of asthma in patients with allergic rhinitis. However, some patients do not benefit from this approach and the efficacy of immunotherapy in reducing the severity and relapse of symptoms is still a matter of debate. This review highlights new aspects of allergic rhinitis with a particular focus on the impact of sexual dimorphism on the disease manifestation and efficacy to the allergen specific immunotherapy.© 2023 De Carli, Capezzali, Tonon and Frossi."
"37601647","Immunologic, genetic, and ecological interplay of factors involved in allergic diseases.","Front Allergy","An allergic or type I hypersensitivity reaction involves a misdirected immune overreaction to innocuous environmental and dietary antigens called allergens. The genetic predisposition to allergic disease, referred to as atopy, can be expressed as a variety of manifestations-e.g., allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, atopic dermatitis, allergic asthma, anaphylaxis. Globally, allergic diseases are one the most common types of chronic conditions. Several factors have been identified to contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of the disease, leading to distinctively variable clinical symptoms. The factors which can attenuate or exacerbate allergic reactions can range from genetic heterozygosity, the prominence of various comorbid infections, and other factors such as pollution, climate, and interactions with other organisms and organism-derived products, and the surrounding environment. As a result, the effective prevention and control of allergies remains to be one of the most prominent public health problems. Therefore, to contextualize the current knowledge about allergic reactions, this review paper attempts to synthesize different aspects of an allergic response to describe its significance in the global health scheme. Specifically, the review shall characterize the biomolecular mechanisms of the pathophysiology of the disease based on underlying disease theories and current findings on ecologic interactions and describe prevention and control strategies being utilized. An integrated perspective that considers the underlying genetic, immunologic, and ecologic aspects of the disease would enable the development of more effective and targeted diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies for the management and control of allergic diseases.© 2023 Falcon and Caoili."
"37627214",NA,NA,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a hematological disease characterized by the dysfunction of the hematopoietic system that leads to arrest at a specific stage of stem cells development, suppressing the average production of cellular hematologic components. BCP-ALL is a neoplasm of the B-cell lineage progenitor. BCP-ALL is caused and perpetuated by several mechanisms that provide the disease with its tumor potential and genetic and cytological characteristics. These pathological features are used for diagnosis and the prognostication of BCP-ALL. However, most of these paraclinical tools can only be obtained by bone marrow aspiration, which, as it is an invasive study, can delay the diagnosis and follow-up of the disease, in addition to the anesthetic risk it entails for pediatric patients. For this reason, it is crucial to find noninvasive and accessible ways to supply information concerning diagnosis, prognosis, and the monitoring of the disease, such as circulating biomarkers. In oncology, a biomarker is any measurable indicator that demonstrates the presence of malignancy, tumoral behavior, prognosis, or responses to treatments. This review summarizes circulating molecules associated with BCP-ALL with potential diagnostic value, classificatory capacity during monitoring specific clinic features of the disease, and/or capacity to identify each BCP-ALL stage regarding its evolution and outcome of the patients with BCP-ALL. In the same way, we provide and classify biomarkers that may be used in further studies focused on clinical approaches or therapeutic target identification for BCP-ALL."
"37627481","The Evolution and Ecology of Oxidative and Antioxidant Status: A Comparative Approach in African Mole-Rats.","Antioxidants (Basel)","The naked mole-rat of the family Bathyergidae has been the showpiece for ageing research as they contradict the traditional understanding of the oxidative stress theory of ageing. Some other bathyergids also possess increased lifespans, but there has been a remarkable lack of comparison between species within the family Bathyergidae. This study set out to investigate how plasma oxidative markers (total oxidant status (TOS), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and the oxidative stress index (OSI)) differ between five species and three subspecies of bathyergids, differing in their maximum lifespan potential (MLSP), resting metabolic rate, aridity index (AI), and sociality. We also investigated how oxidative markers may differ between captive and wild-caught mole-rats. Our results reveal that increased TOS, TAC, and OSI are associated with increased MLSP. This pattern is more prevalent in the social-living species than the solitary-living species. We also found that oxidative variables decreased with an increasing AI and that wild-caught individuals typically have higher antioxidants. We speculate that the correlation between higher oxidative markers and MLSP is due to the hypoxia-tolerance of the mole-rats investigated. Hormesis (the biphasic response to oxidative stress promoting protection) is a likely mechanism behind the increased oxidative markers observed and promotes longevity in some members of the Bathyergidae family."
"37628641",NA,NA,"Environmental heat stress triggers a series of compensatory mechanisms in sheep that are dependent on their genetic regulation of thermotolerance. Our objective was to identify genes and regulatory pathways associated with thermotolerance in ewes exposed to heat stress. We performed next-generation RNA sequencing on blood collected from 16 pregnant ewes, which were grouped as tolerant and non-tolerant to heat stress according to a physiological indicator. Additional samples were collected to measure complete blood count. A total of 358 differentially expressed genes were identified after applying selection criteria. Gene expression analysis detected 46 GO terms and 52 KEGG functional pathways. The top-three signaling pathways were p53, RIG-I-like receptor and FoxO, which suggested gene participation in biological processes such as apoptosis, cell signaling and immune response to external stressors. Network analysis revealedATM,ISG15,IRF7,MDM4,DHX58andTGFβR1as over-expressed genes with high regulatory potential. A co-expression network involving the immune-related genesISG15,IRF7andDXH58was detected in lymphocytes and monocytes, which was consistent with hematological findings. In conclusion, transcriptomic analysis revealed a non-viral immune mechanism involving apoptosis, which is induced by external stressors and appears to play an important role in the molecular regulation of heat stress tolerance in ewes."
"37644045","Next generation synthetic memory via intercepting recombinase function.","Nat Commun","Here we present a technology to facilitate synthetic memory in a living system via repurposing Transcriptional Programming (i.e., our decision-making technology) parts, to regulate (intercept) recombinase function post-translation. We show that interception synthetic memory can facilitate programmable loss-of-function via site-specific deletion, programmable gain-of-function by way of site-specific inversion, and synthetic memory operations with nested Boolean logical operations. We can expand interception synthetic memory capacity more than 5-fold for a single recombinase, with reconfiguration specificity for multiple sites in parallel. Interception synthetic memory is ~10-times faster than previous generations of recombinase-based memory. We posit that the faster recombination speed of our next-generation memory technology is due to the post-translational regulation of recombinase function. This iteration of synthetic memory is complementary to decision-making via Transcriptional Programming - thus can be used to develop intelligent synthetic biological systems for myriad applications.© 2023.

"37575184","CRISPR interference provides increased cell type-specificity compared to the Cre-loxP system.","iScience","Cre-mediated recombination is frequently used for cell type-specific loss of function (LOF) studies. A major limitation of this system is recombination in unwanted cell types. CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) has been used effectively for global LOF in mice. However, cell type-specific CRISPRi, independent of recombination-based systems, has not been reported. To test the feasibility of cell type-specific CRISPRi, we produced two novel knock-in mouse models that achieve gene suppression when used together: one expressing dCas9::KRAB under the control of a cell type-specific promoter and the other expressing a single guide RNA from a safe harbor locus. We then compared the phenotypes of mice in which the same gene was targeted by either CRISPRi or the Cre-loxP system, with cell specificity conferred byDmp1regulatory elements in both cases. We demonstrate that CRISPRi is effective for cell type-specific LOF and that it provides improved cell type-specificity compared to the Cre-loxP system.© 2023 The Author(s)."
"37573356","The APC/C E3 ligase subunit ANAPC11 mediates FOXO3 protein degradation to promote cell proliferation and lymph node metastasis in urothelial bladder cancer.","Cell Death Dis","Urothelial bladder cancer (UBC) is one of the most prevalent malignancies worldwide, with striking tumor heterogeneity. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms that can be exploited for the treatment of aggressive UBC is a particularly relevant goal. Protein ubiquitination is a critical post-translational modification (PTM) that mediates the degradation of target protein via the proteasome. However, the roles of aberrant protein ubiquitination in UBC development and the underlying mechanisms by which it drives tumor progression remain unclear. In this study, taking advantage of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) 9 technology, we identified the ubiquitin E3 ligase ANAPC11, a critical subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), as a potential oncogenic molecule in UBC cells. Our clinical analysis showed that elevated expression of ANAPC11 was significantly correlated with high T stage, positive lymph node (LN) metastasis, and poor outcomes in UBC patients. By employing a series of in vitro experiments, we demonstrated that ANAPC11 enhanced the proliferation and invasiveness of UBC cells, while knockout of ANAPC11 inhibited the growth and LN metastasis of UBC cells in vivo. By conducting immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry, we confirmed that ANAPC11 increased the ubiquitination level of the Forkhead transcription factor FOXO3. The resulting decrease in FOXO3 protein stability led to the downregulation of the cell cycle regulator p21 and decreased expression of GULP1, a downstream effector of androgen receptor signaling. Taken together, these findings indicated that ANAPC11 plays an oncogenic role in UBC by modulating FOXO3 protein degradation. The ANAPC11-FOXO3 regulatory axis might serve as a novel therapeutic target for UBC.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37612510",NA,NA,"The prevalence of highly repetitive sequences within the human Y chromosome has prevented its complete assembly to date1and led to its systematic omission from genomic analyses. Here we present de novo assemblies of 43 Y chromosomes spanning 182,900 years of human evolution and report considerable diversity in size and structure. Half of the male-specific euchromatic region is subject to large inversions with a greater than twofold higher recurrence rate compared with all other chromosomes2. Ampliconic sequences associated with these inversions show differing mutation rates that are sequence context dependent, and some ampliconic genes exhibit evidence for concerted evolution with the acquisition and purging of lineage-specific pseudogenes. The largest heterochromatic region in the human genome, Yq12, is composed of alternating repeat arrays that show extensive variation in the number, size and distribution, but retain a 1:1 copy-number ratio. Finally, our data suggest that the boundary between the recombining pseudoautosomal region 1 and the non-recombining portions of the X and Y chromosomes lies 500 kb away from the currently established1boundary. The availability of fully sequence-resolved Y chromosomes from multiple individuals provides a unique opportunity for identifying new associations of traits with specific Y-chromosomal variants and garnering insights into the evolution and function of complex regions of the human genome.© 2023.

"37580559","UniAligner: a parameter-free framework for fast sequence alignment.","Nat Methods","Even though the recent advances in 'complete genomics' revealed the previously inaccessible genomic regions, analysis of variations in centromeres and other extra-long tandem repeats (ETRs) faces an algorithmic challenge since there are currently no tools for accurate sequence comparison of ETRs. Counterintuitively, the classical alignment approaches, such as the Smith-Waterman algorithm, fail to construct biologically adequate alignments of ETRs. We present UniAligner-the parameter-free sequence alignment algorithm with sequence-dependent alignment scoring that automatically changes for any pair of compared sequences. UniAligner prioritizes matches of rare substrings that are more likely to be relevant to the evolutionary relationship between two sequences. We apply UniAligner to estimate the mutation rates in human centromeres, and quantify the extremely high rate of large duplications and deletions in centromeres. This high rate suggests that centromeres may represent some of the most rapidly evolving regions of the human genome with respect to their structural organization.© 2023.

Their biological functions in innate immunity, as well as their structure and activity relationships, along with their mechanisms of action and therapeutic potential, have been of great interest in recent years. To highlight the key research into the role of defensins in human and animal health, we first describe their research history, structural features, evolution, and antimicrobial mechanisms. Next, we cover the role of defensins in immune homeostasis, chemotaxis, mucosal barrier function, gut microbiota regulation, intestinal development and regulation of cell death. Further, we discuss their clinical relevance and therapeutic potential in various diseases, including infectious disease, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes and obesity, chronic inflammatory lung disease, periodontitis and cancer. Finally, we summarize the current knowledge regarding the nutrient-dependent regulation of defensins, including fatty acids, amino acids, microelements, plant extracts, and probiotics, while considering the clinical application of such regulation. Together, the review summarizes the various biological functions, mechanism of actions and potential clinical significance of defensins, along with the challenges in developing defensins-based therapy, thus providing crucial insights into their biology and potential clinical utility.© 2023.

"37546784","Efficient Formation of Single-copy Human Artificial Chromosomes.","bioRxiv","Large DNA assembly methodologies underlie milestone achievements in synthetic prokaryotic and budding yeast chromosomes. While budding yeast control chromosome inheritance through ∼125 bp DNA sequence-defined centromeres, mammals and many other eukaryotes use large, epigenetic centromeres. Harnessing centromere epigenetics permits human artificial chromosome (HAC) formation but is not sufficient to avoid rampant multimerization of the initial DNA molecule upon introduction to cells. Here, we describe an approach that efficiently forms single-copy HACs. It employs a ∼750 kb construct that is sufficiently large to house the distinct chromatin types present at the inner and outer centromere, obviating the need to multimerize. Delivery to mammalian cells is streamlined by employing yeast spheroplast fusion. These developments permit faithful chromosome engineering in the context of metazoan cells.A quarter century after the first human artificial chromosomes, a solution to their uncontrolled multimerization is achieved."
"37541261","Centromere Plasticity With Evolutionary Conservation and Divergence Uncovered by Wheat 10+ Genomes.","Mol Biol Evol","Centromeres (CEN) are the chromosomal regions that play a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability. The underlying highly repetitive DNA sequences can evolve quickly in most eukaryotes, and promote karyotype evolution. Despite their variability, it is not fully understood how these widely variable sequences ensure the homeostasis of centromere function. In this study, we investigated the genetics and epigenetics of CEN in a population of wheat lines from global breeding programs. We captured a high degree of sequences, positioning, and epigenetic variations in the large and complex wheat CEN. We found that most CENH3-associated repeats are Cereba element of retrotransposons and exhibit phylogenetic homogenization across different wheat lines, but the less-associated repeat sequences diverge on their own way in each wheat line, implying specific mechanisms for selecting certain repeat types as functional core CEN. Furthermore, we observed that CENH3 nucleosome structures display looser wrapping of DNA termini on complex centromeric repeats, including the repositioned CEN. We also found that strict CENH3 nucleosome positioning and intrinsic DNA features play a role in determining centromere identity among different lines. Specific non-B form DNAs were substantially associated with CENH3 nucleosomes for the repositioned centromeres. These findings suggest that multiple mechanisms were involved in the adaptation of CENH3 nucleosomes that can stabilize CEN. Ultimately, we proposed a remarkable epigenetic plasticity of centromere chromatin within the diverse genomic context, and the high robustness is crucial for maintaining centromere function and genome stability in wheat 10+ lines as a result of past breeding selections.© The Author(s) 2023.

"37660182",NA,NA,"Tumour progression and therapy tolerance are highly regulated and complex processes largely dependent on the plasticity of cancer cells and their capacity to respond to stress. The higher plasticity of cancer cells highlights the need for identifying targetable molecular pathways that challenge cancer cell survival. Here, we show that N7-guanosine methylation (m7G) of tRNAs, mediated by METTL1, regulates survival to stress conditions in cancer cells. Mechanistically, we find that m7G in tRNAs protects them from stress-induced cleavage and processing into 5' tRNA fragments. Our analyses reveal that the loss of tRNA m7G methylation activates stress response pathways, sensitising cancer cells to stress. Furthermore, we find that the loss of METTL1 reduces tumour growth and increases cytotoxic stress in vivo. Our study uncovers the role of m7G methylation of tRNAs in stress responses and highlights the potential of targeting METTL1 to sensitise cancer cells to chemotherapy.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37644165","Aged hematopoietic stem cells entrap regulatory T cells to create a prosurvival microenvironment.","Cell Mol Immunol","Although DNA mutation drives stem cell aging, how mutation-accumulated stem cells obtain clonal advantage during aging remains poorly understood. Here, using a mouse model of irradiation-induced premature aging and middle-aged mice, we show that DNA mutation accumulation in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) during aging upregulates their surface expression of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII). MHCII upregulation increases the chance for recognition by bone marrow (BM)-resident regulatory T cells (Tregs), resulting in their clonal expansion and accumulation in the HSC niche. On the basis of the establishment of connexin 43 (Cx43)-mediated gap junctions, BM Tregs transfer cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) to aged HSCs to diminish apoptotic priming and promote their survival via activation of protein kinase A (PKA) signaling. Importantly, targeting the HSC-Treg interaction or depleting Tregs effectively prevents the premature/physiological aging of HSCs. These findings show that aged HSCs use an active self-protective mechanism by entrapping local Tregs to construct a prosurvival niche and obtain a clonal advantage.© 2023.

"37626896",NA,NA,"Since Joseph Altman published his pioneering work demonstrating neurogenesis in the hippocampus of adult rats, the number of publications in this field increased exponentially. Today, we know that the adult hippocampus harbors a pool of adult neural stem cells (NSCs) that are the source of life-long neurogenesis and plasticity. The functions of these NSCs are regulated by extrinsic cues arising from neighboring cells and the systemic environment. However, this tight regulation is subject to imbalance with age, resulting in a decline in adult NSCs and neurogenesis, which contributes to the progressive deterioration of hippocampus-related cognitive functions. Despite extensive investigation, the mechanisms underlying this age-related decline in neurogenesis are only incompletely understood, but appear to include an increase in NSC quiescence, changes in differentiation patterns, and NSC exhaustion. In this review, we summarize recent work that has improved our knowledge of hippocampal NSC aging, focusing on NSC-intrinsic mechanisms as well as cellular and molecular changes in the niche and systemic environment that might be involved in the age-related decline in NSC functions. Additionally, we identify future directions that may advance our understanding of NSC aging and the concomitant loss of hippocampal neurogenesis and plasticity."
"37621775","Lessons in aging from Myc knockout mouse models.","Front Cell Dev Biol","DespiteMYCbeing among the most intensively studied oncogenes, its role in normal development has not been determined asMyc-/-mice do not survival beyond mid-gestation.Myc± mice live longer than their wild-type counterparts and are slower to accumulate many age-related phenotypes. However,Mychaplo-insufficiency likely conceals other important phenotypes as many high-affinity Myc targets genes continue to be regulated normally. By delayingMycinactivation until after birth it has recently been possible to study the consequences of its near-complete total body loss and thus to infer its normal function. Against expectation, these""MycKO"" mice lived significantly longer than control wild-type mice but manifested a marked premature aging phenotype. This seemingly paradoxical behavior was potentially explained by a >3-fold lower lifetime incidence of cancer, normally the most common cause of death in mice and often Myc-driven.Mycloss accelerated the accumulation of numerous ""Aging Hallmarks"", including the loss of mitochondrial and ribosomal structural and functional integrity, the generation of reactive oxygen species, the acquisition of genotoxic damage, the detrimental rewiring of metabolism and the onset of senescence. In both mice and humans, normal aging in many tissues was accompaniued by the downregulation of Myc and the loss of Myc target gene regulation. Unlike most mouse models of premature aging, which are based on monogenic disorders of DNA damage recognition and repair, theMycKO mouse model directly impacts most Aging Hallmarks and may therefore more faithfully replicate the normal aging process of both mice and humans. It further establishes that the strong association between aging and cancer can be genetically separated and is maintained by a single gene.Copyright © 2023 Prochownik and Wang."

We characterized the immune profile and identified cellular and molecular pathways modified by tocilizumab in peripheral blood samples from patients enrolled in the COVACTA study, a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. We identified markers of inflammation, lymphopenia, myeloid dysregulation, and organ injury that predict disease severity and clinical outcomes. Proteomic analysis confirmed a pharmacodynamic effect for tocilizumab and identified novel pharmacodynamic biomarkers.

The international FCD classifications of 2011 and 2022 have identified several clinico-pathological subtypes, either occurring isolated, i.e., FCD ILAE Type 1 or 2, or in association with a principal cortical lesion, i.e., FCD Type 3. Here, we addressed the DNA methylation signature of a previously described new subtype of FCD 3D occurring in the occipital lobe of very young children and microscopically defined by neuronal cell loss in cortical layer 4. We studied the DNA methylation profile using 850 K BeadChip arrays in a retrospective cohort of 104 patients with FCD 1 A, 2 A, 2B, 3D, TLE without FCD, and 16 postmortem specimens without neurological disorders as controls, operated in China or Germany. DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks with microscopically confirmed lesions, and DNA methylation profiles were bioinformatically analyzed with a recently developed deep learning algorithm. Our results revealed a distinct position of FCD 3D in the DNA methylation map of common FCD subtypes, also different from non-FCD epilepsy surgery controls or non-epileptic postmortem controls. Within the FCD 3D cohort, the DNA methylation signature separated three histopathology subtypes, i.e., glial scarring around porencephalic cysts, loss of layer 4, and Rasmussen encephalitis. Differential methylation in FCD 3D with loss of layer 4 mapped explicitly to biological pathways related to neurodegeneration, biogenesis of the extracellular matrix (ECM) components, axon guidance, and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Our data suggest that DNA methylation signatures in cortical malformations are not only of diagnostic value but also phenotypically relevant, providing the molecular underpinnings of structural and histopathological features associated with epilepsy. Further studies will be necessary to confirm these results and clarify their functional relevance and epileptogenic potential in these difficult-to-treat children.© 2023.

"37612705","Emergence and influence of sequence bias in evolutionarily malleable, mammalian tandem arrays.","BMC Biol","The radiation of mammals at the extinction of the dinosaurs produced a plethora of new forms-as diverse as bats, dolphins, and elephants-in only 10-20 million years. Behind the scenes, adaptation to new niches is accompanied by extensive innovation in large families of genes that allow animals to contact the environment, including chemosensors, xenobiotic enzymes, and immune and barrier proteins. Genes in these ""outward-looking"" families are allelically diverse among humans and exhibit tissue-specific and sometimes stochastic expression.Here, we show that these tandem arrays of outward-looking genes occupy AT-biased isochores and comprise the ""tissue-specific"" gene class that lack CpG islands in their promoters. Models of mammalian genome evolution have not incorporated the sharply different functions and transcriptional patterns of genes in AT- versus GC-biased regions. To examine the relationship between gene family expansion, sequence content, and allelic diversity, we use population genetic data and comparative analysis. First, we find that AT bias can emerge during evolutionary expansion of gene families in cis. Second, human genes in AT-biased isochores or with GC-poor promoters experience relatively low rates of de novo point mutation today but are enriched for non-synonymous variants. Finally, we find that isochores containing gene clusters exhibit low rates of recombination.Our analyses suggest that tolerance of non-synonymous variation and low recombination are two forces that have produced the depletion of GC bases in outward-facing gene arrays. In turn, high AT content exerts a profound effect on their chromatin organization and transcriptional regulation.© 2023. BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature."

Because totipotency is not completely understood, we carried out a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen in mouse ESCs, searching for mutants that reactivate the expression of Dazl, a gene expressed in 2CLCs. Here we report the identification of four mutants that reactivate Dazl and a broader 2-cell-like signature: the E3 ubiquitin ligase adaptor SPOP, the Zinc-Finger transcription factor ZBTB14, MCM3AP, a component of the RNA processing complex TREX-2, and the lysine demethylase KDM5C. All four factors function upstream of DPPA2 and DUX, but not via p53. In addition, SPOP binds DPPA2, and KDM5C interacts with ncPRC1.6 and inhibits 2CLC gene expression in a catalytic-independent manner.

"37466164",NA,NA,"In recent years, quantitative mass spectrometry-based interaction proteomics technology has proven very useful in identifying specific DNA-protein interactions using single pull-downs from crude lysates. Here, we applied a SILAC/TMT-based higher-order multiplexing approach to develop an interaction proteomics workflow called Protein-nucleic acid Affinity and Specificity quantification by MAss spectrometry in Nuclear extracts or PASMAN. In PASMAN, DNA pull-downs using a concentration range of specific and control DNA baits are performed in SILAC-labeled nuclear extracts. MS1-based quantification to determine specific DNA-protein interactions is then combined with sequential TMT-based quantification of fragmented SILAC peptides, allowing the generation of Hill-like curves and determination of apparent binding affinities. We benchmarked PASMAN using the SP/KLF motif and further applied it to gain insights into two CGCG-containing consensus DNA motifs. These motifs are recognized by two BEN domain-containing proteins, BANP and BEND3, which we find to interact with these motifs with distinct affinities. Finally, we profiled the BEND3 proximal proteome, revealing the NuRD complex as the major BEND3 proximal protein complex in vivo. In summary, PASMAN represents, to our knowledge, the first higher-order multiplexing-based interaction proteomics method that can be used to decipher specific DNA-protein interactions and their apparent affinities in various biological and pathological contexts."

Here, a single-cell transcriptome dataset of chondrocytes is used to explore the synergistic and communicative patterns of different chondrocyte subtypes. We collected 1600 chondrocytes from 10 patients with osteoarthritis and analyzed the active communication patterns for the first time based on network analysis and pattern recognition at the single-cell level. Manifold learning and quantitative contrasts were performed to analyze conserved and specific communication pathways. We found that ProCs (Proliferative chondrocytes), ECs (Effector chondrocytes), preHTCs (Prehypertrophic chondrocytes), HTCs (Hypertrophic chondrocytes), and FCs (Fibrocartilage chondrocytes) are more active in incoming and outgoing signaling patterns, which is consistent with studies on their close functional cooperation. Among them, preHTCs play multiple roles in chondrocyte communication, and ProCs and preHTCs have many overlapping pathways. These two subtypes are the most active among all chondrocyte subtypes. Interestingly, ECs and FCs are a pair of ""mutually exclusive"" subtypes, of which ECs are predominant in incoming patterns and FCs in outgoing patterns. The active signaling pathways of ECs and FCs largely do not overlap. COLLAGEN and LAMININ are the main pivotal pathways, which means they are very important in the repair and expansion of joint homeostasis. Notably, only preHTCs assume multiple roles (including sender, receiver, mediator, and influencer) and are involved in multiple communication pathways. We have examined their communication patterns from the perspective of cellular interactions, revealed the relationships among different chondrocyte subtypes, and, in particular, identified a number of active subtypes and pathways that are important for targeted therapy in the osteoarthritic microenvironment. Our findings provide a new research paradigm and new insights into understanding chondrocyte activity patterns in the osteoarthritic microenvironment.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."

Although bulk RNA sequencing and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have provided insights into cell types and heterogeneity in the respiratory system, the relevant specific spatial localization and cellular interactions have not been clearly elucidated. Spatial transcriptomics (ST) has filled this gap and has been widely used in respiratory studies. This review focuses on the latest iterative technology of ST in recent years, summarizing how ST can be applied to the physiological and pathological processes of the respiratory system, with emphasis on the lungs. Finally, the current challenges and potential development directions are proposed, including high-throughput full-length transcriptome, integration of multi-omics, temporal and spatial omics, bioinformatics analysis, etc. These viewpoints are expected to advance the study of systematic mechanisms, including respiratory studies.© 2023.

"37577623","Model-based compound hypothesis testing for snATAC-seq data with PACS.","bioRxiv","Single nucleus ATAC-seq (snATAC-seq) experimental designs have become increasingly complex with multiple factors that might affect chromatin accessibility, including cell type, tissue of origin, sample location, batch, etc., whose compound effects are difficult to test by existing methods. In addition, current snATAC-seq data present statistical difficulties due to their sparsity and variations in individual sequence capture. To address these problems, we present a zero-adjusted statistical model, PACS, that can allow complex hypothesis testing of factors that affect accessibility while accounting for sparse and incomplete data. For differential accessibility analysis, PACS controls the false positive rate and achieves on average a 17% to 122% higher power than existing tools. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PACS through several analysis tasks including supervised cell type annotation, compound hypothesis testing, batch effect correction, and spatiotemporal modeling. We apply PACS to several datasets from a variety of tissues and show its ability to reveal previously undiscovered insights in snATAC-seq data."

To address this, herein, we developed scNanoHi-C, which applies Nanopore long-read sequencing to explore genome-wide proximal high-order chromatin contacts within individual cells. We show that scNanoHi-C can reliably and effectively profile 3D chromatin structures and distinguish structure subtypes among individual cells. This method could also be used to detect genomic variations, including copy-number variations and structural variations, as well as to scaffold the de novo assembly of single-cell genomes. Notably, our results suggest that extensive high-order chromatin structures exist in active chromatin regions across the genome, and multiway interactions between enhancers and their target promoters were systematically identified within individual cells. Altogether, scNanoHi-C offers new opportunities to investigate high-order 3D genome structures at the single-cell level.© 2023.

"37574486","Analysis of Copy Number Variation of DNA Repair/Damage Response Genes in Tumor Tissues.","Methods Mol Biol","Cells experience increased genome instability through the course of disease development including cancer initiation and progression. Point mutations, insertion/deletions, translocations, and amplifications of both coding and noncoding regions all contribute to cancer phenotypes. Copy number variation (CNV), i.e., changes of the number of copies of nuclear DNA, occurs in the genome of even normal somatic cells. Studies to understand the effects of CNV on tumor development, especially aspects concerning tumor aggressiveness and the influence on outcomes of therapeutic modalities, have been reignited by the breakthrough technologies of the molecular genomics. This section discusses the significance of analyzing CNVs that cause simultaneous increase/decrease of clusters of genes, using the expression profile of XRCC1 with its neighbor genes LIG1, PNKP, and POLD1 as an example. Methods for CNV assay at the individual gene level on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues using the NanoString nCounter technology will then be described.© 2023.

Emerging evidence points to the importance of LLPS in human health and diseases. Nevertheless, despite recent advancements, our knowledge of the molecular relationship between LLPS and diseases is frequently incomplete. In this review, we outline our current understanding about how aberrant LLPS affects developmental disorders, tandem repeat disorders, cancers and viral infection. We also examine disease mechanisms driven by aberrant condensates, and highlight potential treatment approaches. This study seeks to expand our understanding of LLPS by providing a valuable new paradigm for understanding phase separation and human disorders, as well as to further translate our current knowledge regarding LLPS into therapeutic discoveries."
"37464880","Sequence variations of phase-separating proteins and resources for studying biomolecular condensates.","Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai)","Phase separation (PS) is an important mechanism underlying the formation of biomolecular condensates. Physiological condensates are associated with numerous biological processes, such as transcription, immunity, signaling, and synaptic transmission. Changes in particular amino acids or segments can disturb the protein's phase behavior and interactions with other biomolecules in condensates. It is thus presumed that variations in the phase-separating-prone domains can significantly impact the properties and functions of condensates. The dysfunction of condensates contributes to a number of pathological processes. Pharmacological perturbation of these condensates is proposed as a promising way to restore physiological states. In this review, we characterize the variations observed in PS proteins that lead to aberrant biomolecular compartmentalization. We also showcase recent advancements in bioinformatics of membraneless organelles (MLOs), focusing on available databases useful for screening PS proteins and describing endogenous condensates, guiding researchers to seek the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of biomolecular condensates."
"37428142","Accelerating bioinformatics implementation in public health.","Microb Genom","We have adopted an open bioinformatics ecosystem to address the challenges of bioinformatics implementation in public health laboratories (PHLs). Bioinformatics implementation for public health requires practitioners to undertake standardized bioinformatic analyses and generate reproducible, validated and auditable results. It is essential that data storage and analysis are scalable, portable and secure, and that implementation of bioinformatics fits within the operational constraints of the laboratory. We address these requirements using Terra, a web-based data analysis platform with a graphical user interface connecting users to bioinformatics analyses without the use of code. We have developed bioinformatics workflows for use with Terra that specifically meet the needs of public health practitioners. These Theiagen workflows perform genome assembly, quality control, and characterization, as well as construction of phylogeny for insights into genomic epidemiology. Additonally, these workflows use open-source containerized software and the WDL workflow language to ensure standardization and interoperability with other bioinformatics solutions, whilst being adaptable by the user. They are all open source and publicly available in Dockstore with the version-controlled code available in public GitHub repositories. They have been written to generate outputs in standardized file formats to allow for further downstream analysis and visualization with separate genomic epidemiology software. Testament to this solution meeting the requirements for bioinformatic implementation in public health, Theiagen workflows have collectively been used for over 5 million sample analyses in the last 2 years by over 90 public health laboratories in at least 40 different countries. Continued adoption of technological innovations and development of further workflows will ensure that this ecosystem continues to benefit PHLs."
"37639434","Prediction of DNA Methylation based on Multi-dimensional feature encoding and double convolutional fully connected convolutional neural network.","PLoS Comput Biol","DNA methylation takes on critical significance to the regulation of gene expression by affecting the stability of DNA and changing the structure of chromosomes. DNA methylation modification sites should be identified, which lays a solid basis for gaining more insights into their biological functions. Existing machine learning-based methods of predicting DNA methylation have not fully exploited the hidden multidimensional information in DNA gene sequences, such that the prediction accuracy of models is significantly limited. Besides, most models have been built in terms of a single methylation type. To address the above-mentioned issues, a deep learning-based method was proposed in this study for DNA methylation site prediction, termed the MEDCNN model. The MEDCNN model is capable of extracting feature information from gene sequences in three dimensions (i.e., positional information, biological information, and chemical information). Moreover, the proposed method employs a convolutional neural network model with double convolutional layers and double fully connected layers while iteratively updating the gradient descent algorithm using the cross-entropy loss function to increase the prediction accuracy of the model. Besides, the MEDCNN model can predict different types of DNA methylation sites. As indicated by the experimental results,the deep learning method based on coding from multiple dimensions outperformed single coding methods, and the MEDCNN model was highly applicable and outperformed existing models in predicting DNA methylation between different species. As revealed by the above-described findings, the MEDCNN model can be effective in predicting DNA methylation sites.Copyright: © 2023 Hu et al.

Here, we developed a machine learning approach to map iTME modifiers within loci from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for breast cancer (BrCa) incidence. A random forest model was trained on a positive set of immune-oncology (I-O) targets, and then used to assign I-O target probability scores to 1,362 candidate genes in linkage disequilibrium with 155 BrCa GWAS loci. Cluster analysis of the most probable candidates revealed two subfamilies of genes related to effector functions and adaptive immune responses, suggesting that iTME modifiers impact multiple aspects of anticancer immunity. Two of the top ranking BrCa candidates,LSP1andTLR1, were orthogonally validated as iTME modifiers using BrCa patient biopsies and comparative mapping studies, respectively. Collectively, these data demonstrate a robust and flexible framework for functionally fine-mapping GWAS risk loci to identify translatable therapeutic targets.© 2023 The Author(s)."
"37655340","Mendelian randomization supports causality between gut microbiota and chronic hepatitis B.","Front Microbiol","Observational studies have provided evidence of a close association between gut microbiota and the progression of chronic hepatitis B (CHB). However, establishing a causal relationship between gut microbiota and CHB remains a subject of investigation.Genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data of gut microbiota came from the MiBioGen consortium, while the GWAS summary data of CHB came from the Medical Research Council Integrative Epidemiology Unit (IEU) Open GWAS project. Based on the maximum likelihood (ML), Mendelian randomization (MR)-Egger regression, inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier (MR-PRESSO), and weighted-mode and weighted-median methods, we conducted a bidirectional, two-sample, MR analysis to explore the causal relationship between the gut microbiota and CHB. Additionally, we evaluated the genetic associations between individual gut microbes and CHB using the Linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) program.According to the IVW method estimates, genetically predicted class Alphaproteobacteria (odds ratio [OR] = 0.57; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.34-0.96; false discovery rate [FDR] = 0.046), genusFamily XIII AD3011group (OR = 0.60; 95% CI, 0.39-0.91; FDR = 0.026), genusPrevotella 7(OR = 0.73; 95% CI, 0.56-0.94; FDR = 0.022) exhibited a protective effect against CHB. On the other hand, family Family XIII (OR = 1.79; 95% CI, 1.03-3.12; FDR = 0.061), genusEggerthellagroup (OR = 1.34; 95% CI, 1.04-1.74; FDR = 0.043), genusEubacterium ventriosumgroup (OR = 1.59; 95% CI, 1.01-2.51; FDR = 0.056), genusHoldemania(OR = 1.35; 95% CI, 1.00-1.82; FDR = 0.049), and genusRuminococcus gauvreauiigroup (OR = 1.69; 95% CI, 1.10-2.61; FDR = 0.076) were associated with an increased risk of CHB. The results from LDSC also indicated a significant genetic correlation between most of the aforementioned gut microbiota and CHB. Our reverse MR analysis demonstrated no causal relationship between genetically predicted CHB and gut microbiota, and we observed no significant horizontal pleiotropy or heterogeneity of instrumental variables (IVs).In this study, we identified three types of gut microbiota with a protective effect on CHB and five types with an adverse impact on CHB. We postulate that this information will facilitate the clinical prevention and treatment of CHB through fecal microbiota transplantation.Copyright © 2023 Zhang, Zhou, Zhang, Mao and Zhang."
"37612393",NA,NA,"The substantial investments in human genetics and genomics made over the past three decades were anticipated to result in many innovative therapies. Here we investigate the extent to which these expectations have been met, excluding cancer treatments. In our search, we identified 40 germline genetic observations that led directly to new targets and subsequently to novel approved therapies for 36 rare and 4 common conditions. The median time between genetic target discovery and drug approval was 25 years. Most of the genetically driven therapies for rare diseases compensate for disease-causing loss-of-function mutations. The therapies approved for common conditions are all inhibitors designed to pharmacologically mimic the natural, disease-protective effects of rare loss-of-function variants. Large biobank-based genetic studies have the power to identify and validate a large number of new drug targets. Genetics can also assist in the clinical development phase of drugs-for example, by selecting individuals who are most likely to respond to investigational therapies. This approach to drug development requires investments into large, diverse cohorts of deeply phenotyped individuals with appropriate consent for genetically assisted trials. A robust framework that facilitates responsible, sustainable benefit sharing will be required to capture the full potential of human genetics and genomics and bring effective and safe innovative therapies to patients quickly.© 2023.

Five novel loci for ischemic stroke (LAMC1,CALCRL,PLSCR1,CDKN1A, andSWAP70) were identified after replication in four additional datasets. One previously reported locus showed significant ancestry heterogeneity (ABO), and one showed significant sex heterogeneity (ALDH2). TheALDH2association was male specific (males p = 1.67e-24, females p = 0.126) and was additionally observed only in the East Asian ancestry (male) samples.

However, the functions and interactive mechanism of LINC02015 remain unknown. This study aimed to explore the role of LINC02015 in the cell proliferation and apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) to explain the pathogenesis of aortic diseases. Ascending aorta samples and angiotensin-II (AT-II) treated primary human aortic VSMCs (HAVSMCs) were used to evaluate the LINC02015 expression. RNA sequencing, chromatin isolation by RNA purification sequencing, RNA pull-down, and mass spectrometry (MS) were applied to explore the potential interacting mechanisms. LINC02015 expression was found elevated in aortic dissection and AT-II-treated HAVSMCs. Cell proliferation and cell cycle were activated in HAVSMCs with LINC02015 knockdown. The cyclins family and caspase family were found to participate in regulating the cell cycle and apoptosis via the NF-κB signaling pathway. RXRA was discovered as a possible hub gene for LINC02015 transcriptional regulating networks. Besides, the protein interaction network of LINC02015 was revealed with candidate regulating molecules. It was concluded that the knockdown of LINC02015 could promote cell proliferation and inhibit the apoptosis of HAVSMCs through an RXRA-related transcriptional regulation network, which could provide a potential therapeutic target for aortic diseases.© 2023.

Recent studies have highlighted the potential role of infection in the pathogenesis of IPF and a prior association of theHLA-DQB1gene with idiopathic fibrotic interstitial pneumonia (including IPF) has been reported. Due to the important role that the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) region plays in the immune response, here we evaluated if HLA genetic variation was associated specifically with IPF risk.We performed a meta-analysis of associations of the HLA region with IPF risk in individuals of European ancestry from seven independent case-control studies of IPF (comprising a total of 5,159 cases and 27,459 controls, including the prior study of fibrotic interstitial pneumonia). Single nucleotide polymorphisms, classical HLA alleles and amino acids were analysed and signals meeting a region-wide association thresholdp<4.5×10-4and a posterior probability of replication >90% were considered significant. We sought to replicate the previously reportedHLA-DQB1association in the subset of studies independent of the original report.The meta-analysis of all seven studies identified four significant independent single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with IPF risk. However, none met the posterior probability for replication criterion. TheHLA-DQB1association was not replicated in the independent IPF studies.Variation in the HLA region was not consistently associated with risk in studies of IPF. However, this does not preclude the possibility that other genomic regions linked to the immune response may be involved in the aetiology of IPF."

The significant features of the MRB model were selected from those obtained from gray-scale and three-dimensional wavelet-filtered images, BN and inverted BN (iBN) maps, and clinical variables (age and gender). The primary sites were predicted as either lung cancer or other cancers using MRB models, which were built using seven machine learning methods with significant features chosen by three feature selection methods followed by a combination strategy. Our study dealt with a dataset with relatively smaller brain metastases, which included effective diameters greater than 2 mm, with metastases ranging from 2 to 9 mm accounting for 17% of the dataset. The MRB models were trained by T1-weighted contrast-enhanced images of 494 metastases chosen from 247 patients and applied to 115 metastases from 62 test patients. The most feasible model attained an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.763 for the test patients when using a signature including features of BN and iBN maps, gray-scale and wavelet-filtered images, and clinical variables. The AUCs of the model were 0.744 for non-small cell lung cancer and 0.861 for small cell lung cancer.

We then obtained cell cluster-associated gene modules by weighted co-expression network analysis and identified tumorigenesis-associated cell clusters and gene modules in PAAD by trajectory analysis. Tumor-associated genes of PAAD were intersected with cell cluster marker genes and within the signature module to obtain genes associated with PAAD occurrence to construct a prognostic risk assessment tool by the COX model. The performance of the model was assessed by the Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curve and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The score of endocrine pathways was assessed by ssGSEA analysis.The PAAD single-cell dataset GSE165399 was filtered and downscaled, and finally, 17 cell subgroups were filtered and 17 cell clusters were labeled. WGCNA analysis revealed that the brown module was most associated with tumorigenesis. Among them, the brown module was significantly associated with C11 and C14 cell clusters. C11 and C14 cell clusters belonged to fibroblast and circulating fetal cells, respectively, and trajectory analysis showed low heterogeneity for fibroblast and extremely high heterogeneity for circulating fetal cells. Next, through differential analysis, we found that genes within the C11 cluster were highly associated with tumorigenesis. Finally, we constructed the RiskScore system, and K-M curves and ROC curves revealed that RiskScore possessed objective clinical prognostic potential and demonstrated consistent robustness in multiple datasets. The low-risk group presented a higher endocrine metabolism and lower immune infiltrate state.We identified prognostic models consisting of APOL1, BHLHE40, CLMP, GNG12, LOX, LY6E, MYL12B, RND3, SOX4, and RiskScore showed promising clinical value.

First, the filtered data were randomized into the test and verification groups. Second, in the test group, specific variables were screened using logistic regression analysis, Lasso regression analysis, support vector machine, and random forest. Specific variables obtained using the four methods were intersected, and a dynamic model was constructed. ROC and calibration curves were constructed to assess model performance. Finally, internal model performance was verified in the verification group using ROC and calibration curves.The data from 4019 patients were collected. In total, 1327 eligible cases were selected. By combining logistic regression analysis with three machine learning algorithms, this study identified four predictors associated with SSI, namely Modic changes, sebum thickness, hemoglobin, and glucose. Using this information, a prediction model was developed and visually represented. Then, we constructed ROC and calibration curves using the test group; the area under the ROC curve was 0.988. Further, calibration curve analysis revealed favorable consistency of nomogram-predicted values compared with real measurements. The C-index of our model was 0.986 (95% CI 0.981-0.994).

The aim of this study is to demonstrate the reliability and efficiency of this AI-driven approach.CAPRI-3 is an observational retrospective multicenter cohort registry on metastatic prostate cancer. We tested the patient-identification algorithm and automated data extraction through manual validation of the same patients in two pilots in 2019 and 2022.Pilot one identified 2030 patients and pilot two 9464 patients. The negative predictive value of the algorithm was maximized to prevent false exclusions and reached 94.8%. The completeness and accuracy of the automated data extraction were 92.3% or higher, except for date fields and inaccessible data (images/pdf) (10-88.9%). Additional manual quality control took over 3 h less time per patient than the original fully manual CAPRI registry (105 vs. 300 min).The CAPRI-3 patient-identification algorithm is a sound replacement for excluding ineligible candidates. The AI-driven data extraction is largely accurate and complete, but manual quality control is needed for less reliable and inaccessible data. Overall, the AI-driven approach of the CAPRI-3 registry is reliable and timesaving."

Therefore, context is necessary to understand the meaning of the word model. For instance, ""model railways"" refer to replicas of railways and trains at a smaller scale and a ""model student"" refers to an exemplary individual. In some cases, a specific context, like cancer research, may not be sufficient to provide one specific meaning for model. Even if the context is narrowed, specifically, to research related to the tumour microenvironment, ""model"" can be understood in a wide variety of ways, from an animal model to a mathematical expression. This paper presents a review of different ""models"" of the tumour microenvironment, as grouped by different definitions of the word into four categories: model organisms, in vitro models, mathematical models and computational models. Then, the frequencies of different meanings of the word ""model"" related to the tumour microenvironment are measured from numbers of entries in the MEDLINE database of the United States National Library of Medicine at the National Institutes of Health. The frequencies of the main components of the microenvironment and the organ-related cancers modelled are also assessed quantitatively with specific keywords. Whilst animal models, particularly xenografts and mouse models, are the most commonly used ""models"", the number of these entries has been slowly decreasing.

Our multi-omics investigation discovered a significant concordance for innate immunological and inflammatory responses following P. aeruginosa infection between hosts and alveolar macrophages. Furthermore, we discovered that multi-omics changes in pioneer factors Stat1 and Stat3 play a crucial role in the immunological regulation of P. aeruginosa infection and that their downstream molecules (e.g., Fas) may be implicated in both immunosuppressive and inflammation-promoting processes. Taken together, these findings indicate that transcription factors and their downstream signaling molecules play a critical role in the mobilization and rebalancing of the host immune response against P. aeruginosa infection and may serve as potential targets for bacterial infections and inflammatory diseases, providing insights and resources for omics analyses.Copyright: © 2023 Yang et al.

"37580546","Associations of Urban Built Environment with Cardiovascular Risks and Mortality: a Systematic Review.","J Urban Health","With rapid urbanization, built environment has emerged as a set of modifiable factors of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risks. We conducted a systematic review to synthesize evidence on the associations of attributes of urban built environment (e.g. residential density, land use mix, greenness and walkability) with cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. hypertension and arterial stiffness) and major CVD events including mortality. A total of 63 studies, including 31 of cross-sectional design and 32 of longitudinal design conducted across 21 geographical locations and published between 2012 and 2023 were extracted for review. Overall, we report moderately consistent evidence of protective associations of greenness with cardiovascular risks and major CVD events (cross-sectional studies: 12 of 15 on hypertension/blood pressure (BP) and 2 of 3 on arterial stiffness; and longitudinal studies: 6 of 8 on hypertension/BP, 7 of 8 on CVD mortality, 3 of 3 on ischemic heart disease mortality and 5 of 8 studies on stroke hospitalization or mortality reporting significant inverse associations). Consistently, walkability was associated with lower risks of hypertension, arterial stiffness and major CVD events (cross-sectional studies: 11 of 12 on hypertension/BP and 1 of 1 on arterial stiffness; and longitudinal studies: 3 of 6 on hypertension/BP and 1 of 2 studies on CVD events being protective). Sixty-seven percent of the studies were rated as ""probably high"" risk of confounding bias because of inability to adjust for underlying comorbidities/family history of diseases in their statistical models. Forty-six percent and 14% of the studies were rated as ""probably high"" risk of bias for exposure and outcome measurements, respectively. Future studies with robust design will further help elucidate the linkages between urban built environment and cardiovascular health, thereby informing planning policies for creating healthy cities.© 2023.

"37631988","Host DNA Demethylation Induced by DNMT1 Inhibition Up-Regulates Antiviral OASL Protein during Influenza a Virus Infection.","Viruses","Influenza A virus (IAV) is a leading cause of human respiratory infections and poses a major public health concern. IAV replication can affect the expression of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), and the subsequent changes in DNA methylation regulate gene expression and may lead to abnormal gene transcription and translation, yet the underlying mechanisms of virus-induced epigenetic changes from DNA methylation and its role in virus-host interactions remain elusive. Here in this paper, we showed that DNMT1 expression could be suppressed following the inhibition of miR-142-5p or the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway during IAV infection, resulting in demethylation of the promotor region of the 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase-like (OASL) protein and promotion of its expression in A549 cells. OASL expression enhanced RIG-I-mediated interferon induction and then suppressed replication of IAV. Our study elucidated an innate immunity mechanism by which up-regulation of OASL contributes to host antiviral responses via epigenetic modifications in IAV infection, which could provide important insights into the understanding of viral pathogenesis and host antiviral defense."

However, while advances have been made in the molecular and computational methods to analyze the methylation status of a given sample of DNA, tools to profile and compare the methylomes of multiple individual plants or groups of plants at high resolution and low cost are lacking. Here, we describe a computational approach and R package (sounDMR) that leverages the benefits of long read nanopore sequencing to enable robust identification of differential methylation from complex experimental designs, as well as assess the variability within treatment groups and identify individual plants of interest. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by profiling a population of Arabidopsis thaliana exposed to a demethylating agent and identify genomic regions of high epigenetic variability between individuals. Given the low cost of nanopore sequencing devices and the ease of sample preparation, these results show that high resolution epigenetic profiling of plant populations can be made more broadly accessible in plant breeding and biotechnology.© 2023.

However, the structures and biological impacts of such abnormalities have seldomly been analyzed at the molecular level. Previously, we reported a Japanese female patient with severe developmental defects. The patient had an extra dicentric chromosome 21 (chr21) consisting of two partial chr21 copies fused together within their long arms along with two centromeres and many copy number changes. In this study, we performed whole-genome, transcriptional, and DNA methylation analyses, coupled with novel bioinformatic approaches, to reveal the complex structure of the extra chromosome and its transcriptional and epigenetic changes. Long-read sequencing accurately identified the structures of junctions related to the copy number changes in extra chr21 and suggested the mechanism of the structural changes. Our transcriptome analysis showed the overexpression of genes in extra chr21. Additionally, an allele-specific DNA methylation analysis of the long-read sequencing data suggested that the centromeric region of extra chr21 was hypermethylated, a property associated with the inactivation of one centromere in the extra chromosome. Our comprehensive analysis provides insights into the molecular mechanism underlying the generation of the extra chromosome and its pathogenic roles.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Here we investigate a locus that evolved through gene duplication and contains eight genes and 20 candidate regulatory elements, including one super-enhancer. Casein genes (Csn1s1, Csn2, Csn1s2a, Csn1s2b, Csn3) are expressed in mammary glands, induced 10,000-fold during pregnancy and account for 50% of mRNAs during lactation, Prr27 and Fdcsp are salivary-specific and Odam has dual specificity. We probed the function of 12 candidate regulatory elements, individually and in combination, in the mouse genome. The super-enhancer is essential for the expression of Csn3, Csn1s2b, Odam and Fdcsp but largely dispensable for Csn1s1, Csn2 and Csn1s2a. Csn3 activation also requires its own local enhancer. Synergism between local enhancers and cytokine-responsive promoter elements facilitates activation of Csn2 during pregnancy. Our work identifies the regulatory complexity of a multigene locus with an ancestral super-enhancer active in mammary and salivary tissue and local enhancers and promoter elements unique to mammary tissue.© 2023.

"37564646","RSV replication modifies the XBP1s binding complex on the IRF1 upstream enhancer to potentiate the mucosal anti-viral response.","Front Immunol","The unfolded protein response (UPR) has emerged as an important signaling pathway mediating anti-viral defenses to Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infection. Earlier we found that RSV replication predominantly activates the evolutionarily conserved Inositol Requiring Enzyme 1α (IRE1α)-X-Box Binding Protein 1 spliced (XBP1s) arm of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) producing inflammation, metabolic adaptation and cellular plasticity, yet the mechanisms how the UPR potentiates inflammation are not well understood.To understand this process better, we examined the genomic response integrating RNA-seq and Cleavage Under Targets and Release Using Nuclease (CUT&RUN) analyses. These data were integrated with an RNA-seq analysis conducted on RSV-infected small airway cells ± an IRE1α RNAse inhibitor.We identified RSV induced expression changes in ~3.2K genes; of these, 279 required IRE1α and were enriched in IL-10/cytokine signaling pathways. From this data set, we identify those genes directly under XBP1s control by CUT&RUN. Although XBP1s binds to ~4.2 K high-confidence genomic binding sites, surprisingly only a small subset of IL10/cytokine signaling genes are directly bound. We further apply CUT&RUN to find that RSV infection enhances XBP1s loading on 786 genomic sites enriched in AP1/Fra-1, RELA and SP1 binding sites. These control a subset of cytokine regulatory factor genes including IFN response factor 1 (IRF1), CSF2, NFKB1A and DUSP10. Focusing on the downstream role of IRF1, selective knockdown (KD) and overexpression experiments demonstrate IRF1 induction controls type I and -III interferon (IFN) and IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression, demonstrating that ISG are indirectly regulated by XBP1 through IRF1 transactivation. Examining the mechanism of IRF1 activation, we observe that XBP1s directly binds a 5' enhancer sequence whose XBP1s loading is increased by RSV. The functional requirement for the enhancer is demonstrated by targeting a dCas9-KRAB silencer, reducing IRF1 activation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation shows that XBP1 is required, but not sufficient, for RSV-induced recruitment of activated phospho-Ser2 Pol II to the enhancer.We conclude that XBP1s is a direct activator of a core subset of IFN and cytokine regulatory genes in response to RSV. Of these IRF1 is upstream of the type III IFN and ISG response. We find that RSV modulates the XBP1s binding complex on the IRF1 5' enhancer whose activation is required for IRF1 expression. These findings provide novel insight into how the IRE1α-XBP1s pathway potentiates airway mucosal anti-viral responses.Copyright © 2023 Qiao, Xu, Zhang, Yang and Brasier."
"37591842","A deep learning method for replicate-based analysis of chromosome conformation contacts using Siamese neural networks.","Nat Commun","The organisation of the genome in nuclear space is an important frontier of biology. Chromosome conformation capture methods such as Hi-C and Micro-C produce genome-wide chromatin contact maps that provide rich data containing quantitative and qualitative information about genome architecture. Most conventional approaches to genome-wide chromosome conformation capture data are limited to the analysis of pre-defined features, and may therefore miss important biological information. One constraint is that biologically important features can be masked by high levels of technical noise in the data. Here we introduce a replicate-based method for deep learning from chromatin conformation contact maps. Using a Siamese network configuration our approach learns to distinguish technical noise from biological variation and outperforms image similarity metrics across a range of biological systems. The features extracted from Hi-C maps after perturbation of cohesin and CTCF reflect the distinct biological functions of cohesin and CTCF in the formation of domains and boundaries, respectively. The learnt distance metrics are biologically meaningful, as they mirror the density of cohesin and CTCF binding. These properties make our method a powerful tool for the exploration of chromosome conformation capture data, such as Hi-C capture Hi-C, and Micro-C.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."

Challenges include no effective therapeutic target, intra- and intertumoral heterogeneity, inadequate effective drugs, and an immunosuppressive microenvironment, etc. Deciphering the pathogenesis of gliomas and finding out the working mechanisms are urgent and necessary for glioma treatment. Identification of prognostic biomarkers and targeting the biomarker genes will be a promising therapy.From our RNA-sequencing data of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)-inhibition sensitive and OXPHOS-resistant cell lines, we found that the scaffolding protein caveolin 1 (CAV1) is highly expressed in the resistant group but not in the sensitive group. By comprehensive analysis of our RNA sequencing data, Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS) data and public databases, we found that CAV1 is highly expressed in gliomas and its expression is positively related with pathological processes, higher CAV1 predicts shorter overall survival.Further analysis indicated that (1) the differentiated genes in CAV1-high groups are enriched in immune infiltration and immune response; (2) CAV1 is positively correlated with tumor metastasis markers; (3) the methylation level of CAV1 promoters in glioma group is lower in higher stage than that in lower stage; (4) CAV1 is positively correlated with glioma stemness; (5) higher expression of CAV1 renders the glioma cells' resistant to oxidative phosphorylation inhibitors.Therefore, we identified a key gene CAV1 and deciphered its function in glioma progression and prognosis, proposing that CAV1 may be a therapeutic target for gliomas.© 2023.

However, the mechanisms that drive these phenotypic innovations remain poorly understood, in part because of the lack of high-quality cellular resolution data in human and non-human primates. Here, we take advantage of single-cell expression data from the middle temporal gyrus of five primates (human, chimp, gorilla, macaque and marmoset) to identify 57 homologous cell types and generate cell type-specific gene co-expression networks for comparative analysis. Although orthologue expression patterns are generally well conserved, we find 24% of genes with extensive differences between human and non-human primates (3,383 out of 14,131), which are also associated with multiple brain disorders. To assess the functional significance of gene expression differences in an evolutionary context, we evaluate changes in network connectivity across meta-analytic co-expression networks from 19 animals. We find that a subset of these genes has deeply conserved co-expression across all non-human animals, and strongly divergent co-expression relationships in humans (139 out of 3,383, <1% of primate orthologues). Genes with human-specific cellular expression and co-expression profiles (such as NHEJ1, GTF2H2, C2 and BBS5) typically evolve under relaxed selective constraints and may drive rapid evolutionary change in brain function.© 2023.

The RNA modification status of 5-Methylcytosine (m5C) has been shown to be a biomarker for various diseases, but its potentiality to be a diagnostic biomarker for NSCLC remained inconclusive.Methods:In this research, we collected peripheral leukocyte samples from 141 patients with NSCLC and 90 normal people as controls to evaluate the extent of m5C RNA modification.Results:We found that the m5C modification levels in leukocytes of NSCLC patients were decreased dramatically, which were compared to the normal controls, and levels of m5C modification decreased progressively with tumor stage. Importantly, m5C modification exhibited superior diagnostic value compared to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC), cytokeratin 19 fragment (Cyfra21-1), and carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA125), which demonstrated area under the curves (AUCs) of 0.912, 0.773, 0.669, 0.754, and 0.732, respectively. The combination of m5C modification with these serum tumor biomarkers further improved the AUC to 0.960. A nomogram model incorporating m5C modification also provided an effectively diagnostic tool for NSCLC.Conclusion:Collectively, our findings suggested that m5C modification in leukocytes held promise as a prospective biomarker for NSCLC diagnosis.© The author(s)."

The relationship between the type and level of metal exposure and epigenetic changes in subjects exposed to high concentrations of metals in the environment is not yet clear. The aim of our study is to find the possible association of environmental long-term exposure to metals with DNA methylation changes of genes related to immune response and carcinogenesis. We investigated the association of plasma levels of 21 essential and non-essential metals detected by ICP-MS and the methylation level of 654 CpG sites located on NFKB1, CDKN2A, ESR1, APOA5, IGF2 and H19 genes assessed by targeted bisulfite sequencing in a cohort of 40 subjects living near metal mining area and 40 unexposed subjects. Linear regression was conducted to find differentially methylated positions with adjustment for gender, age, BMI class, smoking and metal concentration.In the metal-exposed group, five CpGs in the NFKB1 promoter region were hypomethylated compared to unexposed group. Four differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were associated with multiple metals, two of them are located on NFKB1 gene, and one each on CDKN2A gene and ESR1 gene. Two DMPs located on NFKB1 (chr4:102500951, associated with Be) and IGF2 (chr11:2134198, associated with U) are associated with specific metal levels. The methylation status of the seven CpGs located on NFKB1 (3), ESR1 (2) and CDKN2A (2) positively correlated with plasma levels of seven metals (As, Sb, Zn, Ni, U, I and Mn).Our study revealed methylation changes in NFKB1, CDKN2A, IGF2 and ESR1 genes in individuals with long-term human exposure to metals.

Growing evidence suggest an interconnection between periodontitis and IBD, implying a shift from the traditional concept of independent diseases to a complex, reciprocal cycle. This review outlines the evidence supporting an Oral-Gut axis, marked by a higher prevalence of periodontitis in IBD patients and vice versa. The specific mechanisms linking periodontitis and IBD remain to be fully elucidated, but emerging evidence points to the ectopic colonization of the gut by oral bacteria, which promote intestinal inflammation by activating host immune responses. This review presents an in-depth examination of the interconnection between periodontitis and IBD, highlighting the shared microbiological and immunological pathways, and proposing a multi-hit hypothesis in the pathogenesis of periodontitis-mediated intestinal inflammation. Furthermore, the review underscores the critical need for a collaborative approach between dentists and gastroenterologists to provide holistic oral-systemic healthcare."
"37607912","Bile acid-dependent transcription factors and chromatin accessibility determine regional heterogeneity of intestinal antimicrobial peptides.","Nat Commun","Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are important mediators of intestinal immune surveillance. However, the regional heterogeneity of AMPs and its regulatory mechanisms remain obscure. Here, we clarified the regional heterogeneity of intestinal AMPs at the single-cell level, and revealed a cross-lineages AMP regulation mechanism that bile acid dependent transcription factors (BATFs), NR1H4, NR1H3 and VDR, regulate AMPs through a ligand-independent manner. Bile acids regulate AMPs by perturbing cell differentiation rather than activating BATFs signaling. Chromatin accessibility determines the potential of BATFs to regulate AMPs at the pre-transcriptional level, thus shaping the regional heterogeneity of AMPs. The BATFs-AMPs axis also participates in the establishment of intestinal antimicrobial barriers of fetuses and the defects of antibacterial ability during Crohn's disease. Overall, BATFs and chromatin accessibility play essential roles in shaping the regional heterogeneity of AMPs at pre- and postnatal stages, as well as in maintenance of antimicrobial immunity during homeostasis and disease.© 2023.

"37580713","Global serum profiling: an opportunity for earlier cancer detection.","J Exp Clin Cancer Res","The advances in cancer research achieved in the last 50 years have been remarkable and have provided a deeper knowledge of this disease in many of its conceptual and biochemical aspects. From viewing a tumor as a 'simple' aggregate of mutant cells and focusing on detecting key cell changes leading to the tumorigenesis, the understanding of cancer has broadened to consider it as a complex organ interacting with its close and far surroundings through tumor and non-tumor cells, metabolic mechanisms, and immune processes. Metabolism and the immune system have been linked to tumorigenesis and malignancy progression along with cancer-specific genetic mutations. However, most technologies developed to overcome the barriers to earlier detection are focused solely on genetic information. The concept of cancer as a complex organ has led to research on other analytical techniques, with the quest of finding a more sensitive and cost-effective comprehensive approach. Furthermore, artificial intelligence has gained broader consensus in the oncology community as a powerful tool with the potential to revolutionize cancer diagnosis for physicians. We herein explore the relevance of the concept of cancer as a complex organ interacting with the bodily surroundings, and focus on promising emerging technologies seeking to diagnose cancer earlier, such as liquid biopsies. We highlight the importance of a comprehensive approach to encompass all the tumor and non-tumor derived information salient to earlier cancer detection.© 2023.

Diosgenin is a steroidal sapogenin with known neuroprotective and antioxidant properties. This study aimed to assess the pharmacological potential of diosgenin in a single prolonged stress (SPS) model of PTSD, plus other behavioral models along with any consequent alterations in brain neurochemistry in male mice.Methodology:SPS was induced by restraining animals for 2 h, followed by 20 min of forced swim, recuperation for 15 min, and finally, exposure to ether to induce anesthesia. The SPS-exposed animals were treated with diosgenin (20, 40, and 60 mg/kg) and compared with the positive controls, fluoxetine or donepezil, then they were observed for any changes in anxiety/depression-like behaviors, and cognitive impairment. After behavioral screening, postmortem serotonin, noradrenaline, dopamine, vitamin C, adenosine and its metabolites inosine and hypoxanthine were quantified in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, and striatum by high-performance liquid chromatography. Additionally, animal serum was screened for changes in corticosterone levels.Results:The results showed that diosgenin reversed anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, and ameliorated cognitive impairment in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, diosgenin restored monoamine and vitamin C levels dose-dependently and modulated adenosine and its metabolites in the brain regions. Diosgenin also reinstated otherwise increased serum corticosterone levels in SPS mice.Conclusion:The findings suggest that diosgenin may be a potential candidate for improving symptoms of PTSD.Copyright © 2023 Malik, Usman, Arif, Ahmed, Ali, Rauf and Sewell."

Other prognostic factors reported include histopathological assessments of the tumour, tumour mutations and proteins in the blood. As some of these factors are strongly correlated, it is important to evaluate the independent effects they may have on survival.Tumour samples from 2162 CRC patients were visually assessed for amount of tumour stroma, severity of lymphocytic infiltrate at the tumour margins and the presence of lymphoid follicles. Somatic mutations in the tumour were assessed for 2134 individuals. Pre-surgical levels of 4963 plasma proteins were measured in 128 individuals. The associations between these features and prognosis were inspected by a Cox Proportional Hazards Model (CPH).Levels of stroma, lymphocytic infiltration and presence of lymphoid follicles all associate with prognosis, along with high tumour mutation burden, high microsatellite instability and TP53 and BRAF mutations. The somatic mutations are correlated with the histopathology and none of the somatic mutations associate with survival in a multivariate analysis. Amount of stroma and lymphocytic infiltration associate with local invasion of tumours. Elevated levels of two plasma proteins, CA-125 and PPP1R1A, associate with a worse prognosis.Tumour stroma and lymphocytic infiltration variables are strongly associated with prognosis of CRC and capture the prognostic effects of tumour mutation status.

In the laboratory, haploid S. cerevisiae cells of a single mating type can acquire an amyloid prion in one of two ways (i) spontaneous nucleation of the prion within the yeast cell, and (ii) receipt via mother-to-daughter transmission during the cell division cycle. Similarly, prions can be lost due to (i) dissolution of the prion amyloid by its breakage into non-amyloid monomeric units, or (ii) preferential donation/retention of prions between the mother and daughter during cell division. Here we present a computational tool (Monitoring Induction and Loss of prions in Cells; MIL-CELL) for modelling these four general processes using a multiscale approach describing both spatial and kinetic aspects of the yeast life cycle and the amyloid-prion behavior. We describe the workings of the model, assumptions upon which it is based and some interesting simulation results pertaining to the wave-like spread of the epigenetic prion elements through the yeast population. MIL-CELL is provided as a stand-alone GUI executable program for free download with the paper. MIL-CELL is equipped with a relational database allowing all simulated properties to be searched, collated and graphed. Its ability to incorporate variation in heritable properties means MIL-CELL is also capable of simulating loss of the isogenic nature of a cell population over time.

Accumulating evidence has begun to elucidate the multifaceted ways in which H2S influences the epigenetic landscape and, subsequently, the progression of various neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease. H2S can modulate key components of the epigenetic machinery, such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs, impacting gene expression and cellular functions relevant to neuronal survival, inflammation, and synaptic plasticity. We synthesize recent research that positions H2S as an essential player within this intricate network, with the potential to open new therapeutic avenues for these currently incurable conditions. Despite significant progress, there remains a considerable gap in our understanding of the precise molecular mechanisms and the potential therapeutic implications of modulating H2S levels or its downstream targets. We conclude by identifying future directions for research aimed at exploiting the therapeutic potential of H2S in neurodegenerative diseases."
"37566041","The Promise of Epigenetics Research in the Treatment of Appendiceal Neoplasms.","Cells","Appendiceal cancers (AC) are a rare and heterogeneous group of malignancies. Historically, appendiceal neoplasms have been grouped with colorectal cancers (CRC), and treatment strategies have been modeled after CRC management guidelines due to their structural similarities and anatomical proximity. However, the two have marked differences in biological behavior and treatment response, and evidence suggests significant discrepancies in their respective genetic profiles. In addition, while the WHO classification for appendiceal cancers is currently based on traditional histopathological criteria, studies have demonstrated that histomorphology does not correlate with survival or treatment response in AC. Due to their rarity, appendiceal cancers have not been studied as extensively as other gastrointestinal cancers. However, their incidence has been increasing steadily over the past decade, making it crucial to identify new and more effective strategies for detection and treatment. Recent efforts to map and understand the molecular landscape of appendiceal cancers have unearthed a wealth of information that has made it evident that appendiceal cancers possess a unique molecular profile, distinct from other gastrointestinal cancers. This review focuses on the epigenetic landscape of epithelial appendiceal cancers and aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge of epigenetic changes across different appendiceal cancer subtypes, highlighting the challenges as well as the promise of employing epigenetics in the quest for the detection of biomarkers, therapeutic targets, surveillance markers, and predictors of treatment response and survival in epithelial appendiceal neoplasms."
"37577516","Neuron-specific chromatin disruption at CpG islands and aging-related regions in Kabuki syndrome mice.","bioRxiv","Many Mendelian developmental disorders caused by coding variants in epigenetic regulators have now been discovered. Epigenetic regulators are broadly expressed, and each of these disorders typically exhibits phenotypic manifestations from many different organ systems. An open question is whether the chromatin disruption - the root of the pathogenesis - is similar in the different disease-relevant cell types. This is possible in principle, since all these cell-types are subject to effects from the same causative gene, that has the same kind of function (e.g. methylates histones) and is disrupted by the same germline variant. We focus on mouse models for Kabuki syndrome types 1 and 2, and find that the chromatin accessibility abnormalities in neurons are mostly distinct from those in B or T cells. This is not because the neuronal abnormalities occur at regulatory elements that are only active in neurons. Neurons, but not B or T cells, show preferential chromatin disruption at CpG islands and at regulatory elements linked to aging. A sensitive analysis reveals that the regions disrupted in B/T cells do exhibit chromatin accessibility changes in neurons, but these are very subtle and of uncertain functional significance. Finally, we are able to identify a small set of regulatory elements disrupted in all three cell types. Our findings reveal the cellular-context-specific effect of variants in epigenetic regulators, and suggest that blood-derived ""episignatures"" may not be well-suited for understanding the mechanistic basis of neurodevelopment in Mendelian disorders of the epigenetic machinery."

Using various R packages, GSEA software, and the STRING database, we conducted data analysis, gene set enrichment, and protein-protein interaction predictions. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms aided in feature gene selection, while the predictive model's efficiency was evaluated via the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. We used the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) method for molecular typing and the cell-type identification by estimating relative subsets of RNA transcripts (CIBERSORT) algorithm for predicting immune cell infiltration.TheDLATandLDHAgenes may regulate the immune microenvironment of DCM by influencing activated dendritic cells, activated mast cells, and M0 macrophages, respectively.

The objective of the study is to evaluate the prognostic utility of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging for predicting good neurologic recovery in unresponsive patients with severe brain injury in the intensive-care unit.Each patient underwent a 5.5-min resting-state scan and ten resting-state networks were extracted via independent component analysis. The Glasgow Outcome Scale was used to classify patients into good and poor outcome groups. The Nearest Centroid classifier used each patient's ten resting-state network values to predict best neurologic outcome within 6 months post-injury.Of the 25 patients enrolled (mean age = 43.68, range = [19-69]; GCS ≤ 9; 6 females), 10 had good and 15 had poor outcome. The classifier correctly and confidently predicted 8/10 patients with good and 12/15 patients with poor outcome (mean = 0.793, CI = [0.700, 0.886], Z = 2.843, p = 0.002). The prediction performance was largely determined by three visual (medial: Z = 3.11, p = 0.002; occipital pole: Z = 2.44, p = 0.015; lateral: Z = 2.85, p = 0.004) and the left frontoparietal network (Z = 2.179, p = 0.029).Our approach correctly identified good functional outcome with higher sensitivity (80%) than traditional prognostic measures. By revealing preserved networks in the absence of discernible behavioral signs, functional connectivity may aid in the prognostic process and affect the outcome of discussions surrounding withdrawal of life-sustaining measures.© 2023.

To enable prophylaxis in the prevention of PE, pregnancies at risk of PE must be identified early-in the first trimester. To identify at-risk pregnancies we profiled methylomes of plasma-derived, cell-free DNA from 498 pregnant women, of whom about one-third developed early-onset PE. We detected DNA methylation differences between control and PE pregnancies that enabled risk stratification at PE diagnosis but also presymptomatically, at around 12 weeks of gestation (range 9-14 weeks). The first-trimester risk prediction model was validated in an external cohort collected from two centers (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.75) and integrated with routinely available maternal risk factors (AUC = 0.85). The combined risk score correctly predicted 72% of patients with early-onset PE at 80% specificity. These preliminary results suggest that cell-free DNA methylation profiling is a promising tool for presymptomatic PE risk assessment, and has the potential to improve treatment and follow-up in the obstetric clinic.© 2023.

"37654976","Elevated Maternal Testosterone Levels Alter PFOA Elimination and Tissue Distribution in Pregnant Rats.","J Environ Sci Public Health","Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is an enduring synthetic chemical that harms human health. Recent studies indicate heightened bioaccumulation of PFOA, particularly in pregnant women experiencing preeclampsia. Since plasma testosterone levels are elevated in pregnant women with preeclampsia, we hypothesized that hyperandrogenic conditions during pregnancy may hinder PFOA elimination and contribute to their higher body burden. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were s/c injected with vehicle or testosterone propionate from gestational day (GD) 15 to 20 to increase plasma testosterone levels by 2-fold, similar to levels in preeclampsia. On GD 16, [14C]-PFOA (9.4 pmol/kg) was given intravenously, and subsequently,14C radioactivity was measured in maternal blood, urine, feces, and tissues. PFOA was primarily eliminated through urine; however, less PFOA was excreted in urine of pregnant rats with elevated testosterone levels than controls. Fecal excretion of PFOA was minimal and did not significantly differ between groups. The total elimination of PFOA (urine plus feces) was significantly reduced by 12% in pregnant rats with elevated testosterone levels. In controls, PFOA distribution was highest in placenta, followed by the kidneys, liver, brain, heart, lungs, and spleen. Pregnant rats with elevated testosterone levels displayed 12% higher concentrations of PFOA in these tissues than controls. Furthermore, the renal expression ofOat2andOat3was significantly decreased, whileOatp1andOat-kexpression was significantly increased in pregnant rats with elevated testosterone levels than controls. In conclusion, elevated maternal testosterone levels decrease urinary elimination of PFOA, possibly through altered expression of renal transporters leading to increased tissue concentrations of PFOA in pregnant rats."
"37620817","Association of mitochondrial DNA copy number with chronic kidney disease in older adults.","BMC Geriatr","Mitochondrial dysfunction in kidney cells has been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Estimation of mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA-CN) is considered a convenient method for representing mitochondrial function in large samples. However, no study has investigated the association between mtDNA-CN and CKD in older adults with the highest prevalence. The objective is to examine cross-sectional and prospective associations between mtDNA-CN values and CKD risk in older adults to determine whether mtDNA-CN represents a novel potential biomarker for the recognition of CKD risk.In a Chinese community-based cohort of over 65-year-olds, we included 14,467 participants (52.6% females). CKD was defined by eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2or ICD-10 codes (patients = 3831 (26.5%)). Participants had peripheral blood levels of mtDNA-CN calculated from probe intensities of the Axiom CAS Array.The risk of CKD prevalence decreased with mtDNA-CN per 1-SD increment, independent of established risk factors for older CKD (odds ratio [OR] per SD 0.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.86, 0.93, P < 0.001), and has comparable strength of association with these established risk factors. Furthermore, the progression of kidney function was stratified according to the worsening of eGFR categories. The risk of kidney function progression to a more severe stage gradually decreased as the mtDNA-CN increased (P trend < 0.001). Non-CKD participants in the highest quartile of mtDNA-CN had a lower risk of developing CKD compared to the lowest quartile within 2 years of follow-up, reducing the risk of CKD by 36% (95% CI 0.42, 0.97; P = 0.037).Based on the analysis of the largest sample to date investigating the association between mtDNA-CN and CKD in older adults, higher levels of mtDNA-CN were found to be associated with a lower risk of CKD, suggesting that a reduced level of mtDNA-CN is a potential risk factor for CKD.© 2023.

The aim of this systematic review was to analyze the performance, external validity, and generalizability of AI models for technical skill assessment in minimally invasive surgery.A systematic search of Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore was performed to identify original articles reporting the use of AI in the assessment of technical skill in minimally invasive surgery. Risk of bias (RoB) and quality of the included studies were analyzed according to Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies criteria and the modified Joanna Briggs Institute checklists, respectively. Findings were reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement.In total, 1958 articles were identified, 50 articles met eligibility criteria and were analyzed. Motion data extracted from surgical videos (n = 25) or kinematic data from robotic systems or sensors (n = 22) were the most frequent input data for AI. Most studies used deep learning (n = 34) and predicted technical skills using an ordinal assessment scale (n = 36) with good accuracies in simulated settings. However, all proposed models were in development stage, only 4 studies were externally validated and 8 showed a low RoB.AI showed good performance in technical skill assessment in minimally invasive surgery. However, models often lacked external validity and generalizability. Therefore, models should be benchmarked using predefined performance metrics and tested in clinical implementation studies.© 2023.

After extracting their DNA, three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) ofC10orf90were genotyped to analyze the potential relationship between these variants and CRC risk. PLINK software packages (version 1.07) were used to evaluate multiple genetic models by calculating the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). The best SNP-SNP interaction model was defined by the multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis.C10orf90rs12412320 was significantly associated with CRC risk (p= 0.006) and might be associated with the lower CRC risk (OR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.65-0.93). The relationship of rs12412320 with lower CRC risk was found in people aged >60 years and ≤60 years, women, non-smokers, or non-drinkers. Rs11245008 in people aged ≤60 years and rs11245007 among men had a higher CRC susceptibility. Rs12412320 was related to the lower risk of advanced stages (III/IV stage), while rs11245007 might be associated with the higher risk of advanced stages (III/IV stage).

"37592121",NA,NA,"Circulatory shock is defined syndromically as hypotension associated with tissue hypoperfusion and often subcategorized according to hemodynamic profile (e.g., distributive, cardiogenic, hypovolemic) and etiology (e.g., infection, myocardial infarction, trauma, among others). These shock subgroups are generally considered homogeneous entities in research and clinical practice. This current definition fails to consider the complex pathophysiology of shock and the influence of patient heterogeneity. Recent translational evidence highlights previously under-appreciated heterogeneity regarding the underlying pathways with distinct host-response patterns in circulatory shock syndromes. This heterogeneity may confound the interpretation of trial results as a given treatment may preferentially impact distinct subgroups. Re-analyzing results of major 'neutral' treatment trials from the perspective of biological mechanisms (i.e., host-response signatures) may reveal treatment effects in subgroups of patients that share treatable traits (i.e., specific biological signatures that portend a predictable response to a given treatment). In this review, we discuss the emerging literature suggesting the existence of distinct biomarker-based host-response patterns of circulatory shock syndrome independent of etiology or hemodynamic profile.

Chronic inflammation of the synovial tissue ushers loss of function of the joint that severely impacts the patient's quality of life, eventually leading to disability and life-threatening comorbidities. The pathogenesis of synovial inflammation is the consequence of compounded immune and stromal cell interactions influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Deciphering the complexity of the synovial cellular landscape has accelerated primarily due to the utilisation of bulk and single cell RNA sequencing. Particularly the capacity to generate cell-cell interaction networks could reveal evidence of previously unappreciated processes leading to disease. However, there is currently a lack of universal nomenclature as a result of varied experimental and technological approaches that discombobulates the study of synovial inflammation. While spatial transcriptomic analysis that combines anatomical information with transcriptomic data of synovial tissue biopsies promises to provide more insights into disease pathogenesis, in vitro functional assays with single-cell resolution will be required to validate current bioinformatic applications. In order to provide a comprehensive approach and translate experimental data to clinical practice, a combination of clinical and molecular data with machine learning has the potential to enhance patient stratification and identify individuals at risk of arthritis that would benefit from early therapeutic intervention.

Single-cell omics technology provides a new opportunity to decipher the early molecular events of oocyte growth in mammals. Here we focused on analyzing oocytes that were collected from antral follicles in different diameters of porcine pubertal ovaries, and used single-cell M&T-seq technology to analyze the nuclear DNA methylome and cytoplasmic transcriptome in parallel for 62 oocytes. 10× Genomics single-cell transcriptomic analyses were also performed to explore the bi-directional cell-cell communications within antral follicles. A new pipeline, methyConcerto, was developed to specifically and comprehensively characterize the methylation profile and allele-specific methylation events for a single-cell methylome. We characterized the gene expressions and DNA methylations of individual oocyte in porcine antral follicle, and both active and inactive gene's bodies displayed high methylation levels, thereby enabled defining two distinct types of oocytes. Although the methylation levels of Type II were higher than that of Type I, Type II contained nearly two times more of cytoplasmic transcripts than Type I. Moreover, the imprinting methylation patterns of Type II were more dramatically divergent than Type I, and the gene expressions and DNA methylations of Type II were more similar with that of MII oocytes. The crosstalk between granulosa cells and Type II oocytes was active, and these observations revealed that Type II was more poised for maturation. We further confirmed Insulin Receptor Substrate-1 in insulin signaling pathway is a key regulator on maturation by in vitro maturation experiments.

"37442235","Spontaneous histone exchange between nucleosomes.","J Biol Chem","The nucleosome is the fundamental gene-packing unit in eukaryotes. Nucleosomes comprise ∼147 bp DNA wrapped around an octameric histone protein core composed of two H2A-H2B dimers and one (H3-H4)2tetramer. The strong yet flexible DNA-histone interactions are the physical basis of the dynamic regulation of genes packaged in chromatin. The dynamic nature of DNA-histone interactions also implies that nucleosomes dissociate DNA-histone contacts both transiently and repeatedly. This kinetic instability may lead to spontaneous nucleosome disassembly or histone exchange between nucleosomes. At high nucleosome concentrations, nucleosome-nucleosome collisions and subsequent histone exchange would be a more likely event, where nucleosomes could act as their own histone chaperone. This spontaneous histone exchange could serve as a mechanism for maintaining overall chromatin stability, although it has never been reported. Here we employed three-color single-molecule FRET (smFRET) to demonstrate that histone H2A-H2B dimers are exchanged spontaneously between nucleosomes on a time scale of a few tens of seconds at a physiological nucleosome concentration. We show that the rate of histone exchange increases at a higher monovalent salt concentration, with histone-acetylated nucleosomes, and in the presence of histone chaperone Nap1, while it remains unchanged at a higher temperature, and decreases upon DNA methylation. These results support the notion of histone exchange via transient and repetitive partial disassembly of the nucleosome and corroborate spontaneous histone diffusion in a compact chromatin context, modulating the local concentrations of histone modifications and variants.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

AlkB homolog1 (ALKBH1) is shown to demethylate DNA adenine methylation (6mA) preferentially from single-stranded or unpaired DNA, while its demethylase activity and function in the chromatin context are unclear.Here, we find that loss-of-function of the rice ALKBH1 gene leads to increased 6mA in the R-loop regions of the genome but has a limited effect on the overall 6mA level. However, in the context of mixed tissues, rather than on individual loci, the ALKBH1 mutation or overexpression mainly affects the expression of genes with a specific combination of chromatin modifications in the body region marked with H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 but depleted of DNA CG methylation. In the similar context of mixed tissues, further analysis reveals that the ALKBH1 protein preferentially binds to genes marked by the chromatin signature and has a function to maintain a high H3K4me3/H3K27me3 ratio by impairing the binding of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) to the targets, which is required for both the basal and stress-induced expression of the genes.Our findings unravel a function of ALKBH1 to control the balance between the antagonistic histone methylations for gene activity and provide insight into the regulatory mechanism of PRC2-mediated H3K27me3 deposition within the gene body region.© 2023.

"37644049",NA,NA,"Mobility of transposable elements (TEs) frequently leads to insertional mutations in functional DNA regions. In the potentially immortal germline, TEs are effectively suppressed by the Piwi-piRNA pathway. However, in the genomes of ageing somatic cells lacking the effects of the pathway, TEs become increasingly mobile during the adult lifespan, and their activity is associated with genomic instability. Whether the progressively increasing mobilization of TEs is a cause or a consequence of ageing remains a fundamental problem in biology. Here we show that in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the downregulation of active TE families extends lifespan. Ectopic activation of Piwi proteins in the soma also promotes longevity. Furthermore, DNA N6-adenine methylation at TE stretches gradually rises with age, and this epigenetic modification elevates their transcription as the animal ages. These results indicate that TEs represent a novel genetic determinant of ageing, and that N6-adenine methylation plays a pivotal role in ageing control.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."

PTMs play essential roles in biological function and regulation and have been linked with several diseases. Modifications of protein acylation (Kac), a type of PTM, are known to induce epigenetic regulatory processes that promote various diseases. Thus, an increasing number of studies focusing on acylation modifications are being undertaken. Butyrylation (Kbu) is a new acylation process found in animals and plants. Kbu has been recently linked to the onset and progression of several diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and vascular dementia. Moreover, the mode of action of certain drugs used in the treatment of lymphoma and colon cancer is based on the regulation of butyrylation levels, suggesting that butyrylation may play a therapeutic role in these diseases. In addition, butyrylation is also commonly involved in rice gene expression and thus plays an important role in the growth, development, and metabolism of rice. The tools and analytical methods that could be utilized for the prediction and detection of lysine butyrylation have also been investigated. This study reviews the potential role of histone Kbu, as well as the mechanisms underlying this process.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of different media components and culture methods on the BCSC-associated immunophenotypes and gene expression in ER + PDBCCs.Ten patients with ER + breast cancer were employed in this study, six of whom had neoadjuvant chemotherapy and four of whom did not. PDBCCs were isolated by enzymatic methods using collagen I and hyaluronidase. PDBCCs were grown as monolayers in mediums with different compositions and as multicellular spheroid in a suspended condition. Collagen I-coated plate and ultralow attachment plate coated with polymer-X were used for monolayer and spheroid culture. Flow cytometry, immunofluorescent staining, RT-PCR, and RNA-sequencing were employed to examine the immunophenotype and genetic profile of PDBCCs.More than 95% of PDBCCs sustain EpCAM high/+/fibroblast marker- phenotypes in monolayer conditions by subculturing 3-4 times. A83-01 removal induced senescent cells with high β-galactosidase activity. PDBCCs grown as monolayers were characterized by the majority of cells having an EpCAM+/CD49f + phenotype. Compared to full media in monolayer culture, EGF removal increased EpCAM+/CD49f - phenotype (13.8-fold, p = 0.028), whereas R-spondin removal reduced it (0.8-fold, p = 0.02). A83-01 removal increased EpCAM+/CD24 + phenotype (1.82-fold, p = 0.023) and decreased EpCAM low/-/CD44+/CD24- phenotype (0.45-fold, p = 0.026). Compared to monolayer, spheroid resulted in a significant increase in the population with EpCAM-/CD49+ (14.6-fold, p = 0.006) and EpCAM low/-/CD44+/CD24- phenotypes (4.16-fold, p = 0.022) and ALDH high activity (9.66-fold, p = 0.037). ALDH1A and EMT-related genes were upregulated. In RNA-sequencing analysis between spheroids and monolayers, a total of 561 differentially expressed genes (2-fold change, p < 0.05) were enriched in 27 KEGG pathways including signaling pathways regulating pluripotency of stem cells. In a recurrence-free survival analysis based on the Kaplan-Meier Plotter database of the up-and down-regulated genes identified in spheroids, 15 up-, and 14 down-regulated genes were associated with poor prognosis of breast cancer patients.The media composition and spheroid culture method change in the BCSCs and EMT markers of PDBCCs, implying the importance of defining the media composition and culture method for studying PDBCCs in vitro.© 2023.

In the training cohort, the nomogram showed better goodness of fit than the IPI and NCCN-IPI. The C-index of the nomogram (0.804, 95% CI: 0.751-0.857) outperformed the IPI (0.690, 95% CI: 0.629-0.751) and NCCN-IPI (0.691, 95% CI: 0.632-0.750). The calibration curve, ROC curve, and DCA curve analysis showed that the nomogram has satisfactory predictive power and clinical utility. Similar results were found in the validation cohort.Conclusion:The nomogram integrated with the clinical characteristics and inflammatory markers is beneficial to predict the prognosis of patients with DLBCL."

This disease is featured by a progressive dilation of the abdominal aorta, boosted by atherosclerosis, ageing, and smoking as major risk factors. Aneurysm growth increases the risk of aortic rupture, a life-threatening emergency with high mortality rates. Despite the increasing progress in our knowledge about the etiopathology of AAA, an effective pharmacological treatment against this disorder remains elusive and surgical repair is still the unique available therapeutic approach for high-risk patients. Meanwhile, there is no medical alternative for patients with small aneurysms but close surveillance. Clinical trials assessing the efficacy of antihypertensive agents, statins, doxycycline, or anti-platelet drugs, among others, failed to demonstrate a clear benefit limiting AAA growth, while data from ongoing clinical trials addressing the benefit of metformin on aneurysm progression are eagerly awaited. Recent preclinical studies have postulated new therapeutic targets and pharmacological strategies paving the way for the implementation of future clinical studies exploring these novel therapeutic strategies. This review summarises some of the most relevant clinical and preclinical studies in search of new therapeutic approaches for AAA.© 2023 The Author(s)."

However, the biological processes underlying FAP expression in tumor progression and tumor immunity have not been fully elucidated.We utilized RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) to perform differential analysis of FAP expression in tumor tissues and matched-normal tissues. The relationship between FAP expression and clinical prognosis, DNA methylation, and tumor-infiltrating immune cells in pan-cancer was assessed using R Studio (version 4.2.1). Additionally, we employed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and gene set variation analysis (GSVA) to investigate the biological functions and pathways associated with FAP expression.FAP exhibits high expression in most malignancies, albeit to a lesser extent in CESC, KICH, UCEC, SKCM, THCA, and UCS. Furthermore, FAP is either positively or negatively associated with the prognosis of several malignancies. In seven types of cancer, FAP expression is positively correlated with DNA methylation. CIBERSORT analysis revealed an inverse correlation between FAP expression and T cells, B cells, monocytes, and NK cells, while it exhibited a positive correlation with M0, M1, and M2 macrophages. Enrichment analysis further demonstrated that FAP modulates the cell cycle, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, angiogenesis, and immune-related functions and pathways.Our findings indicate a close relationship between FAP expression and tumorigenesis as well as tumor immunity. FAP has the potential to serve as a diagnostic, prognostic, and immunotherapy marker."
"37564640",NA,NA,"C-reactive protein (CRP) is well-recognized as a sensitive biomarker of inflammation. Association of elevations in plasma/serum CRP level with disease state has received considerable attention, even though CRP is not a specific indicator of a single disease state. Circulating CRP levels have been monitored with a varying degree of success to gauge disease severity or to predict disease progression and outcome. Elevations in CRP level have been implicated as a useful marker to identify patients at risk for cardiovascular disease and certain cancers, and to guide therapy in a context-dependent manner. Since even strong associations do not establish causality, the pathogenic role of CRP has often been over-interpreted. CRP functions as an important modulator of host defense against bacterial infection, tissue injury and autoimmunity. CRP exists in conformationally distinct forms, which exhibit distinct functional properties and help explaining the diverse, often contradictory effects attributed to CRP. In particular, dissociation of native pentameric CRP into its subunits, monomeric CRP, unmasks ""hidden"" pro-inflammatory activities in pentameric CRP. Here, we review recent advances in CRP targeting strategies, therapeutic lowering of circulating CRP level and development of CRP antagonists, and a conformation change inhibitor in particular. We will also discuss their therapeutic potential in mitigating the deleterious actions attributed to CRP under various pathologies, including cardiovascular, pulmonary and autoimmune diseases and cancer.Copyright © 2023 Rizo-Téllez, Sekheri and Filep."

Linear or polynomial regression models were simulated to determine the best fitted age-related function. The metrics were compared with human equivalents in published reports.Macaques exhibited a postnatal eye growth pattern similar to humans, characterized by continuous eye extension coordinated with dramatic reshaping of the lens but not the cornea. The age-related growth of lens thickness (LT), anterior chamber depth (ACD), and axis length (AL) exhibited nonlinear and bipolar patterns. The inflection points were 10 to 12 years old for LT and ACD and 13 to 15 years old for AL in macaques, which were comparable in chronological age at a ratio of ∼1: ratio with that in humans. In contrast, the speed of aging, including the increase in lens density and the decrease in retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, was comparable in relative age at a ratio of ∼1:3 according to the differences in lifespan between macaques and humans. Lens density was a robust indicator for the aging process.Macaque eyes recapitulated the age-related process of human eyes to varying extents with different growth and aging rates. Chronological age or relative age should be considered in different scenarios when macaques are included in preclinical studies."

However, high dimension, extreme sparsity, and large scale of scATAC-seq data have posed great challenges to cell-type identification. Thus, there has been a growing interest in leveraging the well-annotated scRNA-seq data to help annotate scATAC-seq data. However, substantial computational obstacles remain to transfer information from scRNA-seq to scATAC-seq, especially for their heterogeneous features.We propose a new transfer learning method, scNCL, which utilizes prior knowledge and contrastive learning to tackle the problem of heterogeneous features. Briefly, scNCL transforms scATAC-seq features into gene activity matrix based on prior knowledge. Since feature transformation can cause information loss, scNCL introduces neighborhood contrastive learning to preserve the neighborhood structure of scATAC-seq cells in raw feature space. To learn transferable latent features, scNCL uses a feature projection loss and an alignment loss to harmonize embeddings between scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq. Experiments on various datasets demonstrated that scNCL not only realizes accurate and robust label transfer for common types, but also achieves reliable detection of novel types. scNCL is also computationally efficient and scalable to million-scale datasets. Moreover, we prove scNCL can help refine cell-type annotations in existing scATAC-seq atlases.The source code and data used in this paper can be found in https://github.com/CSUBioGroup/scNCL-release.© The Author(s) 2023.

Understanding principles of multiscale dynamics requires simultaneous monitoring of signals in multiple, distributed network nodes. Combining optical and electrical recordings of brain activity is promising for collecting data across multiple scales and can reveal aspects of coordinated dynamics invisible to standard, single-modality approaches. We review recent progress in combining opto- and electrophysiology, focusing on mouse studies that shed new light on the function of single neurons by embedding their activity in the context of brain-wide activity patterns. Optical and electrical readouts can be tailored to desired scales to tackle specific questions. For example, fast dynamics in single cells or local populations recorded with multi-electrode arrays can be related to simultaneously acquired optical signals that report activity in specified subpopulations of neurons, in non-neuronal cells, or in neuromodulatory pathways. Conversely, two-photon imaging can be used to densely monitor activity in local circuits while sampling electrical activity in distant brain areas at the same time. The refinement of combined approaches will continue to reveal previously inaccessible and under-appreciated aspects of coordinated brain activity.© 2023 The Authors."

By leveraging the natural anisotropy, we present a deep self-learning method termed Self-Net that significantly improves the resolution of axial images by using the lateral images from the same raw dataset as rational targets. By incorporating unsupervised learning for realistic anisotropic degradation and supervised learning for high-fidelity isotropic recovery, our method can effectively suppress the hallucination with substantially enhanced image quality compared to previously reported methods. In the experiments, we show that Self-Net can reconstruct high-fidelity isotropic 3D images from organelle to tissue levels via raw images from various microscopy platforms, e.g., wide-field, laser-scanning, or super-resolution microscopy. For the first time, Self-Net enables isotropic whole-brain imaging at a voxel resolution of 0.2 × 0.2 × 0.2 μm3, which addresses the last-mile problem of data quality in single-neuron morphology visualization and reconstruction with minimal effort and cost.

It is the fifth-leading cancer diagnosed in males across the globe. The mortality rate is quite high due to prostate cancer. Despite the fact that advancements in diagnostics and therapeutics have been made, there is a lack of effective drugs. Metabolic pathways are altered due to the triggering of androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathways, and elevated levels of dihydrotestosterone are produced due to defects in AR signaling that accelerate the growth of prostate cancer cells. Further, PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways interact with AR signaling pathway and act as precursors to promote prostate cancer. Prostate cancer therapy has been classified into luminal A, luminal B, and basal subtypes. Therapeutic drugs inhibiting dihydrotestosterone and PI3K have shown to give promising results to combat prostate cancer. Many second-generation Androgen receptor signaling antagonists are given either as single agent or with the combination of other drugs. In order to develop a cure for metastasized prostate cancer cells, Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is applied by using surgical or chemical methods. In many cases, Prostatectomy or local radiotherapy are used to control metastasized prostate cancer. However, it has been observed that after 1.5 years to 2 years of Prostatectomy or castration, there is reoccurrence of prostate cancer and high incidence of castration resistant prostate cancer is seen in population undergone ADT. It has been observed that Androgen derivation therapy combined with drugs like abiraterone acetate or docetaxel improve overall survival rate in metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) patients. Scientific investigations have revealed that drugs inhibiting poly ADP Ribose polymerase (PARP) are showing promising results in clinical trials in the prostate cancer population with mCRPC and DNA repair abnormalities. Recently, RISUG adv (reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance) has shown significant results against prostate cancer cell lines and MTT assay has validated substantial effects of this drug against PC3 cell lines.

As a result, this study aimed to explore the clinicopathological and prognostic values of RACK1 expression in patients with cancer.PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Scopus were comprehensively explored from their inception to April 20, 2023, for selecting studies on the clinicopathological and prognostic role of RACK1 in patients with cancer that met the criteria for inclusion in this review. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the prognosis-predictive value of RACK1 expression, while pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were used to evaluate the correlation between RACK1 expression and the clinicopathological characteristics of patients with cancer. The quality of the included studies was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.Twenty-two studies (13 on prognosis and 20 on clinicopathological characteristics) were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The findings indicated that high RACK1 expression was significantly associated with poor overall survival (HR = 1.62; 95% CI, 1.13-2.33;P = 0.009; I2= 89%) and reversely correlated with disease-free survival/recurrence-free survival (HR = 1.87; 95% CI, 1.22-2.88;P = 0.004; I2= 0%).

The prevalence of this disease is associated with various factors, including age, heredity, and race. Recent research in prostate cancer genetics has identified several genetic variants that may be associated with an increased risk of developing the disease. However, despite the significance of these findings, genetic markers for prostate cancer are not currently utilized in clinical practice as reliable indicators of the disease. In addition to genetics, epigenetic alterations also play a crucial role in prostate cancer development. Aberrant DNA methylation, changes in chromatin structure, and microRNA (miRNA) expression are major epigenetic events that influence oncogenesis. Existing markers for prostate cancer, such as prostate-specific antigen (PSA), have limitations in terms of sensitivity and specificity. The cost of testing, follow-up procedures, and treatment for false-positive results and overdiagnosis contributes to the overall healthcare expenditure. Improving the effectiveness of prostate cancer diagnosis and prognosis requires either narrowing the risk group by identifying new genetic factors or enhancing the sensitivity and specificity of existing markers. Immunological biomarkers (both circulating and intra-tumoral), including markers of immune response and immune dysfunction, represent a potentially useful area of research for enhancing the diagnosis and prognosis of prostate cancer. Our review emphasizes the need for developing novel immunological biomarkers to improve the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of prostate cancer. We highlight the most recent achievements in the identification of biomarkers provided by circulating monocytes and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). We highlight that monocyte-derived and TAM-derived biomarkers can enable to establish the missing links between genetic predisposition, hormonal metabolism and immune responses in prostate cancer."

Most cancers are refractory to conventional diagnostic and chemotherapeutics due to their limited targetability, specificity, solubility, and side effects. The inherent ability of each cancer to evolve through various genetic and epigenetic transformations and metabolic reprogramming underlies therapeutic limitations. Though tumor microenvironments (TMEs) are quite well understood in some cancers, each microenvironment differs from the other in internal perturbations and metabolic skew thereby impeding the development of appropriate diagnostics, drugs, vaccines, and therapies. Cancer associated bioenergetics modulations regulate TME, angiogenesis, immune evasion, generation of resistant niches and tumor progression, and a thorough understanding is crucial to the development of metabolic therapies. However, this remains a missing element in cancer theranostics, necessitating the development of modalities that can be adapted for targetability, diagnostics and therapeutics. In this challenging scenario, nanomaterials are modular platforms for understanding TME and achieving successful theranostics. Several nanoscale particles have been successfully researched in animal models, quite a few have reached clinical trials, and some have achieved clinical success. Nanoparticles exhibit an intrinsic capability to interact with diverse biomolecules and modulate their functions. Furthermore, nanoparticles can be functionalized with receptors, modulators, and drugs to facilitate specific targeting with reduced toxicity. This review discusses the current understanding of different theranostic nanosystems, their synthesis, functionalization, and targetability for therapeutic modulation of bioenergetics, and metabolic reprogramming of the cancer microenvironment.

Fifty-two genetic loci and single nucleotide polymorphisms were related to thyroid cancer. The primary approach in this MR analysis was the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method, and MR‒Egger was the secondary method. Weighted mode and penalized weighted median were used to analyze the sensitivity. In this study, the random-effect IVW models showed the causal impact of genetically predicted thyroid cancer across the IgAN risk (OR, 1.191; 95% CI, 1.131-1.253, P < 0.001). Similar results were also obtained in the weighted mode method (OR, 1.048; 95% CI, 0.980-1.120, P = 0.179) and penalized weighted median (OR, 1.185; 95% CI, 1.110-1.264, P < 0.001). However, the MR‒Egger method revealed that thyroid cancer decreased the risk of IgAN, but this difference was not significant (OR, 0.948; 95% CI, 0.855-1.051, P = 0.316). The leave-one-out sensitivity analysis did not reveal the driving influence of any individual SNP on the association between thyroid cancer and IgAN.The IVW model indicated a significant causality of thyroid cancer with IgAN. However, MR‒Egger had a point estimation in the opposite direction. According to the MR principle, the evidence of this study did not support a stable significant causal association between thyroid cancer and IgAN.

"37666988",NA,NA,"Modified parental histones are segregated symmetrically to daughter DNA strands during replication and can be inherited through mitosis. How this may sustain the epigenome and cell identity remains unknown. Here we show that transmission of histone-based information during DNA replication maintains epigenome fidelity and embryonic stem cell plasticity. Asymmetric segregation of parental histones H3-H4 in MCM2-2A mutants compromised mitotic inheritance of histone modifications and globally altered the epigenome. This included widespread spurious deposition of repressive modifications, suggesting elevated epigenetic noise. Moreover, H3K9me3 loss at repeats caused derepression and H3K27me3 redistribution across bivalent promoters correlated with misexpression of developmental genes. MCM2-2A mutation challenged dynamic transitions in cellular states across the cell cycle, enhancing naïve pluripotency and reducing lineage priming in G1. Furthermore, developmental competence was diminished, correlating with impaired exit from pluripotency. Collectively, this argues that epigenetic inheritance of histone modifications maintains a correctly balanced and dynamic chromatin landscape able to support mammalian cell differentiation.© 2023.

Approximately 83% of all DN pairs within UCNEs showed significant (>10%) non-random genomic arrangements at short distances (2-6 nucleotides) relative to each other. At the extremes, non-randomness in DN spacing distances deviated up to 40% from expected values and were frequently associated with GpC, CpG, ApT, and GpG/CpC dinucleotides. The described peculiarities in DN arrangements have persisted for hundreds of millions of years in vertebrates. These distinctive patterns may suggest that UCNEs have specific DNA conformations."

Most findings of aberrant DNA methylation in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) are array based with limited coverage and resolution, and mainly explored by human papillomavirus (HPV) status, ignoring the high heterogeneity of this disease. In this study, we performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing on a well-studied HNSCC cohort (n= 36) and investigated the methylation changes between fine-scaled HNSCC subtypes in relation to genomic instability, repetitive elements, gene expression, and key carcinogenic pathways. The previously observed hypermethylation phenotype in HPV-positive (HPV+) tumors compared with HPV-negative tumors was robustly present in the immune-strong (IMU) HPV+ subtype but absent in the highly keratinized (KRT) HPV+ subtype. Methylation levels of IMU tumors were significantly higher in repetitive elements, and methylation showed a significant correlation with genomic stability, consistent with the IMU subtype having more genomic stability and better prognosis. Expression quantitative trait methylation (cis-eQTM) analysis revealed extensive functionally-relevant differences, and differential methylation pathway analysis recapitulated gene expression pathway differences between subtypes. Consistent with their characteristics, KRT and HPV-negative tumors had high regulatory potential for multiple regulators of keratinocyte differentiation, which positively correlated with an expression-based keratinization score. Together, our findings revealed distinct mechanisms of carcinogenesis between subtypes in HPV+ HNSCC and uncovered previously ignored epigenomic differences and clinical implications, illustrating the importance of fine-scale subtype analysis in cancer.This study revealed that the previously observed hypermethylation of HPV(+) HNSCC is due solely to the IMU subtype, illustrating the importance of fine-scale subtype analysis in such a heterogeneous disease. Particularly, IMU has significantly higher methylation of transposable elements, which can be tested as a prognosis biomarker in future translational studies.© 2023 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research."
"37568867",NA,NA,"Methylation sequencing is a promising approach to infer the tissue of origin of cell-free DNA (cfDNA). In this study, a single- and a double-stranded library preparation approach were evaluated with respect to their technical biases when applied on cfDNA from plasma and urine. Additionally, tissue of origin (TOO) proportions were evaluated using two deconvolution methods. Sequencing cfDNA from urine using the double-stranded method resulted in a substantial within-read methylation bias and a lower global methylation (56.0% vs. 75.8%,p≤ 0.0001) compared to plasma cfDNA, both of which were not observed with the single-stranded approach. Individual CpG site-based TOO deconvolution resulted in a significantly increased proportion of undetermined TOO with the double-stranded method (urine: 32.3% vs. 1.9%; plasma: 5.9% vs. 0.04%;p≤ 0.0001), but no major differences in proportions of individual cell types. In contrast, fragment-level deconvolution led to multiple cell types, with significantly different TOO proportions between the two methods. This study thus outlines potential limitations of double-stranded library preparation for methylation analysis of cfDNA especially for urinary cfDNA. While the double-stranded method allows jagged end analysis in addition to TOO analysis, it leads to significant methylation bias in urinary cfDNA, which single-stranded methods can overcome."
"37569861","Exploring Molecular Targets for Mitochondrial Therapies in Neurodegenerative Diseases.","Int J Mol Sci","The progressive deterioration of function and structure of brain cells in neurodegenerative diseases is accompanied by mitochondrial dysfunction, affecting cellular metabolism, intracellular signaling, cell differentiation, morphogenesis, and the activation of programmed cell death. However, most of the efforts to develop therapies for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease have focused on restoring or maintaining the neurotransmitters in affected neurons, removing abnormal protein aggregates through immunotherapies, or simply treating symptomatology. However, none of these approaches to treating neurodegeneration can stop or reverse the disease other than by helping to maintain mental function and manage behavioral symptoms. Here, we discuss alternative molecular targets for neurodegeneration treatments that focus on mitochondrial functions, including regulation of calcium ion (Ca2+) transport, protein modification, regulation of glucose metabolism, antioxidants, metal chelators, vitamin supplementation, and mitochondrial transference to compromised neurons. After pre-clinical evaluation and studies in animal models, some of these therapeutic compounds have advanced to clinical trials and are expected to have positive outcomes in subjects with neurodegeneration. These mitochondria-targeted therapeutic agents are an alternative to established or conventional molecular targets that have shown limited effectiveness in treating neurodegenerative diseases."

Here, we used Mendelian randomization (MR) framework to genetically assess the causal nature of multifaceted risk factors on urolithiasis.17 potential risk factors associated with urolithiasis were collected from recently published observational studies, which can be categorized basically into lifestyle factors and circulating biomarkers. The instrumental variables of risk factors were selected from large-scale genome-wide association studies (N ≤ 607,291). Summary-level data on urolithiasis were obtained from UK Biobank (UKB) (3,625 cases and 459,308 noncases) and the FinnGen consortium (5,347 cases and 213,445 noncases). The univariable and multivariable MR analyses were applied to evaluate the causal, independent effect of these potential risk factors upon urolithiasis. Effects from the two consortia were combined by the meta-analysis methods.Higher genetically predicted sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG, OR, 0.708; 95% CI, 0.555 to 0.903), estradiol (OR, 0.179; 95% CI, 0.042 to 0.751), tea intake (OR, 0.550; 95% CI, 0.345 to 0.878), alcoholic drinks per week (OR, 0.992; 95% CI, 0.987 to 0.997), and some physical activity (e.g., swimming, cycling, keeping fit, and bowling, OR, 0.054; 95% CI, 0.008 to 0.363) were significantly associated with a lower risk of urolithiasis. In the Multivariate Mendelian Randomization (MVMR) analyses, the significant causal associations between estradiol, SHBG, tea intake, and alcoholic drinks per week with urolithiasis were robust even after adjusting for potential confounding variables. However, the previously observed causal association between other exercises and urolithiasis was no longer significant after adjusting for these factors.The univariable and multivariable MR findings highlight the independent and significant roles of estradiol, SHBG, tea intake, and alcoholic drinks per week in the development of urolithiasis, which might provide a deeper insight into urolithiasis risk factors and supply potential preventative strategies.Copyright: © 2023 Fang et al.

"37419091","Multi-response Mendelian randomization: Identification of shared and distinct exposures for multimorbidity and multiple related disease outcomes.","Am J Hum Genet","The existing framework of Mendelian randomization (MR) infers the causal effect of one or multiple exposures on one single outcome. It is not designed to jointly model multiple outcomes, as would be necessary to detect causes of more than one outcome and would be relevant to model multimorbidity or other related disease outcomes. Here, we introduce multi-response Mendelian randomization (MR2), an MR method specifically designed for multiple outcomes to identify exposures that cause more than one outcome or, conversely, exposures that exert their effect on distinct responses. MR2uses a sparse Bayesian Gaussian copula regression framework to detect causal effects while estimating the residual correlation between summary-level outcomes, i.e., the correlation that cannot be explained by the exposures, and vice versa. We show both theoretically and in a comprehensive simulation study how unmeasured shared pleiotropy induces residual correlation between outcomes irrespective of sample overlap. We also reveal how non-genetic factors that affect more than one outcome contribute to their correlation. We demonstrate that by accounting for residual correlation, MR2has higher power to detect shared exposures causing more than one outcome. It also provides more accurate causal effect estimates than existing methods that ignore the dependence between related responses. Finally, we illustrate how MR2detects shared and distinct causal exposures for five cardiovascular diseases in two applications considering cardiometabolic and lipidomic exposures and uncovers residual correlation between summary-level outcomes reflecting known relationships between cardiovascular diseases.Crown Copyright © 2023.

Individuals living in regions with endemic malaria have the potential to develop partial immunity, thanks in part to the presence of anti-plasmodium antibodies. As efforts are made to optimize and implement strategies to reduce malaria transmission and ultimately eliminate the disease, it is crucial to understand how these interventions impact naturally acquired protective immunity. To shed light on this, our study focused on assessing antibody responses to a carefully curated library ofP. falciparumrecombinant proteins (n = 691) using samples collected from individuals residing in a low-malaria-transmission region of Thailand. We conducted the antibody assays using the AlphaScreen system, a high-throughput homogeneous proximity-based bead assay that detects protein interactions. We observed that out of the 691 variable surface and merozoite stage proteins included in the library, antibodies to 268 antigens significantly correlated with the absence of symptomatic malaria in an univariate analysis. Notably, the most prominent antigens identified wereP. falciparumerythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) domains. These results align with our previous research conducted in Uganda, suggesting that similar antigens like PfEMP1s might play a pivotal role in determining infection outcomes in diverse populations. To further our understanding, it remains critical to conduct functional characterization of these identified proteins, exploring their potential as correlates of protection or as targets for vaccine development."

Here, we report controlled glial differentiation from hPSCs that bypasses neurogenesis, which otherwise precedes astrogliogenesis during brain development and in vitro differentiation. hPSCs were first differentiated into radial glial cells (RGCs) resembling resident RGCs of the fetal telencephalon, and modulation of specific cell signaling pathways resulted in direct and stepwise induction of key astroglial markers (NFIA, NFIB, SOX9, CD44, S100B, glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]). Transcriptomic and genome-wide epigenetic mapping and single-cell analysis confirmed RGC-to-astrocyte differentiation, obviating neurogenesis and the gliogenic switch. Detailed molecular and cellular characterization experiments uncovered new mechanisms and markers for human RGCs and astrocytes. In summary, establishment of a glia-exclusive neural lineage progression model serves as a unique serum-free platform of manufacturing large numbers of RGCs and astrocytes for neuroscience, disease modeling (e.g., Alexander disease), and regenerative medicine.Published by Elsevier Inc."

In this work, we present a graph-based domain adaptation model, SpaRx, to reveal the heterogeneity of spatial cellular response to drugs. SpaRx transfers the knowledge from pharmacogenomics profiles to single-cell spatial transcriptomics data, through hybrid learning with dynamic adversarial adaption. Comprehensive benchmarking demonstrates the superior and robust performance of SpaRx at different dropout rates, noise levels, and transcriptomics coverage. Further application of SpaRx to the state-of-art single-cell spatial transcriptomics data reveals that tumor cells in different locations of a tumor lesion present heterogenous sensitivity or resistance to drugs.

Infants' feeding with breast milk lowers the likelihood of developing a diverse range of non-communicable diseases later in life and it is also associated with improved neurodevelopmental outcomes. Although the precise mechanisms through which human milk feeding is linked with infants' neurodevelopment are still unknown, potential epigenetic effects of breast milk through its bioactive components, including non-coding RNAs, stem cells and microbiome, could at least partly explain this association. Micro- and long-non-coding RNAs, enclosed in milk exosomes, as well as breast milk stem cells, survive digestion, reach the circulation and can cross the blood-brain barrier. Certain non-coding RNAs potentially regulate genes implicated in brain development and function, whereas nestin-positive stem cells can possibly differentiate into neural cells or/and act as epigenetic regulators in the brain. Furthermore, breast milk microbiota contributes to the establishment of infant's gut microbiome, which is implicated in brain development via epigenetic modifications and key molecules' regulation. This narrative review provides an updated analysis of the relationship between breast milk feeding and infants' neurodevelopment via epigenetics, pointing out how breast milk's bioactive components could have an impact on the neurodevelopment of both full-term and preterm babies."

Here we profile plasma lipidomics from a cohort of 83 people and test which lipids' association with BMI replicates in a concordant direction using our novel tool ScreenDMT, whose power and validity we demonstrate via mathematical proofs and simulations. We find that the linoleic acid diols 12,13-diHOME and 9,10-diHOME both replicably inversely associate with BMI and mechanistically activate calcium fluxes in mouse brown and white adipocytes in vitro.

Multi-omics data can provide more comprehensive biological information for identifying and discovering cancer subtypes. However, existing unsupervised cancer subtyping methods cannot effectively learn comprehensive shared and specific information of multi-omics data. Therefore, a novel method is proposed based on shared and specific representation learning. For each omics data, two autoencoders are applied to extract shared and specific information, respectively. To reduce redundancy and mutual interference, orthogonality constraint is introduced to separate shared and specific information. In addition, contrastive learning is applied to align the shared information and strengthen their consistency. Finally, the obtained shared and specific information for all samples are used for clustering tasks to achieve cancer subtyping. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively capture shared and specific information of multi-omics data and outperform other state-of-the-art methods on cancer subtyping.© 2023 The Author(s)."

Individual PIWI proteins combine these modules in various ways to produce unique PIWI-piRNA pathways, which nevertheless possess the ability to perform conserved functions. This modular model incorporates conserved core mechanisms and accommodates variable co-factors. Adaptability is a hallmark of this RNA-based immune system.

"37610667","From parasites to partners: exploring the intricacies of host-transposon dynamics and coevolution.","Funct Integr Genomics","Transposable elements, often referred to as ""jumping genes,"" have long been recognized as genomic parasites due to their ability to integrate and disrupt normal gene function and induce extensive genomic alterations, thereby compromising the host's fitness. To counteract this, the host has evolved a plethora of mechanisms to suppress the activity of the transposons. Recent research has unveiled the host-transposon relationships to be nuanced and complex phenomena, resulting in the coevolution of both entities. Transposition increases the mutational rate in the host genome, often triggering physiological pathways such as immune and stress responses. Current gene transfer technologies utilizing transposable elements have potential drawbacks, including off-target integration, induction of mutations, and modifications of cellular machinery, which makes an in-depth understanding of the host-transposon relationship imperative. This review highlights the dynamic interplay between the host and transposable elements, encompassing various factors and components of the cellular machinery. We provide a comprehensive discussion of the strategies employed by transposable elements for their propagation, as well as the mechanisms utilized by the host to mitigate their parasitic effects. Additionally, we present an overview of recent research identifying host proteins that act as facilitators or inhibitors of transposition. We further discuss the evolutionary outcomes resulting from the genetic interactions between the host and the transposable elements.

"37651425","Backup transcription factor binding sites protect human genes from mutations in the promoter.","PLoS One","This study was designed to test the idea that the regulatory regions of human genes have evolved to be resistant to the effects of mutations in their primary function, the control of gene expression. It is proposed that the transcription factor/transcription factor binding site (TF/TFBS) pair having the greatest effect on control of a gene is the one with the highest abundance among the regulatory elements. Other pairs would have the same effect on gene expression and would predominate in the event of a mutation in the most abundant pair. It is expected that the overall regulatory design proposed here will be highly resistant to mutagenic change that would otherwise affect expression of the gene. The idea was tested beginning with a database of 42 human genes highly specific for expression in brain. For each gene, the five most abundant TF/TFBS pairs were identified and compared in their TFBS occupancy as measured by their ChIP-seq signal. A similar signal was observed and interpreted as evidence that the TF/TFBS pairs can substitute for one another. TF/TFBS pairs were also compared in their ability to substitute for one another in their effect on the level of gene expression. The study of brain specific genes was complemented with the same analysis performed with 31 human liver specific genes. Like the study of brain genes, the liver results supported the view that TF/TFBS pairs in liver specific genes can substitute for one another in the event of mutagenic damage. Finally, the TFBSs in the brain specific and liver specific gene populations were compared with each other with the goal of identifying any brain selective or liver selective TFBSs. Of the 89 TFBSs in the pooled population, 58 were found only in brain specific but not liver specific genes, 8 only in liver specific but not brain specific genes and 23 were found in both brain and liver specific genes. The results were interpreted to emphasize the large number of TFBS in brain specific genes.Copyright: © 2023 Jay C. Brown.

We aimed to identify which radiomics can discriminate DMG tumor regions (viable tumor and peritumoral edema) from equivalent midline normal tissue (EMNT) in patients with the positive H3.F3K27M mutation, which is associated with a worse prognosis.This was a retrospective study. From a database of 126 DMG patients (children, adolescents, and young adults), only 12 had H3.3K27M mutation and available brain magnetic resonance DICOM file.

"37546924","Multiscale modelling of chromatin 4D organization in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells.","bioRxiv","SARS-CoV-2 is able to re-structure chromatin organization and alters the epigenomic landscape of the host genome, though the mechanisms that produce such changes are still poorly understood. Here, we investigate with polymer physics chromatin re-organization of the host genome, in space and time upon SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. We show that re-structuring of A/B compartments is well explained by a re-modulation of intra-compartment homotypic affinities, which leads to the weakening of A-A interactions and enhances A-B mixing. At TAD level, re-arrangements are physically described by a general reduction of the loop extrusion activity coupled with an alteration of chromatin phase-separation properties, resulting in more intermingling between different TADs and spread in space of TADs themselves. In addition, the architecture of loci relevant to the antiviral interferon (IFN) response, such as DDX58 or IFIT, results more variable within the 3D single-molecule population of the infected model, suggesting that viral infection leads to a loss of chromatin structural specificity. Analysis of time trajectories of pairwise gene-enhancer and higher-order contacts reveals that such variability derives from a more fluctuating dynamics in infected case, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 alters gene regulation by impacting the stability of the contact network in time. Overall, our study provides the first polymer-physics based 4D reconstruction of SARS-CoV-2 infected genome with mechanistic insights on the consequent gene mis-regulation."

Despite recent technological advancements, including single-cell sequencing and the integration of ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data, learning such complex mechanisms from limited independent data points still presents a daunting challenge, impeding GRN inference accuracy. To overcome this challenge, we present LINGER (LIfelong neural Network for GEne Regulation), a novel deep learning-based method to infer GRNs from single-cell multiome data with paired gene expression and chromatin accessibility data from the same cell. LINGER incorporates both 1) atlas-scale external bulk data across diverse cellular contexts and 2) the knowledge of transcription factor (TF) motif matching tocis-regulatory elements as a manifold regularization to address the challenge of limited data and extensive parameter space in GRN inference. Our results demonstrate that LINGER achieves 2-3 fold higher accuracy over existing methods. LINGER reveals a complex regulatory landscape of genome-wide association studies, enabling enhanced interpretation of disease-associated variants and genes. Additionally, following the GRN inference from a reference sc-multiome data, LINGER allows for the estimation of TF activity solely from bulk or single-cell gene expression data, leveraging the abundance of available gene expression data to identify driver regulators from case-control studies. Overall, LINGER provides a comprehensive tool for robust gene regulation inference from genomics data, empowering deeper insights into cellular mechanisms."
"37614671","Day-night fluctuations in choroid plexus transcriptomics and cerebrospinal fluid metabolomics.","PNAS Nexus","The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) provides mechanical protection for the brain and serves as a brain dispersion route for nutrients, hormones, and metabolic waste. The CSF secretion rate is elevated in the dark phase in both humans and rats, which could support the CSF flow along the paravascular spaces that may be implicated in waste clearance. The similar diurnal CSF dynamics pattern observed in the day-active human and the nocturnal rat suggests a circadian regulation of this physiological variable, rather than sleep itself. To obtain a catalog of potential molecular drivers that could provide the day-night-associated modulation of the CSF secretion rate, we determined the diurnal fluctuation in the rat choroid plexus transcriptomic profile with RNA-seq and in the CSF metabolomics with ultraperformance liquid chromatography combined with mass spectrometry. We detected significant fluctuation of 19 CSF metabolites and differential expression of 2,778 choroid plexus genes between the light and the dark phase, the latter of which encompassed circadian rhythm-related genes and several choroid plexus transport mechanisms. The fluctuating components were organized with joint pathway analysis, of which several pathways demonstrated diurnal regulation. Our results illustrate substantial transcriptional and metabolic light-dark phase-mediated changes taking place in the rat choroid plexus and its encircling CSF. The combined data provide directions toward future identification of the molecular pathways governing the fluctuation of this physiological process and could potentially be harnessed to modulate the CSF dynamics in pathology.© The Author(s) 2023.

Emerging evidence suggests that klotho is also an important component of biochemical pathways that regulate hormone balance, which may include those pathways governing testosterone production and men's sexual health, though data are limited and results are mixed.Using a cohort of 767 men from the NHANES 2015-2016 survey cycle, we set out to quantify the association between serum klotho levels and serum testosterone levels, as well as clinical markers of men's sexual health (e.g., testosterone:estrogen ratio, bioavailable testosterone, and free testosterone).Multivariable linear and logistic regression models while controlling for potential confounders were constructed to quantify the relationship between serum klotho and testosterone, as well as between serum klotho and odds of low testosterone (serum testosterone < 300 ng/dL).A positive association was observed between serum klotho and testosterone (β = 0.18, p = 0.04). Serum klotho levels were also stratified into quartiles, and we observed statistically significant increases in testosterone for increasing quartile level of klotho using the first quartile as the reference group (β = 90.51, p = 0.001, β = 106.93, p = 0.002, β = 95.33, p = 0.03 for quartiles 2, 3, and 4, respectively). The average testosterone values by quartiles of klotho were 306.9 ng/dL, 390 ng/dL, 409.3 ng/dL, and 436.6 ng/dL, respectively. We modeled important proxies for sexual health including bioavailable and free testosterone, the testosterone:estradiol ratio, and C-reactive protein. Men in the second quartile of klotho had a significantly lower odds of an abnormal testosterone:estradiol ratio compared to the first quartile [OR = 0.18, 95% CI = (0.03, 0.98)].We observed null associations between continuous serum klotho and odds of low testosterone [OR = 1.0, 95% CI = (1.0, 1.0)], and when stratified by quartile, we observed a significant decrease in the odds of low testosterone for individuals in the second quartile of klotho compared to the first quartile [OR = 0.21, 95% CI = (0.05, 0.91)]. In addition, C-reactive protein was inversely associated with testosterone in men (β = - 4.65, p = 0.001), and inversely associated with quartiles of klotho (β = - 2.28, p = 0.04, β = - 2.22, p = 0.04, β = - 2.28, p = 0.03, for quartiles 2, 3, and 4, respectively).Our findings support previous studies suggesting a role for klotho in testosterone levels and sexual function among men. Future studies are warranted to corroborate these findings, determine clinical significance, and elucidate potential mechanisms underlying these associations.© 2023.

"37603743",NA,NA,"Metabolite levels shape cellular physiology and disease susceptibility, yet the general principles governing metabolome evolution are largely unknown. Here, we introduce a measure of conservation of individual metabolite levels among related species. By analyzing multispecies tissue metabolome datasets in phylogenetically diverse mammals and fruit flies, we show that conservation varies extensively across metabolites. Three major functional properties, metabolite abundance, essentiality, and association with human diseases predict conservation, highlighting a striking parallel between the evolutionary forces driving metabolome and protein sequence conservation. Metabolic network simulations recapitulated these general patterns and revealed that abundant metabolites are highly conserved due to their strong coupling to key metabolic fluxes in the network. Finally, we show that biomarkers of metabolic diseases can be distinguished from other metabolites simply based on evolutionary conservation, without requiring any prior clinical knowledge. Overall, this study uncovers simple rules that govern metabolic evolution in animals and implies that most tissue metabolome differences between species are permitted, rather than favored by natural selection. More broadly, our work paves the way toward using evolutionary information to identify biomarkers, as well as to detect pathogenic metabolome alterations in individual patients."
"37632661","Personalized Cancer Monitoring Assay for the Detection of ctDNA in Patients with Solid Tumors.","Mol Diagn Ther","Highly sensitive molecular assays have been developed to detect plasma-based circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), and emerging evidence suggests their clinical utility for monitoring minimal residual disease and recurrent disease, providing prognostic information, and monitoring therapy responses in patients with solid tumors. The Invitae Personalized Cancer Monitoring™assay uses a patient-specific, tumor-informed variant signature identified through whole exome sequencing to detect ctDNA in peripheral blood of patients with solid tumors.The assay's tumor whole exome sequencing and ctDNA detection components were analytically validated using 250 unique human specimens and nine commercial reference samples that generated 1349 whole exome sequencing and cell-free DNA (cfDNA)-derived libraries. A comparison of tumor and germline whole exome sequencing was used to identify patient-specific tumor variant signatures and generate patient-specific panels, followed by targeted next-generation sequencing of plasma-derived cfDNA using the patient-specific panels with anchored multiplex polymerase chain reaction chemistry leveraging unique molecular identifiers.Whole exome sequencing resulted in overall sensitivity of 99.8% and specificity of > 99.9%. Patient-specific panels were successfully designed for all 63 samples (100%) with ≥ 20% tumor content and 24 (80%) of 30 samples with ≥ 10% tumor content. Limit of blank studies using 30 histologically normal, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens resulted in 100% expected panel design failure. The ctDNA detection component demonstrated specificity of > 99.9% and sensitivity of 96.3% for a combination of 10 ng of cfDNA input, 0.008% allele frequency, 50 variants on the patient-specific panels, and a baseline threshold. Limit of detection ranged from 0.008% allele frequency when utilizing 60 ng of cfDNA input with 18-50 variants in the patient-specific panels (> 99.9% sensitivity) with a baseline threshold, to 0.05% allele frequency when using 10 ng of cfDNA input with an 18-variant panel with a monitoring threshold (> 99.9% sensitivity).The Invitae Personalized Cancer Monitoring assay, featuring a flexible patient-specific panel design with 18-50 variants, demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for detecting ctDNA at variant allele frequencies as low as 0.008%. This assay may support patient prognostic stratification, provide real-time data on therapy responses, and enable early detection of residual/recurrent disease.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37645045","Genome assembly in the telomere-to-telomere era.","ArXiv","De novo assembly is the process of reconstructing the genome sequence of an organism from sequencing reads. Genome sequences are essential to biology, and assembly has been a central problem in bioinformatics for four decades. Until recently, genomes were typically assembled into fragments of a few megabases at best but technological advances in long-read sequencing now enable near complete chromosome-level assembly, also known as telomere-to-telomere assembly, for many organisms. Here we review recent progress on assembly algorithms and protocols. We focus on how to derive near telomere-to-telomere assemblies and discuss potential future developments."
"37527006","Short-read aligner performance in germline variant identification.","Bioinformatics","Read alignment is an essential first step in the characterization of DNA sequence variation. The accuracy of variant-calling results depends not only on the quality of read alignment and variant-calling software but also on the interaction between these complex software tools.In this review, we evaluate short-read aligner performance with the goal of optimizing germline variant-calling accuracy. We examine the performance of three general-purpose short-read aligners-BWA-MEM, Bowtie 2, and Arioc-in conjunction with three germline variant callers: DeepVariant, FreeBayes, and GATK HaplotypeCaller. We discuss the behavior of the read aligners with regard to the data elements on which the variant callers rely, and illustrate how the runtime configurations of these software tools combine to affect variant-calling performance.The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.© The Author(s) 2023.

We examined the emergence and advancements of nanopore sequencing as a significant player in this field. We illustrate the challenges faced in diagnosing mixed infections and further scrutinize the use of nanopore sequencing in the identification of single pathogens, including viruses (with a focus on its use in epidemiology, outbreak investigation, and viral resistance), bacteria (emphasizing 16S targeted sequencing, rare bacterial lung infections, and antimicrobial resistance studies), fungi (employing internal transcribed spacer sequencing), tuberculosis, and atypical pathogens. Furthermore, we discuss the role of nanopore sequencing in metagenomics and its potential for unbiased detection of all pathogens in a clinical setting, emphasizing its advantages in sequencing genome repeat areas and structural variant regions. We discuss the limitations in dealing with host DNA removal, the inherent high error rate of nanopore sequencing technology, along with the complexity of operation and processing, while acknowledging the possibilities provided by recent technological improvements. We compared nanopore sequencing with the BioFire system, a rapid molecular diagnostic system based on polymerase chain reaction. Although the BioFire system serves well for the rapid screening of known and common pathogens, it falls short in the identification of unknown or rare pathogens and in providing comprehensive genome analysis. As technological advancements continue, it is anticipated that the role of nanopore sequencing technology in diagnosing and treating lung infections will become increasingly significant.© 2023.

"37612597","Acute cigarette smoke exposure leads to higher viral infection in human bronchial epithelial cultures by altering interferon, glycolysis and GDF15-related pathways.","Respir Res","Acute exacerbations of chronic inflammatory lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), are frequently associated with rhinovirus (RV) infections. Despite these associations, the pathogenesis of virus-induced exacerbations is incompletely understood. We aimed to investigate effects of cigarette smoke (CS), a primary risk factor for COPD, on RV infection in airway epithelium and identify novel mechanisms related to these effects.Primary bronchial epithelial cells (PBEC) from COPD patients and controls were differentiated by culture at the air-liquid interface (ALI) and exposed to CS and RV-A16. Bulk RNA sequencing was performed using samples collected at 6 and 24 h post infection (hpi), and viral load, mediator and L-lactate levels were measured at 6, 24 and 48hpi. To further delineate the effect of CS on RV-A16 infection, we performed growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) knockdown, L-lactate and interferon pre-treatment in ALI-PBEC. We performed deconvolution analysis to predict changes in the cell composition of ALI-PBEC after the various exposures. Finally, we compared transcriptional responses of ALI-PBEC to those in nasal epithelium after human RV-A16 challenge.CS exposure impaired antiviral responses at 6hpi and increased viral replication at 24 and 48hpi in ALI-PBEC. At 24hpi, CS exposure enhanced expression of RV-A16-induced epithelial interferons, inflammation-related genes and CXCL8. CS exposure increased expression of oxidative stress-related genes, of GDF15, and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. GDF15 knockdown experiments suggested involvement of this pathway in the CS-induced increase in viral replication. Expression of glycolysis-related genes and L-lactate production were increased by CS exposure, and was demonstrated to contribute to higher viral replication. No major differences were demonstrated between COPD and non-COPD-derived cultures. However, cellular deconvolution analysis predicted higher secretory cells in COPD-derived cultures at baseline.Altogether, our findings demonstrate that CS exposure leads to higher viral infection in human bronchial epithelium by altering not only interferon responses, but likely also through a switch to glycolysis, and via GDF15-related pathways.© 2023.

"37546860",NA,NA,"Neurological impairment is the most common finding in patients with post-acute sequelae of COVID-19. Furthermore, survivors of pneumonia from any cause have an elevated risk of dementia1-4. Dysfunction in microglia, the primary immune cell in the brain, has been linked to cognitive impairment in murine models of dementia and in humans5. Here, we report a transcriptional response in human microglia collected from patients who died following COVID-19 suggestive of their activation by TNF-ɑ and other circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines. Consistent with these findings, the levels of 55 alveolar and plasma cytokines were elevated in a cohort of 341 patients with respiratory failure, including 93 unvaccinated patients with COVID-19 and 203 patients with other causes of pneumonia. While peak levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were similar in patients with pneumonia irrespective of etiology, cumulative cytokine exposure was higher in patients with COVID-19. Corticosteroid treatment, which has been shown to be beneficial in patients with COVID-196, was associated with lower levels of CXCL10, CCL8, and CCL2-molecules that sustain inflammatory circuits between alveolar macrophages harboring SARS-CoV-2 and activated T cells7. These findings suggest that corticosteroids may break this cycle and decrease systemic exposure to lung-derived cytokines and inflammatory activation of microglia in patients with COVID-19."
"37535681","Block Aligner: an adaptive SIMD-accelerated aligner for sequences and position-specific scoring matrices.","Bioinformatics","Efficiently aligning sequences is a fundamental problem in bioinformatics. Many recent algorithms for computing alignments through Smith-Waterman-Gotoh dynamic programming (DP) exploit Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) operations on modern CPUs for speed. However, these advances have largely ignored difficulties associated with efficiently handling complex scoring matrices or large gaps (insertions or deletions).We propose a new SIMD-accelerated algorithm called Block Aligner for aligning nucleotide and protein sequences against other sequences or position-specific scoring matrices. We introduce a new paradigm that uses blocks in the DP matrix that greedily shift, grow, and shrink. This approach allows regions of the DP matrix to be adaptively computed. Our algorithm reaches over 5-10 times faster than some previous methods while incurring an error rate of less than 3% on protein and long read datasets, despite large gaps and low sequence identities.Our algorithm is implemented for global, local, and X-drop alignments. It is available as a Rust library (with C bindings) at https://github.com/Daniel-Liu-c0deb0t/block-aligner.© The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press."
"37580899",NA,NA,"A number types of extracellular DNA (eg, cell-free, cfDNA) circulate in human blood, including mitochondrial, transcriptome, and regulatory DNA, usually at low concentrations. Larger amounts of cfDNA appear in any inflammatory condition, including organ damage due to a variety of reasons. The role of cfDNA in solid organ transplantation is discussed in this review as a valuable additional tool in the standard of care of transplant patients. Post-transplant monitoring requires the use of high-quality biomarkers for early detection of graft damage or rejection to be able to apply early therapeutic intervention. CfDNA complements the traditional monitoring strategies, being a risk stratification tool and an important prognostic marker. However, improving the sensitivity and specificity of cfDNA detection is necessary to facilitate personalized patient management, warranting further research in terms of measurement, test standardization, and storage, processing, and shipping. A diagnostic test (Allosure, CareDx, Inc., Brisbane, CA) for kidney, heart and lung transplant patients is now commercially available, and validation for other organs (eg, liver) is pending. To date, donor-derived cfDNA in combination with other biomarkers appears to be a promising tool in graft rejection as it is minimally invasive, time-sensitive, and cost-effective. However, improvement of sensitivity and specificity is required to facilitate personalized patient management. Whether it could be an alternate to graft biopsy remains unclear."

However, the era of population genomics presents new challenges in analysing the massive amounts of genomes and variants. Deep learning has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance for numerous applications involving large-scale data. Recently, deep learning approaches have gained popularity in population genetics; facilitated by the advent of massive genomic data sets, powerful computational hardware and complex deep learning architectures, they have been used to identify population structure, infer demographic history and investigate natural selection.

"37668698","Pilot study of relationship between prenatal stress during the COVID-19 pandemic and social-emotional development of 12-month-old children: the mediation effects of home environment.","Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry","There is increasing evidence that prenatal stress elevates the risk of children's social-emotional development, but the mechanisms underlying this association are unclear. Home environment provides learning opportunities and stimulation required for children's early development and can be influenced by prenatal maternal stress. This study aimed to examine whether home environment can mediate the association between prenatal stress during the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and their offspring's social-emotional problems thereafter. A pilot sample was derived from 2020 to 2021 Maternal and Child Health Cohort study (N = 82) with the pregnant women recruited during the COVID-19 lockdown period in 2020. Prenatal stress was assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale. Home environment was measured using the Child Home Nurture Environment Scales. Mother-reported toddler social-emotional problems were assessed at 12 months of age. The mediation model was used for data analysis. The mean scores of social-emotional problems, which include externalizing, internalizing, dysregulation, and competence, were 10.98 (5.08), 14.72 (6.49), 15.15 (6.31), and 36.73 (10.26), respectively. Prenatal stress, home environment, and social-emotional problems were significantly related (P < 0.05). Home environment significantly mediated the association between prenatal stress and social-emotional problems with the indirect effect [95% CI] of 0.06 [0.01, 0.14] for externalizing behaviors, 0.10 [0.00, 0.24] for internalizing behaviors, - 0.15 [- 0.31, - 0.01] for competence, 0.08 [0.01, 0.17] and 0.08 [0.01, 0.21] for dysregulation. These findings suggest that prenatal stress may affect offspring's social-emotional problems through the home environment. Screening for prenatal stress and promoting supportive home environment may be potential strategies for social-emotional problems interventions in children.© 2023.

The advent of single-cell sequencing has greatly increased our knowledge of the cell types present in the tumor microenvironment and their role in the developing cancer. This, coupled with clinical data showing that cancer development and the response to therapy may be influenced by drugs that indirectly influence the tumor environment, highlights the need to better understand how the cells present in the TME work together. This review looks at the different cell types (cancer cells, cancer stem cells, endothelial cells, pericytes, adipose cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts, and neuronal cells) in the bladder tumor microenvironment. Their impact on immune activation and on shaping the microenvironment are discussed as well as the effects of hypertensive drugs and anesthetics on bladder cancer."
