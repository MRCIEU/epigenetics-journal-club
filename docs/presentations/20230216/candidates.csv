x,36782224,DNA methylation in peripheral blood leukocytes for the association with glucose metabolism and invasive breast cancer.,Clin Epigenetics,"Insulin resistance (IR) is a well-established factor for breast cancer (BC) risk in postmenopausal women, but the interrelated molecular pathways on the methylome are not explicitly described. We conducted a population-level epigenome-wide association (EWA) study for DNA methylation (DNAm) probes that are associated with IR and prospectively correlated with BC development, both overall and in BC subtypes among postmenopausal women.We used data from Women's Health Initiative (WHI) ancillary studies for our EWA analyses and evaluated the associations of site-specific DNAm across the genome with IR phenotypes by multiple regressions adjusting for age and leukocyte heterogeneities. For our analysis of the top 20 IR-CpGs with BC risk, we used the WHI and the Cancer Genomic Atlas (TCGA), using multiple Cox proportional hazards and logit regressions, respectively, accounting for age, diabetes, obesity, leukocyte heterogeneities, and tumor purity (for TCGA). We further conducted a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis.We detected several EWA-CpGs in TXNIP, CPT1A, PHGDH, and ABCG1. In particular, cg19693031 in TXNIP was replicated in all IR phenotypes, measured by fasting levels of glucose, insulin, and homeostatic model assessment-IR. Of those replicated IR-genes, 3 genes (CPT1A, PHGDH, and ABCG1) were further correlated with BC risk; and 1 individual CpG (cg01676795 in POR) was commonly detected across the 2 cohorts.Our study contributes to better understanding of the interconnected molecular pathways on the methylome between IR and BC carcinogenesis and suggests potential use of DNAm markers in the peripheral blood cells as preventive targets to detect an at-risk group for IR and BC in postmenopausal women.© 2023.

x,36778507,A Higher Dysregulation Burden of Brain DNA Methylation in Female Patients Implicated in the Sex Bias of Schizophrenia.,Res Sq,"Sex differences are pervasive in schizophrenia (SCZ), but the extent and magnitude of DNA methylation (DNAm) changes underlying these differences remain uncharacterized. In this study, sex-stratified differential DNAm analysis was performed in postmortem brain samples from 117 SCZ and 137 controls, partitioned into discovery and replication datasets. Three differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were identified (adj.p < 0.05) in females and 29 DMPs in males without overlap between them. Over 81% of these sex-stratified DMPs were directionally consistent between sexes but with different effect sizes. Down-sampling analysis revealed more DMPs in females than in males when the sample sizes matched. Females had higher DNAm levels in healthy individuals and larger magnitude of DNAm changes in patients than males. Despite similar proportions of female-related DMPs (fDMPs, 8%) being under genetic control compared with males (10%), significant enrichment of DMP-related SNPs in signals of genome-wide association studies was identified only in fDMPs. One DMP in each sex connected the SNPs and gene expression ofCALHM1in females andCCDC149in males. PPI subnetworks revealed that both female- and male-related differential DNAm interacted with synapse-related dysregulation. Immune-related pathways were unique for females and neuron-related pathways were associated with males. This study reveals remarkable quantitative differences in DNAm-related sexual dimorphism in SCZ and that females have a higher dysregulation burden of SCZ-associated DNAm than males."
x,36765422,Parity is associated with long-term differences in DNA methylation at genes related to neural plasticity in multiple sclerosis.,Clin Epigenetics,"Pregnancy in women with multiple sclerosis (wwMS) is associated with a reduction of long-term disability progression. The mechanism that drives this effect is unknown, but converging evidence suggests a role for epigenetic mechanisms altering immune and/or central nervous system function. In this study, we aimed to identify whole blood and immune cell-specific DNA methylation patterns associated with parity in relapse-onset MS.We investigated the association between whole blood and immune cell-type-specific genome-wide methylation patterns and parity in 192 women with relapse-onset MS, matched for age and disease severity. The median time from last pregnancy to blood collection was 16.7 years (range = 1.5-44.4 years). We identified 2965 differentially methylated positions in whole blood, 68.5% of which were hypermethylated in parous women; together with two differentially methylated regions on Chromosomes 17 and 19 which mapped to TMC8 and ZNF577, respectively. Our findings validated 22 DMPs and 366 differentially methylated genes from existing literature on epigenetic changes associated with parity in wwMS. Differentially methylated genes in whole blood were enriched in neuronal structure and growth-related pathways. Immune cell-type-specific analysis using cell-type proportion estimates from statistical deconvolution of whole blood revealed further differential methylation in T cells specifically (four in CD4+and eight in CD8+T cells). We further identified reduced methylation age acceleration in parous women, demonstrating slower biological aging compared to nulligravida women.Differential methylation at genes related to neural plasticity offers a potential molecular mechanism driving the long-term effect of pregnancy on MS outcomes. Our results point to a potential 'CNS signature' of methylation in peripheral immune cells, as previously described in relation to MS progression, induced by parity. As the first epigenome-wide association study of parity in wwMS reported, validation studies are needed to confirm our findings.© 2023. The Author(s)."
ryan,36758479,UCseek: ultrasensitive early detection and recurrence monitoring of urothelial carcinoma by shallow-depth genome-wide bisulfite sequencing of urinary sediment DNA.,EBioMedicine,"Current methods for the detection and surveillance of urothelial carcinomas (UCs) are often invasive, costly, and not effective for low-grade, early-stage, and minimal residual disease (MRD) tumors. We aimed to develop and validate a model from urine sediments to predict different grade and stage UCs with low cost and high accuracy.We collected 167 samples, including 90 tumors and 77 individuals without tumors, as a discovery cohort. We assessed copy number variations and methylation values for them and constructed a diagnostic classifier to detect UC, UCseek, by using an individual read-based method and support vector machine. The performance of UCseek was validated in an independent cohort derived from three hospitals (n = 206) and a relapse cohort (n = 42) for monitoring recurrence.We constructed UCseek, which could predict UCs with high sensitivity (92.7%), high specificity (90.7%), and high accuracy (91.7%) in the independent validation set. The accuracy of UCseek in low-grade and early-stage patients reached 91.8% and 94.3%, respectively. Notably, UCseek retained great performance at ultralow sequencing depths (0.3X-0.5X). It also demonstrated a powerful ability to monitor recurrence in a surveillance cohort compared with cystoscopy (90.91% vs. 59.09%).We optimized an improved approach named UCseek for the noninvasive diagnosis and monitoring of UCs in both low- and high-grade tumors and in early- and advanced-stage tumors, even at ultralow sequencing depths, which may reduce the burden of cystoscopy and blind second surgery.A full list of funding bodies that contributed to this study can be found in the Acknowledgments section.Copyright © 2023.

neil,36752523,Circulating triglycerides are associated with human adipose tissue DNA methylation of genes linked to metabolic disease.,Hum Mol Genet,"Dysregulation of circulating lipids is a central element for the metabolic syndrome. However, it is not well established whether human subcutaneous adipose tissue is affected by or affect circulating lipids through epigenetic mechanisms. Hence, our aim was to investigate the association between circulating lipids and DNA methylation levels in human adipose tissue.DNA methylation and gene expression were analyzed genome-wide in subcutaneous adipose tissue from two different cohorts, including 85 men and 93 women, respectively. Associations between DNA methylation and circulating levels of triglycerides, LDL, HDL and total cholesterol were analysed. Causal mediation analyses tested if adipose tissue DNA methylation mediates the effects of triglycerides on gene expression or insulin resistance.We found 115 novel associations between triglycerides and adipose tissue DNA methylation, e.g. in the promoter of RFS1, ARID2, and HOXA5 in the male cohort (p ≤ 1.1x10-7), and 63 associations e.g. within the gene body of PTPRN2 and COL6A3 in the female cohort. We further connected these findings to altered mRNA expression levels in adipose tissue (e.g. HOXA5, IL11 and FAM45B). Interestingly, there was no overlap between methylation sites associated with triglycerides in men and the sites found in women, which points towards sex-specific effects of triglycerides on the epigenome. Finally, a causal mediation analysis provided support for adipose tissue DNA methylation as a partial mediating factor between circulating triglycerides and insulin resistance.This study identified novel epigenetic alterations in adipose tissue associated with circulating lipids. Identified epigenetic changes seem to mediate effects of triglycerides on insulin resistance.© The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

x,36754048,Transgenerational inheritance of acquired epigenetic signatures at CpG islands in mice,Cell,"Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in mammals remains a debated subject. Here, we demonstrate that DNA methylation of promoter-associated CpG islands (CGIs) can be transmitted from parents to their offspring in mice. We generated DNA methylation-edited mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), in which CGIs of two metabolism-related genes, the Ankyrin repeat domain 26 and the low-density lipoprotein receptor, were specifically methylated and silenced. DNA methylation-edited mice generated by microinjection of the methylated ESCs exhibited abnormal metabolic phenotypes. Acquired methylation of the targeted CGI and the phenotypic traits were maintained and transmitted across multiple generations. The heritable CGI methylation was subjected to reprogramming in parental PGCs and subsequently reestablished in the next generation at post-implantation stages. These observations provide a concrete step toward demonstrating transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in mammals, which may have implications in our understanding of evolutionary biology as well as the etiology, diagnosis, and prevention of non-genetically inherited human diseases."
