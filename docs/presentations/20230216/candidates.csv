"36786322","DNA-methylation and immunological response in medication overuse headache.","Cephalalgia","To investigate whether medication-overuse headache patients have differential DNA-methylation pattern.We collected blood samples from 120 medication-overuse headache-patients, 57 controls (29 episodic migraine patients and 28 healthy controls) in a hypothesis-generating cross-sectional case-control pilot study; 100 of the medication-overuse headache-patients were followed for six months and samples were collected at two and six months for the longitudinal methylation analyses. Blood cell proportions of leucocytes (neutrophils, NK-cells, monocytes, CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells, and B-cells) and the neutrophile-lymphocyte ratio were estimated using methylation data as a measure for immunological analysis and a cell type-specific epigenome wide association study was conducted between medication-overuse headache-patients and controls, and longitudinally for reduction in headache days/month among medication-overuse headache-patients.We found a higher neutrophile-lymphocyte ratio in medication-overuse headache-patients compared to controls, indicating a higher immunological response in medication-overuse headache-patients (false discovery rate (adjusted p-value)<0.001). Reduction in headache days/month (9.8; 95% CI 8.1-11.5) was associated with lower neutrophile-lymphocyte ratio (false discovery rate adjusted p-value = 0.041).Three genes (CORIN, CCKBRandCLDN9) were hypermethylated in specific cell types in medication-overuse headache-patients compared to controls. No methylation differences were associated with reduction in headache days in medication-overuse headache-patients after six months.This pilot study was consistent with higher immunological response in medication-overuse headache-patients which decreased with a reduction in headache days in longitudinal analysis. medication-overuse headache-patients exhibited differential methylation in innate immune cells but did not exhibit longitudinal differences with alterations in headache days. Our study creates hypotheses for further biomarker searches.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:NCT02993289."
"36782243","Epigenome-wide analysis of aging effects on liver regeneration.","BMC Biol","Aging is known to exert an effect on liver regeneration, with the ability of liver to regenerate displaying a significant decline over time. Liver physiological parameters such as liver volume, blood flow, and metabolism, as well as the ability to regenerate after injury have all been shown to decrease at old age in humans and model systems, with a number of molecular mechanisms proposed to be involved, including DNA methylation-dependent genome remodeling. To address how changes in DNA methylation mediate the adverse aging effect on liver regeneration, we searched for differentially methylated genomic regions (DMRs) in mouse livers co-regulated by aging and regeneration and determined their associated genes and enriched pathways.DMRs were identified using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS). Pathway analysis of aging DMR-mapped genes revealed two distinct phases of aging, 2-to-8 and 8-to-16 months old (m/o). Regenerative DMR-mapped differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were enriched in pathways controlling cell proliferation and differentiation. Most DMRs shared by both aging and regeneration changed in the same methylation direction between 2 and 8 m/o but in the opposite direction between 8 and 16 m/o. Regenerative DMRs inversely affected by aging during 8-to-16 m/o were found in the promoter/gene regions of 12 genes. Four regenerative DEGs were synchronously regulated by early aging and inversely regulated by mid-to-late aging DMRs. Lead DMR-mapped genes were validated by their expression profiles in liver aging and regeneration.Our study has uncovered new DMRs and gene targets inversely affected by liver aging and regeneration to explain the adverse aging effect on liver regeneration. These findings will be of fundamental importance to understand the epigenomic changes underlying the biology of aging on liver regeneration.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36782224","DNA methylation in peripheral blood leukocytes for the association with glucose metabolism and invasive breast cancer.","Clin Epigenetics","Insulin resistance (IR) is a well-established factor for breast cancer (BC) risk in postmenopausal women, but the interrelated molecular pathways on the methylome are not explicitly described. We conducted a population-level epigenome-wide association (EWA) study for DNA methylation (DNAm) probes that are associated with IR and prospectively correlated with BC development, both overall and in BC subtypes among postmenopausal women.We used data from Women's Health Initiative (WHI) ancillary studies for our EWA analyses and evaluated the associations of site-specific DNAm across the genome with IR phenotypes by multiple regressions adjusting for age and leukocyte heterogeneities. For our analysis of the top 20 IR-CpGs with BC risk, we used the WHI and the Cancer Genomic Atlas (TCGA), using multiple Cox proportional hazards and logit regressions, respectively, accounting for age, diabetes, obesity, leukocyte heterogeneities, and tumor purity (for TCGA). We further conducted a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis.We detected several EWA-CpGs in TXNIP, CPT1A, PHGDH, and ABCG1. In particular, cg19693031 in TXNIP was replicated in all IR phenotypes, measured by fasting levels of glucose, insulin, and homeostatic model assessment-IR. Of those replicated IR-genes, 3 genes (CPT1A, PHGDH, and ABCG1) were further correlated with BC risk; and 1 individual CpG (cg01676795 in POR) was commonly detected across the 2 cohorts.Our study contributes to better understanding of the interconnected molecular pathways on the methylome between IR and BC carcinogenesis and suggests potential use of DNAm markers in the peripheral blood cells as preventive targets to detect an at-risk group for IR and BC in postmenopausal women.© 2023.

"36778507","A Higher Dysregulation Burden of Brain DNA Methylation in Female Patients Implicated in the Sex Bias of Schizophrenia.","Res Sq","Sex differences are pervasive in schizophrenia (SCZ), but the extent and magnitude of DNA methylation (DNAm) changes underlying these differences remain uncharacterized. In this study, sex-stratified differential DNAm analysis was performed in postmortem brain samples from 117 SCZ and 137 controls, partitioned into discovery and replication datasets. Three differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were identified (adj.p < 0.05) in females and 29 DMPs in males without overlap between them. Over 81% of these sex-stratified DMPs were directionally consistent between sexes but with different effect sizes. Down-sampling analysis revealed more DMPs in females than in males when the sample sizes matched. Females had higher DNAm levels in healthy individuals and larger magnitude of DNAm changes in patients than males. Despite similar proportions of female-related DMPs (fDMPs, 8%) being under genetic control compared with males (10%), significant enrichment of DMP-related SNPs in signals of genome-wide association studies was identified only in fDMPs. One DMP in each sex connected the SNPs and gene expression ofCALHM1in females andCCDC149in males. PPI subnetworks revealed that both female- and male-related differential DNAm interacted with synapse-related dysregulation. Immune-related pathways were unique for females and neuron-related pathways were associated with males. This study reveals remarkable quantitative differences in DNAm-related sexual dimorphism in SCZ and that females have a higher dysregulation burden of SCZ-associated DNAm than males."
"36778111","Acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC mediates epigenetic downregulation of MUC17 by facilitating NF-ÎºB activity via UHRF1/DNMT1 complex.","Int J Biol Sci","Treatment with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has brought significant benefits to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with EGFR mutations. However, most patients eventually develop acquired resistance after treatment. This study investigated the epigenetic effects of mucin 17 (MUC17) in acquired drug-resistant cells of EGFR-TKIs. We found that GR/OR (gefitinib/osimertinib-resistance) cells enhance genome-wide DNA hypermethylation, mainly in 5-UTR associated with multiple oncogenic pathways, in which GR/OR cells exerted a pro-oncogenic effect by downregulating mucin 17 (MUC17) expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Gefitinib/osimertinib acquired resistance mediated down-regulation of MUC17 by promoting DNMT1/UHRF1 complex-dependent promoter methylation, thereby activating NF-κB activity. MUC17 increased the generation of IκB-α and inhibit NF-κB activity by promoting the expression of MZF1.In vivoresults also showed that DNMT1 inhibitor (5-Aza) in combination with gefitinib/osimertinib restored sensitivity to OR/GR cells. Acquired drug resistance of gefitinib/osimertinib promoted UHRF1/DNMT1 complex to inhibit the expression of MUC17. MUC17 in GR/OR cells may act as an epigenetic sensor for biomonitoring the resistance to EGFR-TKIs.© The author(s)."
"36774548","A bacteriocyte symbiont determines whitefly sex ratio by regulating mitochondrial function.","Cell Rep","Nutritional symbionts influence host reproduction, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unclear. We previously found that the bacteriocyte symbiont Hamiltonella impacts the sex ratio of the whitefly Bemisia tabaci. Hamiltonella synthesizes folate by cooperation with the whitefly. Folate deficiency by Hamiltonella elimination or whitefly gene silencing distorted whitefly sex ratio, and folate supplementation restored the sex ratio. Hamiltonella deficiency or gene silencing altered histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) level, which was restored by folate supplementation. Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation-seq analysis of H3K9me3 indicated mitochondrial dysfunction in symbiont-deficient whiteflies. Hamiltonella deficiency compromised mitochondrial quality of whitefly ovaries. Repressing ovary mitochondrial function led to distorted whitefly sex ratio. These findings indicate that the symbiont-derived folate regulates host histone methylation modifications, which thereby impacts ovary mitochondrial function, and finally determines host sex ratio. Our study suggests that a nutritional symbiont can regulate animal reproduction in a way that differs from reproductive manipulators.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

"36773096","DNA methylation changes and increased mRNA expression of coagulation proteins, factor V and thrombomodulin in Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy.","Cell Mol Life Sci","Late-onset Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is a disease affecting the corneal endothelium (CE), associated with a cytosine-thymine-guanine repeat expansion at the CTG18.1 locus in the transcription factor 4 (TCF4) gene. It is unknown whether CTG18.1 expansions affect global methylation including TCF4 gene in CE or whether global CE methylation changes at advanced age. Using genome-wide DNA methylation array, we investigated methylation in CE from FECD patients with CTG18.1 expansions and studied the methylation in healthy CE at different ages. The most revealing DNA methylation findings were analyzed by gene expression and protein analysis. 3488 CpGs had significantly altered methylation pattern in FECD though no substantial changes were found in TCF4. The most hypermethylated site was in a predicted promoter of aquaporin 1 (AQP1) gene, and the most hypomethylated site was in a predicted promoter of coagulation factor V (F5 for gene, FV for protein). In FECD, AQP1 mRNA expression was variable, while F5 gene expression showed a ~ 23-fold increase. FV protein was present in both healthy and affected CE. Further gene expression analysis of coagulation factors interacting with FV revealed a ~ 34-fold increase of thrombomodulin (THBD). THBD protein was detected only in CE from FECD patients. Additionally, we observed an age-dependent hypomethylation in elderly healthy CE.Thus, tissue-specific genome-wide and gene-specific methylation changes associated with altered gene expression were discovered in FECD. TCF4 pathological methylation in FECD because of CTG18.1 expansion was ruled out.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36769164","Epigenetic Regulation of Corneal Epithelial Differentiation by TET2.","Int J Mol Sci","Epigenetic DNA modification by 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), generated by the Ten-eleven translocation (TET) dioxygenases, regulates diverse biological functions in many organ tissues, including the mammalian eye. For example, 5hmC has been shown to be involved in epigenetic regulation of retinal gene expression. However, a functional role of 5hmC in corneal differentiation has not been investigated to date. Here, we examined 5hmC and TET function in the human cornea. We found 5hmC highly expressed in MUC16-positive terminally differentiated cells that also co-expressed the 5hmC-generating enzyme TET2.TET2knockdown (KD) in cultured corneal epithelial cells led to significant reductions of 5hmC peak distributions and resulted in transcriptional repression of molecular pathways involved in corneal differentiation, as evidenced by downregulation of MUC4, MUC16, and Keratin 12. Additionally, integratedTET2KD RNA-seq and genome-wide Reduced Representation Hydroxymethylation Profiling revealed novel epigenetically regulated genes expressed by terminally differentiated cells, includingKRT78,MYEOV, andMAL. In aggregate, our findings reveal a novel function of TET2 in the epigenetic regulation of corneal epithelial gene expression and identify novel TET2-controlled genes expressed in differentiated corneal epithelial cells. These results point to potential roles for TET2 induction strategies to enhance treatment of corneal diseases associated with abnormal epithelial maturation."
"36768894","Dissecting the Complexity of Skeletal-Malocclusion-Associated Phenotypes: Mouse for the Rescue.","Int J Mol Sci","Skeletal deformities and malocclusions being heterogeneous traits, affect populations worldwide, resulting in compromised esthetics and function and reduced quality of life. Skeletal Class III prevalence is the least common of all angle malocclusion classes, with a frequency of 7.2%, while Class II prevalence is approximately 27% on average, varying in different countries and between ethnic groups. Orthodontic malocclusions and skeletal deformities have multiple etiologies, often affected and underlined by environmental, genetic and social aspects. Here, we have conducted a comprehensive search throughout the published data until the time of writing this review for already reported quantitative trait loci (QTL) and genes associated with the development of skeletal deformation-associated phenotypes in different mouse models. Our search has found 72 significant QTL associated with the size of the mandible, the character, shape, centroid size and facial shape in mouse models. We propose that using the collaborative cross (CC), a highly diverse mouse reference genetic population, may offer a novel venue for identifying genetic factors as a cause for skeletal deformations, which may help to better understand Class III malocclusion-associated phenotype development in mice, which can be subsequently translated to humans. We suggest that by performing a genome-wide association study (GWAS), an epigenetics-wide association study (EWAS), RNAseq analysis, integrating GWAS and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), micro and small RNA, and long noncoding RNA analysis in tissues associated with skeletal deformation and Class III malocclusion characterization/phenotypes, including mandibular basic bone, gum, and jaw, in the CC mouse population, we expect to better identify genetic factors and better understand the development of this disease."
"36768187","Unravelling Differential DNA Methylation Patterns in Genotype Dependent Manner under Salinity Stress Response in Chickpea.","Int J Mol Sci","DNA methylation is one of the epigenetic mechanisms that govern gene regulation in response to abiotic stress in plants. Here, we analyzed the role of epigenetic variations by exploring global DNA methylation and integrating it with differential gene expression in response to salinity stress in tolerant and sensitive chickpea genotypes. Genome-wide DNA methylation profiles showed higher CG methylation in the gene body regions and higher CHH methylation in the TE body regions. The analysis of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) suggested more hyper-methylation in response to stress in the tolerant genotype compared to the sensitive genotype. We observed higher enrichment of CG DMRs in genes and CHH DMRs in transposable elements (TEs). A positive correlation of gene expression with CG gene body methylation was observed. The enrichment analysis of DMR-associated differentially expressed genes revealed they are involved in biological processes, such as lateral root development, transmembrane transporter activity, GTPase activity, and regulation of gene expression. Further, a high correlation of CG methylation with CHG and CHH methylation under salinity stress was revealed, suggesting crosstalk among the methylation contexts. Further, we observed small RNA-mediated CHH hypermethylation in TEs. Overall, the interplay between DNA methylation, small RNAs, and gene expression provides new insights into the regulatory mechanism underlying salinity stress response in chickpeas."
"36766691","Increased Methylation of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) Is Related to Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder and Severity of Suicide Attempt in Women.","Cells","Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has previously been associated with the pathogenesis of both emotionally unstable personality disorder (EUPD) and suicidal behavior. No study has yet investigatedBDNF-associated epigenetic alterations in a group of severely impaired EUPD and suicidal patients. The discovery cohort consisted of 97 women with emotionally unstable personality disorder (EUPD) with at least two serious suicide attempts (SAs) and 32 healthy female controls. The genome-wide methylation pattern was measured by the Illumina EPIC BeadChip and analyzed by robust linear regression models to investigate meanBDNFmethylation levels in a targeted analysis conditioned upon severity of suicide attempt. The validation cohort encompassed 60 female suicide attempters, stratified into low- (n = 45) and high-risk groups (n = 15) based on degree of intent-to-die and lethality of SA method, and occurrence of death-by-suicide at follow-up. MeanBDNFmethylation levels exhibited increased methylation in relation to EUPD (p= 0.0159, percentage mean group difference ~3.8%). Similarly, this locus was confirmed as higher-methylated in an independent cohort of females with severe suicidal behavior (p= 0.0300). Results were independent of age and BMI. This is the first study to reveal emerging evidence of epigenetic dysregulation ofBDNFwith dependence on features known to confer increased risk of suicide deaths (lethality of suicide-attempt method and presence of EUPD diagnosis with history of recent SAs). Further studies investigating epigenetic and genetic effects ofBDNFon severe suicidal behavior and EUPD are needed to further elucidate the role of epigenetic regulatory mechanisms and neurotrophic factors in relation to suicide and EUPD, and hold potential to result in novel treatment methods."
"36766442","Recent Updates on Corticosteroid-Induced Neuropsychiatric Disorders and Theranostic Advancements through Gene Editing Tools.","Diagnostics (Basel)","The vast use of corticosteroids (CCSs) globally has led to an increase in CCS-induced neuropsychiatric disorders (NPDs), a very common manifestation in patients after CCS consumption. These neuropsychiatric disorders range from depression, insomnia, and bipolar disorders to panic attacks, overt psychosis, and many other cognitive changes in such subjects. Though their therapeutic importance in treating and improving many clinical symptoms overrides the complications that arise after their consumption, still, there has been an alarming rise in NPD cases in recent years, and they are seen as the greatest public health challenge globally; therefore, these potential side effects cannot be ignored. It has also been observed that many of the neuronal functional activities are regulated and controlled by genomic variants with epigenetic factors (DNA methylation, non-coding RNA, and histone modeling, etc.), and any alterations in these regulatory mechanisms affect normal cerebral development and functioning. This study explores a general overview of emerging concerns of CCS-induced NPDs, the effective molecular biology approaches that can revitalize NPD therapy in an extremely specialized, reliable, and effective manner, and the possible gene-editing-based therapeutic strategies to either prevent or cure NPDs in the future."
"36765422","Parity is associated with long-term differences in DNA methylation at genes related to neural plasticity in multiple sclerosis.","Clin Epigenetics","Pregnancy in women with multiple sclerosis (wwMS) is associated with a reduction of long-term disability progression. The mechanism that drives this effect is unknown, but converging evidence suggests a role for epigenetic mechanisms altering immune and/or central nervous system function. In this study, we aimed to identify whole blood and immune cell-specific DNA methylation patterns associated with parity in relapse-onset MS.We investigated the association between whole blood and immune cell-type-specific genome-wide methylation patterns and parity in 192 women with relapse-onset MS, matched for age and disease severity. The median time from last pregnancy to blood collection was 16.7 years (range = 1.5-44.4 years). We identified 2965 differentially methylated positions in whole blood, 68.5% of which were hypermethylated in parous women; together with two differentially methylated regions on Chromosomes 17 and 19 which mapped to TMC8 and ZNF577, respectively. Our findings validated 22 DMPs and 366 differentially methylated genes from existing literature on epigenetic changes associated with parity in wwMS. Differentially methylated genes in whole blood were enriched in neuronal structure and growth-related pathways. Immune cell-type-specific analysis using cell-type proportion estimates from statistical deconvolution of whole blood revealed further differential methylation in T cells specifically (four in CD4+and eight in CD8+T cells). We further identified reduced methylation age acceleration in parous women, demonstrating slower biological aging compared to nulligravida women.Differential methylation at genes related to neural plasticity offers a potential molecular mechanism driving the long-term effect of pregnancy on MS outcomes. Our results point to a potential 'CNS signature' of methylation in peripheral immune cells, as previously described in relation to MS progression, induced by parity. As the first epigenome-wide association study of parity in wwMS reported, validation studies are needed to confirm our findings.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36765383","Liver saturated fat content associates with hepatic DNA methylation in obese individuals.","Clin Epigenetics","Accumulation of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) in the liver is known to induce hepatic steatosis and inflammation causing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Although SFAs have been shown to affect the epigenome in whole blood, pancreatic islets, and adipose tissue in humans, and genome-wide DNA methylation studies have linked epigenetic changes to NAFLD and NASH, studies focusing on the association of SFAs and DNA methylation in human liver are missing. We, therefore, investigated whether human liver SFA content associates with DNA methylation and tested if SFA-linked alterations in DNA methylation associate with NAFLD-related clinical phenotypes in obese individuals.We identified DNA methylation (Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip) of 3169 CpGs to be associated with liver total SFA content (q-value < 0.05) measured using proton NMR spectroscopy in participants of the Kuopio Obesity Surgery Study (n = 51; mean ± SD:49.3 ± 8.5 years old; BMI:43.7 ± 6.2 kg/m2). Of these 3169 sites, 797 overlapped with previously published NASH-associated CpGs (NASH-SFA), while 2372 CpGs were exclusively associated with SFA (Only-SFA). The corresponding annotated genes of these only-SFA CpGs were found to be enriched in pathways linked to satiety and hunger. Among the 54 genes mapping to these enriched pathways, DNA methylation of CpGs mapping to PRKCA and TSPO correlated with their own mRNA expression (HumanHT-12 Expression BeadChip). In addition, DNA methylation of another ten of these CpGs correlated with the mRNA expression of their neighboring genes (p value < 0.05). The proportion of CpGs demonstrating a correlation of DNA methylation with plasma glucose was higher in NASH-SFA and only-SFA groups, while the proportion of significant correlations with plasma insulin was higher in only-NASH and NASH-SFA groups as compared to all CpGs on the Illumina 450 K array (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).Our results suggest that one of the mechanisms how SFA could contribute to metabolic dysregulation in NAFLD is at the level of DNA methylation. We further propose that liver SFA-related DNA methylation profile may contribute more to hyperglycemia, while insulin-related methylation profile is more linked to NAFLD or NASH. Further research is needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms behind these observations.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Epigenetic research investigating CM has focused on differential DNA methylation (DNAm) in genes associated with the stress response, but there has been limited evaluation of the specific effects of subtypes of CM. This systematic review of literature investigating DNAm associated with CM in non-clinical populations aimed to summarise the approaches currently used in research, how the type of maltreatment and age of exposure were encoded via methylation, and which genes have consistently been associated with CM. A total of fifty-four papers were eligible for review, including forty-one candidate gene studies, eight epigenome-wide association studies, and five studies with a mixed design. The ways in which the various forms of CM were conceptualised and measured varied between papers. Future studies would benefit from assessments that employ conceptually robust definitions of CM, and that capture important contextual information such as age of exposure and subtype of CM.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

Delineating the exact epigenetic and gene-expression alterations in EMT-associated EGFR TKI-resistance (EMT-E-TKI-R) is vital for improved diagnosis and treatment of NSCLC patients.We characterized genome-wide changes in mRNA-expression, DNA-methylation and the histone-modification H3K36me3 inEGFR-mutated NSCLC HCC827 cells in result of acquired EMT-E-TKI-R. CRISPR/Cas9 was used to functional examine key findings from the omics analyses.Acquired EMT-E-TKI-R was analyzed with three omics approaches. RNA-sequencing identified 2,233 and 1,972 up- and down-regulated genes, respectively, and among these were established EMT-markers. DNA-methylation EPIC array analyses identified 14,163 and 7,999 hyper- and hypo-methylated, respectively, differential methylated positions of which several were present in EMT-markers. Finally, H3K36me3 chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-sequencing detected 2,873 and 3,836 genes with enrichment and depletion, respectively, and among these were established EMT-markers. Correlation analyses showed that EMT-E-TKI-R mRNA-expression changes correlated better with H3K36me3 changes than with DNA-methylation changes. Moreover, the omics data supported the involvement of theMIR141/MIR200C-ZEB1/ZEB2-FGFR1 signaling axis for acquired EMT-E-TKI-R. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated analyses corroborated the importance of ZEB1 in acquired EMT-E-TKI-R,MIR200CandMIR141to be in an EMT-E-TKI-R-associated auto-regulatory loop with ZEB1, and FGFR1 to mediate cell survival in EMT-E-TKI-R.The current study describes the synchronous genome-wide changes in mRNA-expression, DNA-methylation, and H3K36me3 in NSCLC EMT-E-TKI-R. The omics approaches revealed potential novel diagnostic markers and treatment targets.

"36760028","Epigenomic variability is associated with age-specific naÃ¯ve CD4 T cell response to activation in infants and adolescents.","Immunol Cell Biol","Childhood is a critical period of immune development. During this time, naïve CD4 (nCD4) T cells undergo programmed cell differentiation, mediated by epigenetic changes, in response to external stimuli leading to a baseline homeostatic state that may determine lifelong disease risk. However, the ontogeny of epigenetic signatures associated with CD4 T cell activation during key developmental periods are yet to be described. We investigated genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) changes associated with nCD4 T activation following 72-hour culture in media+anti-CD3/CD28 beads in healthy infants (aged 12 months, n = 18) and adolescents (aged 10-15 years, n = 15). We integrated this data with transcriptomic and cytokine profiling from the same samples. nCD4 T cells from both age groups show similar extensive epigenetic reprogramming following activation, with the majority of genes involved in the T cell receptor signalling pathway associated with differential methylation. Additionally, we identified differentially methylated probes showing age-specific responses, that is, responses in only infants or adolescents, including within a cluster of T cell receptor (TCR) genes. These encoded several TCR alpha joining (TRAJ), and TCR alpha variable (TRAV) genes. Cytokine data analysis following stimulation revealed enhanced release of IFN-γ, IL-2 and IL-10, in nCD4 T cells from adolescents compared to infants. Overlapping differential methylation and cytokine responses identified four probes potentially underpinning these age-specific responses. We show that DNAm in nCD4T cells in response to activation is dynamic in infancy and adolescence, with additional evidence for age-specific effects potentially driving variation in cytokine responses between these ages.This article is protected by copyright.

Prophylactic treatments for migraine, such as topiramate or valproate, reduce the number of cortical spreading depression events in rodents.To investigate whether cortical spreading depolarization with and without chronic treatment with topiramate or valproate affect the DNA methylation of the cortex.Sprague-Dawley rats were intraperitoneally injected with saline, topiramate or valproate for four weeks when cortical spreading depolarization were induced and genome-wide DNA methylation was performed in the cortex of six rats per group.The DNA methylation profile of the cortex was significantly modified after cortical spreading depolarization, with and without topiramate or valproate. Interestingly, topiramate reduced by almost 50% the number of differentially methylated regions, whereas valproate increased them by 17%, when comparing to the non-treated group after cortical spreading depolarization induction. The majority of the differentially methylated regions lay within intragenic regions, and the analyses of functional group over-representation retrieved several enriched functions, including functions related to protein processing in the cortical spreading depolarization without treatment group; functions related to metabolic processes in the cortical spreading depolarization with topiramate group; and functions related to synapse and ErbB, MAPK or retrograde endocannabinoid signaling in the cortical spreading depolarization with valproate group.Our results may provide insights into the underlying physiological mechanisms of migraine with aura and emphasize the role of epigenetics in migraine susceptibility."

We aimed to develop and validate a model from urine sediments to predict different grade and stage UCs with low cost and high accuracy.We collected 167 samples, including 90 tumors and 77 individuals without tumors, as a discovery cohort. We assessed copy number variations and methylation values for them and constructed a diagnostic classifier to detect UC, UCseek, by using an individual read-based method and support vector machine. The performance of UCseek was validated in an independent cohort derived from three hospitals (n = 206) and a relapse cohort (n = 42) for monitoring recurrence.We constructed UCseek, which could predict UCs with high sensitivity (92.7%), high specificity (90.7%), and high accuracy (91.7%) in the independent validation set. The accuracy of UCseek in low-grade and early-stage patients reached 91.8% and 94.3%, respectively. Notably, UCseek retained great performance at ultralow sequencing depths (0.3X-0.5X). It also demonstrated a powerful ability to monitor recurrence in a surveillance cohort compared with cystoscopy (90.91% vs. 59.09%).We optimized an improved approach named UCseek for the noninvasive diagnosis and monitoring of UCs in both low- and high-grade tumors and in early- and advanced-stage tumors, even at ultralow sequencing depths, which may reduce the burden of cystoscopy and blind second surgery.A full list of funding bodies that contributed to this study can be found in the Acknowledgments section.Copyright © 2023.

Defective ureteric bud morphogenesis could give rise to a spectrum of malformations associated with congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT). Signaling involving glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor and its receptor RET and coreceptor GFRA1 appears to be particularly important in ureteric bud development. Recent epigenome profiling studies have uncovered dynamic changes of histone H3 lysine K4 (H3K4) methylation during metanephros development, and dysregulated H3K4 methylation has been associated with a syndromic human CAKUT.To investigate whether and how inactivation of Ash2l, which encodes a subunit of the COMPASS methyltransferase responsible for genome-wide H3K4 methylation, might contribute to CAKUT, we inactivated Ash2l specifically from the ureteric bud lineage in C57BL/6 mice and examined the effects on genome-wide H3K4 methylation and metanephros development. Genes and epigenome changes potentially involved in these effects were screened using RNA-seq combined with CUT&Tag-seq.Ureteric bud-specific inactivation of Ash2l caused CAKUT-like phenotypes mainly involving renal dysplasia at birth, which were associated with deficient H3K4 trimethylation. Ash2l inactivation slowed proliferation of cells at the ureteric bud tip, delaying budding and impairing ureteric bud branching morphogenesis. These effects were associated with downregulation of Ret, Gfra1, and Wnt11, which participate in RET/GFRA1 signaling.These experiments identify ASH2L-dependent H3K4 methylation in the ureteric bud lineage as an upstream epigenetic regulator of RET/GFRA1 signaling in ureteric bud morphogenesis, which, if deficient, may lead to CAKUT.Copyright © 2023 by the American Society of Nephrology."
"36756739","Epigenome alterations in food allergy: A systematic review of candidate gene and epigenome-wide association studies.","Clin Exp Allergy","The aim of this study was to systematically review the evidence across studies that assessed DNA methylome variations in association with food allergy (FA).A systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis were carried out within several databases. However, the risk of bias in the included articles was not evaluated.PubMed, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Web of Science were used to search up to July 2022.We included targeted and epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) that assessed DNA methylome alterations in association with FA in adult or paediatric populations.Among 366 publications, only 16 were retained, which were mainly focused on FA in children. Seven candidate gene-targeted studies found associations in Th1/Th2 imbalance (IL4, IL5, IL10, INFG, IL2 and IL12B genes), regulatory T cell function (FOXP3 gene), Toll-like receptors pathway (TLR2, CD14 genes) and digestive barrier integrity (FLG gene). Nine EWAS assessed the association with peanut allergy (n = 3), cow's milk allergy (n = 2) or various food allergens (n = 4). They highlighted 11 differentially methylated loci in at least two studies (RPS6KA2, CAMTA1, CTBP2, RYR2, TRAPPC9, DOCK1, GALNTL4, HDAC4, UMODL1, ZAK and TNS3 genes). Among them, CAMTA1 and RPS6KA2, and CTBP2 are involved in regulatory T cell function and Th2 cell differentiation, respectively. Gene-functional analysis revealed two enriched gene clusters involved in immune responses and protein phosphorylation. ChIP-X Enrichment Analysis 3 showed eight significant transcription factors (RXRA, ZBTB7A, ESR1, TCF3, MYOD1, CTCF, GATA3 and CBX2). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified canonical pathways involved, among other, in B cell development, pathogen-induced cytokine storm signalling pathway and dendritic cell maturation.This review highlights the involvement of epigenomic alterations of loci in Th1/Th2 and regulatory T cell differentiation in both candidate gene studies and EWAS. These alterations provide a better insight into the mechanistic aspects in FA pathogenesis and may guide the development of epigenome-based biomarkers for FA.© 2023 The Authors.

"36754293","A Functional Genomics Pipeline to Identify High-Value Asthma and Allergy CpGs in the Human Methylome.","J Allergy Clin Immunol","DNA methylation of cytosines at CpG dinucleotides is a widespread epigenetic mark; but genome-wide variation has been relatively unexplored due to the limited representation of variable CpGs on commercial high-throughput arrays.To explore this hidden portion of the epigenome, we combined whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) with in silico evidence of gene regulatory regions to design a custom array of high-value CpGs. We focused these studies in airway epithelial cells from children with and without allergic asthma because these cells mediate the effects of inhaled microbes, pollution, and allergens on asthma and allergic disease risk.We identified differentially methylated regions (DMRs) from WGBS in nasal epithelial cell (NEC) DNA from a total of 39 children with and without allergic asthma of both European and African ancestries. We selected CpGs from DMRs, previous allergy or asthma Epigenome-Wide Association Studies (EWAS), or Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) loci, and overlapped them with functional annotations for inclusion on a custom Asthma&Allergy array. Using both the Custom and EPIC arrays, we performed EWAS of allergic sensitization (AS) in NEC DNA from children in the URECA birth cohort and using the Custom array in the INSPIRE birth cohort. We assigned each CpG on the arrays to its nearest gene and its promotor capture Hi-C interacting gene and performed expression quantitative trait methylation (eQTM) studies for both sets of genes.Custom array CpGs were enriched for intermediate methylation (IM) levels compared to EPIC CpGs. IM CpGs were further enriched among those associated with AS and for eQTMs on both arrays.Our study revealed signature features of high-value CpGs and evidence for epigenetic regulation of genes at AS EWAS loci that are robust to race/ethnicity, ascertainment, age, and geography.These studies identified allergic sensitization-associated differentially methylated CpGs and their target genes in airway epithelium, providing potential epigenetic mechanisms in the development of allergic diseases and suggesting novel drug targets.This study of previously unexplored regions of the airway epithelial methylome revealed novel epigenetic mechanisms regulating genes previously implicated in the pathogenesis of asthma and allergic diseases.Copyright © 2023.

"36753963","The role of lysine-specific demethylase 6A (KDM6A) in tumorigenesis and its therapeutic potentials in cancer therapy.","Bioorg Chem","Histone demethylation is a key post-translational modification of chromatin, and its dysregulation affects a wide array of nuclear activities including the maintenance of genome integrity, transcriptional regulation, and epigenetic inheritance. Lysine specific demethylase 6A (KDM6A, also known as UTX) is an Fe2+- and α-ketoglutarate- dependent oxidase which belongs to KDM6 Jumonji histone demethylase subfamily, and it can remove mono-, di- and tri-methyl groups from methylated lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me1/2/3). Mounting studies indicate that KDM6A is responsible for driving multiple human diseases, particularly cancers and pharmacological inhibition of KDM6A is an effective strategy to treat varieties of KDM6A-amplified cancers in cellulo and in vivo. Although there are several reviews on the roles of KDM6 subfamily in cancer development and therapy, all of them only simply introduce the roles of KDM6A in cancer without systematically summarizing the specific mechanisms of KDM6A in tumorigenesis, which greatly limits the advances on the understanding of roles KDM6A in varieties of cancers, discovering targeting selective KDM6A inhibitors, and exploring the adaptive profiles of KDM6A antagonists. Herein, we present the structure and functions of KDM6A, simply outline the functions of KDM6A in homeostasis and non-cancer diseases, summarize the role of KDM6A and its distinct target genes/ligand proteins in development of varieties of cancers, systematically classify KDM6A inhibitors, sum up the difficulties encountered in the research of KDM6A and the discovery of related drugs, and provide the corresponding solutions, which will contribute to understanding the roles of KDM6A in carcinogenesis and advancing the progression of KDM6A as a drug target in cancer therapy.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

"36752523","Circulating triglycerides are associated with human adipose tissue DNA methylation of genes linked to metabolic disease.","Hum Mol Genet","Dysregulation of circulating lipids is a central element for the metabolic syndrome. However, it is not well established whether human subcutaneous adipose tissue is affected by or affect circulating lipids through epigenetic mechanisms. Hence, our aim was to investigate the association between circulating lipids and DNA methylation levels in human adipose tissue.DNA methylation and gene expression were analyzed genome-wide in subcutaneous adipose tissue from two different cohorts, including 85 men and 93 women, respectively. Associations between DNA methylation and circulating levels of triglycerides, LDL, HDL and total cholesterol were analysed. Causal mediation analyses tested if adipose tissue DNA methylation mediates the effects of triglycerides on gene expression or insulin resistance.We found 115 novel associations between triglycerides and adipose tissue DNA methylation, e.g. in the promoter of RFS1, ARID2, and HOXA5 in the male cohort (p ≤ 1.1x10-7), and 63 associations e.g. within the gene body of PTPRN2 and COL6A3 in the female cohort. We further connected these findings to altered mRNA expression levels in adipose tissue (e.g. HOXA5, IL11 and FAM45B). Interestingly, there was no overlap between methylation sites associated with triglycerides in men and the sites found in women, which points towards sex-specific effects of triglycerides on the epigenome. Finally, a causal mediation analysis provided support for adipose tissue DNA methylation as a partial mediating factor between circulating triglycerides and insulin resistance.This study identified novel epigenetic alterations in adipose tissue associated with circulating lipids. Identified epigenetic changes seem to mediate effects of triglycerides on insulin resistance.© The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

"36725932","mRNA ageing shapes the Cap2 methylome in mammalian mRNA.","Nature","The mRNA cap structure is a major site of dynamic mRNA methylation. mRNA caps exist in either the Cap1 or Cap2 form, depending on the presence of 2'-O-methylation on the first transcribed nucleotide or both the first and second transcribed nucleotides, respectively1,2. However, the identity of Cap2-containing mRNAs and the function of Cap2 are unclear. Here we describe CLAM-Cap-seq, a method for transcriptome-wide mapping and quantification of Cap2. We find that unlike other epitranscriptomic modifications, Cap2 can occur on all mRNAs. Cap2 is formed through a slow continuous conversion of mRNAs from Cap1 to Cap2 as mRNAs age in the cytosol. As a result, Cap2 is enriched on long-lived mRNAs. Large increases in the abundance of Cap1 leads to activation of RIG-I, especially in conditions in which expression of RIG-I is increased. The methylation of Cap1 to Cap2 markedly reduces the ability of RNAs to bind to and activate RIG-I. The slow methylation rate of Cap2 allows Cap2 to accumulate on host mRNAs, yet ensures that low levels of Cap2 occur on newly expressed viral RNAs. Overall, these results reveal an immunostimulatory role for Cap1, and that Cap2 functions to reduce activation of the innate immune response.© 2023.

"36669384","Nitric oxide promotes cell-matrix adhesion of endothelial progenitor cells under hypoxia condition via ITGA5 CpG promoter demethylation.","Biochem Biophys Res Commun","Hypoxia or low oxygen tension causes changes in the structure and functional phenotype of the endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). EPCs are found to be involved in angiogenesis and vascular repair. However, EPC's role in cell-matrix adhesion under hypoxia conditions is not clearly established. Nitric oxide (NO) exerts a wide range of biological functions, especially in regulating the mobilization and vascular repair of EPCs. In contrast, the link between NO and its role in cell-matrix deadhesion under hypoxia is not studied yet. Here, we investigated the protective role of NO in hypoxia-induced cell-matrix deadhesion of EPCs through an epigenetic mechanism. The EPCs were exposed to 2% hypoxia in the presence or absence of 10 μM Spermine NONOate (NO donor). The result demonstrates that hypoxia exposure intensified mitochondrial oxidative damage and energy defects. Using miScript miRNA qPCR array-based screening, the study found miR-148 as a novel target of hypoxia-induced DNMT1 activation. Mechanistically, the study discovered that hypoxia suppressed miR-148 levels and stimulated EPCs cell-matrix deadhesion via increasing DNMT1 mediated Integrin alpha-5 (ITGA5) CpG promoter hypermethylation. Treatment with a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant, MitoTEMPO, or epigenetic DNMT inhibitor, 5'-azacitidine, or miR-148 overexpression in hypoxic EPCs culture, prevented the cell-matrix deadhesion compared to hypoxic EPCs. Further, treatment of spNO or transient expression of eNOS-GFP attenuated hypoxia-induced cell-matrix deadhesion via inhibition of ITGA5 CpG island promoter methylation. In conclusion, the study provides evidence that NO is essential for cell-matrix adhesion of EPCs by epigenetically mitigating ITGA5 CpG promoter hypermethylation under hypoxia conditions. This finding uncovers the previously undefined mechanism of NO-mediated diminution of hypoxia-induced cell-matrix deadhesion and dysfunction induced by low oxygen tension.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc.
