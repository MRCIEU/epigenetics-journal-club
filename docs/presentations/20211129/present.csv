Epigenetics,34789882,Cell-type specialization is encoded by specific chromatin topologies.,Nature,"The three-dimensional (3D) structure of chromatin is intrinsically associated with gene regulation and cell function1-3. Methods based on chromatin conformation capture have mapped chromatin structures in neuronal systems such as in vitro differentiated neurons, neurons isolated through fluorescence-activated cell sorting from cortical tissues pooled from different animals and from dissociated whole hippocampi4-6. However, changes in chromatin organization captured by imaging, such as the relocation of Bdnf away from the nuclear periphery after activation7, are invisible with such approaches8. Here we developed immunoGAM, an extension of genome architecture mapping (GAM)2,9, to map 3D chromatin topology genome-wide in specific brain cell types, without tissue disruption, from single animals. GAM is a ligation-free technology that maps genome topology by sequencing the DNA content from thin (about 220 nm) nuclear cryosections. Chromatin interactions are identified from the increased probability of co-segregation of contacting loci across a collection of nuclear slices. ImmunoGAM expands the scope of GAM to enable the selection of specific cell types using low cell numbers (approximately 1,000 cells) within a complex tissue and avoids tissue dissociation2,10. We report cell-type specialized 3D chromatin structures at multiple genomic scales that relate to patterns of gene expression. We discover extensive 'melting' of long genes when they are highly expressed and/or have high chromatin accessibility. The contacts most specific of neuron subtypes contain genes associated with specialized processes, such as addiction and synaptic plasticity, which harbour putative binding sites for neuronal transcription factors within accessible chromatin regions. Moreover, sensory receptor genes are preferentially found in heterochromatic compartments in brain cells, which establish strong contacts across tens of megabases. Our results demonstrate that highly specific chromatin conformations in brain cells are tightly related to gene regulation mechanisms and specialized functions.© 2021. The Author(s)."
Prediction,34791072,Genome-Scale Methylation Analysis of Circulating Cell-Free DNA in Gastric Cancer Patients.,Clin Chem,"Aberrant DNA hypermethylation of CpG islands (CGIs) occurs frequently and is genome-wide in human gastric cancer (GC). A DNA methylation approach in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is attractive for the noninvasive detection of GC. Here, we performed genome-scale cfDNA methylation analysis in patients with GC.We used MCTA-Seq, a genome-scale DNA methylation analysis method, on the plasma samples of patients with GC (n = 89) and control participants (n = 82), as well as 28 pairs of GC and adjacent noncancerous tissues. The capacity of the method for detecting GC and discriminating GC from colorectal cancer (CRC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was assessed.We identified 153 cfDNA methylation biomarkers, including DOCK10, CABIN1, and KCNQ5, for detecting GC in blood. A panel of these biomarkers gave a sensitivity of 44%, 59%, 78%, and 100% for stage I, II, III, and IV tumors, respectively, at a specificity of 92%. CpG island methylation phenotype (CIMP) tumors and NON-CIMP tumors could be distinguished and detected effectively. We also identified several hundreds of cfDNA biomarkers differentially methylated between GC, CRC, and HCC, and showed that MCTA-Seq can discriminate early-stage GC, CRC, and HCC in blood by using a high specificity (approximately 100%) algorithm.Our comprehensive analyses provided valuable data on cfDNA methylation biomarkers of GC and showed the promise of cfDNA methylation for the blood-based noninvasive detection of GC.© American Association for Clinical Chemistry 2021."
Prediction,34789321,"Epigenetic modelling of former, current and never smokers.",Clin Epigenetics,"DNA methylation (DNAm) performs excellently in the discrimination of current and former smokers from never smokers, where AUCs > 0.9 are regularly reported using a single CpG site (cg05575921; AHRR). However, there is a paucity of DNAm models which attempt to distinguish current, former and never smokers as individual classes. Derivation of a robust DNAm model that accurately distinguishes between current, former and never smokers would be particularly valuable to epidemiological research (as a more accurate smoking definition vs. self-report) and could potentially translate to clinical settings. Therefore, we appraise 4 DNAm models of ternary smoking status (that is, current, former and never smokers): methylation at cg05575921 (AHRR model), weighted scores from 13 CpGs created by Maas et al. (Maas model), weighted scores from a LASSO model of candidate smoking CpGs from the literature (candidate CpG LASSO model), and weighted scores from a LASSO model supplied with genome-wide 450K data (agnostic LASSO model). Discrimination is assessed by AUC, whilst classification accuracy is assessed by accuracy and kappa, derived from confusion matrices.We find that DNAm can classify ternary smoking status with reasonable accuracy, including when applied to external data. Ternary classification using only DNAm far exceeds the classification accuracy of simply assigning all classes as the most prevalent class (63.7% vs. 36.4%). Further, we develop a DNAm classifier which performs well in discriminating current from former smokers (agnostic LASSO model AUC in external validation data: 0.744). Finally, across our DNAm models, we show evidence of enrichment for biological pathways and human phenotype ontologies relevant to smoking, such as haemostasis, molybdenum cofactor synthesis, body fatness and social behaviours, providing evidence of the generalisability of our classifiers.Our findings suggest that DNAm can classify ternary smoking status with close to 65% accuracy. Both the ternary smoking status classifiers and current versus former smoking status classifiers address the present lack of former smoker classification in epigenetic literature; essential if DNAm classifiers are to adequately relate to real-world populations. To improve performance further, additional focus on improving discrimination of current from former smokers is necessary.© 2021. The Author(s)."
Prediction,34745991,A CpG Methylation Signature as a Potential Marker for Early Diagnosis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma From HBV-Related Liver Disease Using Multiplex Bisulfite Sequencing.,Front Oncol,"Aberrant methylation of CpG sites served as an epigenetic marker for building diagnostic, prognostic, and recurrence models for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Using Illumina 450K and EPIC Beadchip, we identified 34 CpG sites in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) DNA that were differentially methylated in early HCC versus HBV-related liver diseases (HBVLD). We employed multiplex bisulfite sequencing (MBS) based on next-generation sequencing (NGS) to measure methylation of 34 CpG sites in PBMC DNA from 654 patients that were divided into a training set (n= 442) and a test set (n= 212). Using the training set, we selected and built a six-CpG-scorer (namely, cg14171514, cg07721852, cg05166871, cg18087306, cg05213896, and cg18772205), applying least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. We performed multivariable analyses of four candidate risk predictors (namely, six-CpG-scorer, age, sex, and AFP level), using 20 times imputation of missing data, non-linearly transformed, and backwards feature selection with logistic regression. The final model's regression coefficients were calculated according to ""Rubin's Rules"". The diagnostic accuracy of the model was internally validated with a 10,000 bootstrap validation dataset and then applied to the test set for validation.The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of the model was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.77-0.85) and it showed good calibration and decision curve analysis. Using enhanced bootstrap validation, adjusted C-statistics and adjusted Brier score were 0.809 and 0.199, respectively. The model also showed an AUROC value of 0.84 (95% CI 0.79-0.88) of diagnosis for early HCC in the test set.Our model based on the six-CpG-scorer was a reliable diagnosis tool for early HCC from HBVLD. The usage of the MBS method can realize large-scale detection of CpG sites in clinical diagnosis of early HCC and benefit the majority of patients.Copyright © 2021 Li, Song, Qin, Li, Jiang, Ren, Zang, Sun, Zhao and Zhang."
Prediction,34786085,Combined detection of stool-based methylation indicators for early screening of colorectal neoplasm.,Am J Transl Res,"In the past two decades, several methylated DNA targets, including gene promoters and other intronic markers have been explored in tumors and benign lesions. Therefore, it can be expected that a panel of stool-based biomarkers will become a screening method for colorectal cancer (CRC) and adenoma with better sensitivity and specificity, aiming to decrease the incidence and mortality of CRC. In this study, the methylation of secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (SFRP1), hyperplastic polyposis protein 1 (HPP1), α-internexin (INA), Wnt inhibitory factor 1 (WIF1), tissue factor pathway inhibitor 2 (TFPI2), ikaros family zinc finger protein 1 (IKZF1), and spastic paraplegia 20 (SPG20) were detected in stool samples from patients with CRC, adenoma, polyps, and healthy controls, respectively, and these biomarkers were used to establish a logistic regression model for classification. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn to assess the importance of each biomarker. Subsequently, a biomarker or combination of biomarkers was analyzed for early screening of high-risk neoplasm. The data showed that when a single biomarker was used for CRC screening, the sensitivity ranged from 63.9% to 76.8%, the area under the curve (AUC) ranged from 0.821 to 0.875, and the accuracy ranged from 77.0% to 84.5%. Finally, the methylation of SFRP1, HPP1, TFPI2, and IKZF1 was selected using a backward stepwise method in the multivariate logistic analysis according to the Akaike Information Criterion. These findings indicate that stool DNA biomarkers have good diagnostic power in discriminating high-risk level of neoplasm from healthy population.AJTR Copyright © 2021."
