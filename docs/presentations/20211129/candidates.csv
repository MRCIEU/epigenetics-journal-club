No,DNAm age,34747582,When Anger Remains Unspoken: Anger and Accelerated Epigenetic Aging Among Stress-Exposed Black Americans.,Psychosom Med,"Race-related lifetime stress exposure (LSE) including racial discrimination, trauma, and stressful life events have been shown to contribute to racial health disparities. However, little is known about associations between race-related stressors and premature biological aging that confer the risk of adverse health outcomes. Even less is known about the mechanisms through which race-related stressors may be associated with accelerated aging. Early evidence suggests psychological processes such as anger, and particularly the internalization of anger, may play a role.In a community sample of predominantly low-income Black adults (n = 219; age = 45.91 [12.33] years; 64% female), the present study examined the association of race-related LSE (as defined by exposure to racial discrimination, trauma, and stressful life events) and epigenetic age acceleration through anger expression.Internalized and externalized anger expression were each significantly associated with LSE and age acceleration. Although LSE was not directly associated with age acceleration (ΔR2 = 0.001, p = .64), we found that greater LSE was indirectly associated with age acceleration through increases in internalized, but not externalized, anger (indirect effect: β = 0.03, standard error = 0.02, 95% confidence interval = 0.003 to 0.08; total effect: β = 0.02, 95% confidence interval = -0.25 to 0.31).These results suggest race-related LSE may elicit the internalization of anger, which, along with the externalization of anger, may initiate detrimental epigenetic alterations that confer the risk of adverse health outcomes. These findings lay the groundwork for longitudinal studies of the association between race-related stress and racial health disparities.Copyright © 2021 by the American Psychosomatic Society."
No,Epigenetics,34795220,Epromoters function as a hub to recruit key transcription factors required for the inflammatory response.,Nat Commun,"Gene expression is controlled by the involvement of gene-proximal (promoters) and distal (enhancers) regulatory elements. Our previous results demonstrated that a subset of gene promoters, termed Epromoters, work as bona fide enhancers and regulate distal gene expression. Here, we hypothesized that Epromoters play a key role in the coordination of rapid gene induction during the inflammatory response. Using a high-throughput reporter assay we explored the function of Epromoters in response to type I interferon. We find that clusters of IFNa-induced genes are frequently associated with Epromoters and that these regulatory elements preferentially recruit the STAT1/2 and IRF transcription factors and distally regulate the activation of interferon-response genes. Consistently, we identified and validated the involvement of Epromoter-containing clusters in the regulation of LPS-stimulated macrophages. Our findings suggest that Epromoters function as a local hub recruiting the key TFs required for coordinated regulation of gene clusters during the inflammatory response.© 2021. The Author(s)."
No,Epigenetics,34789882,Cell-type specialization is encoded by specific chromatin topologies.,Nature,"The three-dimensional (3D) structure of chromatin is intrinsically associated with gene regulation and cell function1-3. Methods based on chromatin conformation capture have mapped chromatin structures in neuronal systems such as in vitro differentiated neurons, neurons isolated through fluorescence-activated cell sorting from cortical tissues pooled from different animals and from dissociated whole hippocampi4-6. However, changes in chromatin organization captured by imaging, such as the relocation of Bdnf away from the nuclear periphery after activation7, are invisible with such approaches8. Here we developed immunoGAM, an extension of genome architecture mapping (GAM)2,9, to map 3D chromatin topology genome-wide in specific brain cell types, without tissue disruption, from single animals. GAM is a ligation-free technology that maps genome topology by sequencing the DNA content from thin (about 220 nm) nuclear cryosections. Chromatin interactions are identified from the increased probability of co-segregation of contacting loci across a collection of nuclear slices. ImmunoGAM expands the scope of GAM to enable the selection of specific cell types using low cell numbers (approximately 1,000 cells) within a complex tissue and avoids tissue dissociation2,10. We report cell-type specialized 3D chromatin structures at multiple genomic scales that relate to patterns of gene expression. We discover extensive 'melting' of long genes when they are highly expressed and/or have high chromatin accessibility. The contacts most specific of neuron subtypes contain genes associated with specialized processes, such as addiction and synaptic plasticity, which harbour putative binding sites for neuronal transcription factors within accessible chromatin regions. Moreover, sensory receptor genes are preferentially found in heterochromatic compartments in brain cells, which establish strong contacts across tens of megabases. Our results demonstrate that highly specific chromatin conformations in brain cells are tightly related to gene regulation mechanisms and specialized functions.© 2021. The Author(s)."

Epigenetic modifications of the chromatin confer plasticity to the genetic information and give insight into how tissues use the genetic information to adapt to environmental factors. The oral mucosa is particularly exposed to environmental stressors such as a variable microbiota. Likewise, persistent oral inflammation is the most important intrinsic risk factor for the oral inflammatory disease periodontitis and has strong potential to alter DNA-methylation patterns. The aim of the current study was to identify epigenetic changes of the oral masticatory mucosa in response to long-term inflammation that resulted in periodontitis.Genome-wide CpG methylation of both inflamed and clinically uninflamed solid gingival tissue biopsies of 60 periodontitis cases was analyzed using the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. We validated and performed cell-type deconvolution for infiltrated immune cells using the EpiDish algorithm. Effect sizes of DMPs in gingival epithelial and fibroblast cells were estimated and adjusted for confounding factors using our recently developed ""intercept-method"". In the current EWAS, we identified various genes that showed significantly different methylation between periodontitis-inflamed and uninflamed oral mucosa in periodontitis patients. The strongest differences were observed for genes with roles in wound healing (ROBO2, PTP4A3), cell adhesion (LPXN) and innate immune response (CCL26, DNAJC1, BPI). Enrichment analyses implied a role of epigenetic changes for vesicle trafficking gene sets.Our results imply specific adaptations of the oral mucosa to a persistent inflammatory environment that involve wound repair, barrier integrity, and innate immune defense.© 2021.

DNA methylation changes may confer risk or protection for PTSD following rape by regulating the expression of genes implicated in pathways affected by PTSD. We aimed to: (1) identify epigenome-wide differences in methylation profiles between rape-exposed women with and without PTSD at 3-months post-rape, in a demographically and ethnically similar group, drawn from a low-income setting; (2) validate and replicate the findings of the epigenome-wide analysis in selected genes (BRSK2 and ADCYAP1); and (3) investigate baseline and longitudinal changes in BRSK2 and ADCYAP1 methylation over six months in relation to change in PTSD symptom scores over 6 months, in the combined discovery/validation and replication samples (n = 96). Rape-exposed women (n = 852) were recruited from rape clinics in the Rape Impact Cohort Evaluation (RICE) umbrella study. Epigenome-wide differentially methylated CpG sites between rape-exposed women with (n = 24) and without (n = 24) PTSD at 3-months post-rape were investigated using the Illumina EPIC BeadChip in a discovery cohort (n = 48). Validation (n = 47) and replication (n = 49) of BRSK2 and ADCYAP1 methylation findings were investigated using EpiTYPER technology. Longitudinal change in BRSK2 and ADCYAP1 was also investigated using EpiTYPER technology in the combined sample (n = 96). In the discovery sample, after adjustment for multiple comparisons, one differentially methylated CpG site (chr10: 61385771/ cg01700569, p = 0.049) and thirty-four differentially methylated regions were associated with PTSD status at 3-months post-rape. Decreased BRSK2 and ADCYAP1 methylation at 3-months and 6-months post-rape were associated with increased PTSD scores at the same time points, but these findings did not remain significant in adjusted models. In conclusion, decreased methylation of BRSK2 may result in abnormal neuronal polarization, synaptic development, vesicle formation, and disrupted neurotransmission in individuals with PTSD. PTSD symptoms may also be mediated by differential methylation of the ADCYAP1 gene which is involved in stress regulation. Replication of these findings is required to determine whether ADCYAP1 and BRSK2 are biomarkers of PTSD and potential therapeutic targets.© 2021. The Author(s)."

No,Methods,34765918,How many markers are needed to robustly determine a cell's type?,iScience,"Our understanding of cell types has advanced considerably with the publication of single-cell atlases. Marker genes play an essential role for experimental validation and computational analyses such as physiological characterization, annotation, and deconvolution. However, a framework for quantifying marker replicability and selecting replicable markers is currently lacking. Here, using high-quality data from the Brain Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN), we systematically investigate marker replicability for 85 neuronal cell types. We show that, due to dataset-specific noise, we need to combine 5 datasets to obtain robust differentially expressed (DE) genes, particularly for rare populations and lowly expressed genes. We estimate that 10 to 200 meta-analytic markers provide optimal downstream performance and make available replicable marker lists for the 85 BICCN cell types. Replicable marker lists condense interpretable and generalizable information about cell types, opening avenues for downstream applications, including cell type annotation, selection of gene panels, and bulk data deconvolution.© 2021 The Authors."
No,Prediction,34791072,Genome-Scale Methylation Analysis of Circulating Cell-Free DNA in Gastric Cancer Patients.,Clin Chem,"Aberrant DNA hypermethylation of CpG islands (CGIs) occurs frequently and is genome-wide in human gastric cancer (GC). A DNA methylation approach in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is attractive for the noninvasive detection of GC. Here, we performed genome-scale cfDNA methylation analysis in patients with GC.We used MCTA-Seq, a genome-scale DNA methylation analysis method, on the plasma samples of patients with GC (n = 89) and control participants (n = 82), as well as 28 pairs of GC and adjacent noncancerous tissues. The capacity of the method for detecting GC and discriminating GC from colorectal cancer (CRC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was assessed.We identified 153 cfDNA methylation biomarkers, including DOCK10, CABIN1, and KCNQ5, for detecting GC in blood. A panel of these biomarkers gave a sensitivity of 44%, 59%, 78%, and 100% for stage I, II, III, and IV tumors, respectively, at a specificity of 92%. CpG island methylation phenotype (CIMP) tumors and NON-CIMP tumors could be distinguished and detected effectively. We also identified several hundreds of cfDNA biomarkers differentially methylated between GC, CRC, and HCC, and showed that MCTA-Seq can discriminate early-stage GC, CRC, and HCC in blood by using a high specificity (approximately 100%) algorithm.Our comprehensive analyses provided valuable data on cfDNA methylation biomarkers of GC and showed the promise of cfDNA methylation for the blood-based noninvasive detection of GC.© American Association for Clinical Chemistry 2021."
No,Prediction,34789321,"Epigenetic modelling of former, current and never smokers.",Clin Epigenetics,"DNA methylation (DNAm) performs excellently in the discrimination of current and former smokers from never smokers, where AUCs > 0.9 are regularly reported using a single CpG site (cg05575921; AHRR). However, there is a paucity of DNAm models which attempt to distinguish current, former and never smokers as individual classes. Derivation of a robust DNAm model that accurately distinguishes between current, former and never smokers would be particularly valuable to epidemiological research (as a more accurate smoking definition vs. self-report) and could potentially translate to clinical settings. Therefore, we appraise 4 DNAm models of ternary smoking status (that is, current, former and never smokers): methylation at cg05575921 (AHRR model), weighted scores from 13 CpGs created by Maas et al. (Maas model), weighted scores from a LASSO model of candidate smoking CpGs from the literature (candidate CpG LASSO model), and weighted scores from a LASSO model supplied with genome-wide 450K data (agnostic LASSO model). Discrimination is assessed by AUC, whilst classification accuracy is assessed by accuracy and kappa, derived from confusion matrices.We find that DNAm can classify ternary smoking status with reasonable accuracy, including when applied to external data. Ternary classification using only DNAm far exceeds the classification accuracy of simply assigning all classes as the most prevalent class (63.7% vs. 36.4%). Further, we develop a DNAm classifier which performs well in discriminating current from former smokers (agnostic LASSO model AUC in external validation data: 0.744). Finally, across our DNAm models, we show evidence of enrichment for biological pathways and human phenotype ontologies relevant to smoking, such as haemostasis, molybdenum cofactor synthesis, body fatness and social behaviours, providing evidence of the generalisability of our classifiers.Our findings suggest that DNAm can classify ternary smoking status with close to 65% accuracy. Both the ternary smoking status classifiers and current versus former smoking status classifiers address the present lack of former smoker classification in epigenetic literature; essential if DNAm classifiers are to adequately relate to real-world populations. To improve performance further, additional focus on improving discrimination of current from former smokers is necessary.© 2021. The Author(s)."
No,Prediction,34780523,A 6-CpG validated methylation risk score model for metabolic syndrome: The HyperGEN and GOLDN studies.,PLoS One,"There has been great interest in genetic risk prediction using risk scores in recent years, however, the utility of scores developed in European populations and later applied to non-European populations has not been successful. The goal of this study was to create a methylation risk score (MRS) for metabolic syndrome (MetS), demonstrating the utility of MRS across race groups using cross-sectional data from the Hypertension Genetic Epidemiology Network (HyperGEN, N = 614 African Americans (AA)) and the Genetics of Lipid Lowering Drugs and Diet Network (GOLDN, N = 995 European Americans (EA)). To demonstrate this, we first selected cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpG) sites measured on Illumina Methyl450 arrays previously reported to be significantly associated with MetS and/or component conditions in more than one race/ethnic group (CPT1A cg00574958, PHOSPHO1 cg02650017, ABCG1 cg06500161, SREBF1 cg11024682, SOCS3 cg18181703, TXNIP cg19693031). Second, we calculated the parameter estimates for the 6 CpGs in the HyperGEN data (AA) and used the beta estimates as weights to construct a MRS in HyperGEN (AA), which was validated in GOLDN (EA). We performed association analyses using logistic mixed models to test the association between the MRS and MetS, adjusting for covariates. Results showed the MRS was significantly associated with MetS in both populations. In summary, a MRS for MetS was a strong predictor for the condition across two race groups, suggesting MRS may be useful to examine metabolic disease risk or related complications across race/ethnic groups."
No,Prediction,34732805,The relationship of smoking to cg05575921 methylation in blood and saliva DNA samples from several studies.,Sci Rep,"Numerous studies have shown that cg05575921 methylation decreases in response to smoking. However, secondary to methodological issues, the magnitude and dose dependency of that response is as of yet unclear. This lack of certainty is a barrier to the use of DNA methylation clinically to assess and monitor smoking status. To better define this relationship, we conducted a joint analysis of methylation sensitive PCR digital (MSdPCR) assessments of cg05575921 methylation in whole blood and/or saliva DNA to smoking using samples from 421 smokers and 423 biochemically confirmed non-smokers from 4 previously published studies. We found that cg05575921 methylation manifested a curvilinear dose dependent decrease in response to increasing cigarette consumption. In whole blood DNA, the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Area Under the Curve (AUC) of cg05575921 methylation for predicting daily smoking status was 0.98. In saliva DNA, the gross AUC was 0.91 with correction for cellular heterogeneity improving the AUC to 0.94. Methylation status was significantly associated with the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence score, but with significant sampling heterogeneity. We conclude that MSdPCR assessments of cg05575921 methylation are a potentially powerful, clinically implementable tool for the assessment and management of smoking.© 2021. The Author(s)."
No,Prediction,34702360,Validating biomarkers and models for epigenetic inference of alcohol consumption from blood.,Clin Epigenetics,"Information on long-term alcohol consumption is relevant for medical and public health research, disease therapy, and other areas. Recently, DNA methylation-based inference of alcohol consumption from blood was reported with high accuracy, but these results were based on employing the same dataset for model training and testing, which can lead to accuracy overestimation. Moreover, only subsets of alcohol consumption categories were used, which makes it impossible to extrapolate such models to the general population. By using data from eight population-based European cohorts (N = 4677), we internally and externally validated the previously reported biomarkers and models for epigenetic inference of alcohol consumption from blood and developed new models comprising all data from all categories.By employing data from six European cohorts (N = 2883), we empirically tested the reproducibility of the previously suggested biomarkers and prediction models via ten-fold internal cross-validation. In contrast to previous findings, all seven models based on 144-CpGs yielded lower mean AUCs compared to the models with less CpGs. For instance, the 144-CpG heavy versus non-drinkers model gave an AUC of 0.78 ± 0.06, while the 5 and 23 CpG models achieved 0.83 ± 0.05, respectively. The transportability of the models was empirically tested via external validation in three independent European cohorts (N = 1794), revealing high AUC variance between datasets within models. For instance, the 144-CpG heavy versus non-drinkers model yielded AUCs ranging from 0.60 to 0.84 between datasets. The newly developed models that considered data from all categories showed low AUCs but gave low AUC variation in the external validation. For instance, the 144-CpG heavy and at-risk versus light and non-drinkers model achieved AUCs of 0.67 ± 0.02 in the internal cross-validation and 0.61-0.66 in the external validation datasets.The outcomes of our internal and external validation demonstrate that the previously reported prediction models suffer from both overfitting and accuracy overestimation. Our results show that the previously proposed biomarkers are not yet sufficient for accurate and robust inference of alcohol consumption from blood. Overall, our findings imply that DNA methylation prediction biomarkers and models need to be improved considerably before epigenetic inference of alcohol consumption from blood can be considered for practical applications.© 2021.

No,Prediction,34745991,A CpG Methylation Signature as a Potential Marker for Early Diagnosis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma From HBV-Related Liver Disease Using Multiplex Bisulfite Sequencing.,Front Oncol,"Aberrant methylation of CpG sites served as an epigenetic marker for building diagnostic, prognostic, and recurrence models for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Using Illumina 450K and EPIC Beadchip, we identified 34 CpG sites in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) DNA that were differentially methylated in early HCC versus HBV-related liver diseases (HBVLD). We employed multiplex bisulfite sequencing (MBS) based on next-generation sequencing (NGS) to measure methylation of 34 CpG sites in PBMC DNA from 654 patients that were divided into a training set (n= 442) and a test set (n= 212). Using the training set, we selected and built a six-CpG-scorer (namely, cg14171514, cg07721852, cg05166871, cg18087306, cg05213896, and cg18772205), applying least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. We performed multivariable analyses of four candidate risk predictors (namely, six-CpG-scorer, age, sex, and AFP level), using 20 times imputation of missing data, non-linearly transformed, and backwards feature selection with logistic regression. The final model's regression coefficients were calculated according to ""Rubin's Rules"". The diagnostic accuracy of the model was internally validated with a 10,000 bootstrap validation dataset and then applied to the test set for validation.The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of the model was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.77-0.85) and it showed good calibration and decision curve analysis. Using enhanced bootstrap validation, adjusted C-statistics and adjusted Brier score were 0.809 and 0.199, respectively. The model also showed an AUROC value of 0.84 (95% CI 0.79-0.88) of diagnosis for early HCC in the test set.Our model based on the six-CpG-scorer was a reliable diagnosis tool for early HCC from HBVLD. The usage of the MBS method can realize large-scale detection of CpG sites in clinical diagnosis of early HCC and benefit the majority of patients.Copyright © 2021 Li, Song, Qin, Li, Jiang, Ren, Zang, Sun, Zhao and Zhang."
No,Prediction,34786085,Combined detection of stool-based methylation indicators for early screening of colorectal neoplasm.,Am J Transl Res,"In the past two decades, several methylated DNA targets, including gene promoters and other intronic markers have been explored in tumors and benign lesions. Therefore, it can be expected that a panel of stool-based biomarkers will become a screening method for colorectal cancer (CRC) and adenoma with better sensitivity and specificity, aiming to decrease the incidence and mortality of CRC. In this study, the methylation of secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (SFRP1), hyperplastic polyposis protein 1 (HPP1), α-internexin (INA), Wnt inhibitory factor 1 (WIF1), tissue factor pathway inhibitor 2 (TFPI2), ikaros family zinc finger protein 1 (IKZF1), and spastic paraplegia 20 (SPG20) were detected in stool samples from patients with CRC, adenoma, polyps, and healthy controls, respectively, and these biomarkers were used to establish a logistic regression model for classification. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn to assess the importance of each biomarker. Subsequently, a biomarker or combination of biomarkers was analyzed for early screening of high-risk neoplasm. The data showed that when a single biomarker was used for CRC screening, the sensitivity ranged from 63.9% to 76.8%, the area under the curve (AUC) ranged from 0.821 to 0.875, and the accuracy ranged from 77.0% to 84.5%. Finally, the methylation of SFRP1, HPP1, TFPI2, and IKZF1 was selected using a backward stepwise method in the multivariate logistic analysis according to the Akaike Information Criterion. These findings indicate that stool DNA biomarkers have good diagnostic power in discriminating high-risk level of neoplasm from healthy population.AJTR Copyright © 2021."

However, the biological processes that are modulated by recombinant hGH are not well characterized and associated blood serum proteins may constitute new biomarkers for hGH misuse.Thirty-five recreational athletes were enrolled in a study to investigate the time- and dose-dependent response of serum protein levels to recombinant hGH administration. Participants were randomly assigned to 4 groups, receiving 1 of 3 different doses of recombinant hGH or a placebo. Bio samples were collected at 22 time points over a period of 13 weeks, starting 4 weeks before treatment, during 3 weeks of treatment, and at 6 weeks' follow-up. A total of 749 serum samples were analyzed for 1305 protein markers using the SOMAscan proteomics platform.We identified 66 proteins that significantly associated with recombinant hGH administration and dosage, including well known hGH targets, such as IGF1, but also previously unknown hGH-related proteins (eg, protease inhibitors, WFIKKN1, and chemokines, CCL2). Network analysis revealed changes in specific biological pathways, mainly related to the immune system and glucose metabolism.Our analysis suggests that hGH administration affects biological processes more strongly than previously acknowledged. Some of the proteins were dysregulated even after hGH treatment and could potentially be developed into biomarkers for hGH misuse. Moreover, our findings suggest new roles for hGH-associated proteins in the etiology of hGH-related diseases and may indicate new risks that may be associated with hGH misuse.© The Author(s) 2021.

Thus, we aimed to explore epigenetic relationships between genome-wide DNA methylation levels and pulmonary function among middle-aged Chinese monozygotic twins.The monozygotic twin sample was drawn from the Qingdao Twin Registry. Pulmonary function was measured by three parameters including forced expiratory volume the first second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and FEV1/FVC ratio. Linear mixed effect model was used to regress the methylation level of CpG sites on pulmonary function. After that, we applied Genomic Regions Enrichment of Annotations Tool (GREAT) to predict the genomic regions enrichment, and used comb-p python library to detect differentially methylated regions (DMRs). Gene expression analysis was conducted to validate the results of differentially methylated analyses.We identified 112 CpG sites with the level of P < 1 × 10-4which were annotated to 40 genes. We identified 12 common enriched pathways of three pulmonary function parameters. We detected 39 DMRs located at 23 genes, of which PRDM1 was related to decreased pulmonary function, and MPL, LTB4R2, and EPHB3 were related to increased pulmonary function. The gene expression analyses validated DIP2C, ASB2, SLC6A5, and GAS6 related to decreased pulmonary function.Our DNA methylation sequencing analysis on identical twins provides new references for the epigenetic regulation on pulmonary function.

DNA methylation (DNAm) may be involved in pathways linking prenatal metal exposure and health. In the Project Viva cohort, we analyzed the extent to which metals (As, Ba, Cd, Cr, Cs, Cu, Hg, Mg, Mn, Pb, Se, and Zn) measured in maternal erythrocytes were associated with differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and regions (DMRs) in cord blood and tested if associations persisted in blood collected in mid-childhood. We measured metal concentrations in first-trimester maternal erythrocytes, and DNAm in cord blood (N = 361) and mid-childhood blood (N = 333, 6-10 years) with the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. For each metal individually, we tested for DMPs using linear models (considered significant at FDR < 0.05), and for DMRs using comb-p (Sidak p < 0.05). Covariates included biologically relevant variables and estimated cell-type composition. We also performed sex-stratified analyses.Pb was associated with decreased methylation of cg20608990 (CASP8) (FDR = 0.04), and Mn was associated with increased methylation of cg02042823 (A2BP1) in cord blood (FDR = 9.73 × 10-6). Both associations remained significant but attenuated in blood DNAm collected at mid-childhood (p < 0.01). Two and nine Mn-associated DMPs were identified in male and female infants, respectively (FDR < 0.05), with two and six persisting in mid-childhood (p < 0.05). All metals except Ba and Pb were associated with ≥ 1 DMR among all infants (Sidak p < 0.05).

No,Prediction,34797422,DNA methylation-based classification of malformations of cortical development in the human brain.,Acta Neuropathol,"Malformations of cortical development (MCD) comprise a broad spectrum of structural brain lesions frequently associated with epilepsy. Disease definition and diagnosis remain challenging and are often prone to arbitrary judgment. Molecular classification of histopathological entities may help rationalize the diagnostic process. We present a retrospective, multi-center analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation from human brain specimens obtained from epilepsy surgery using EPIC 850 K BeadChip arrays. A total of 308 samples were included in the study. In the reference cohort, 239 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples were histopathologically classified as MCD, including 12 major subtype pathologies. They were compared to 15 FFPE samples from surgical non-MCD cortices and 11 FFPE samples from post-mortem non-epilepsy controls. We applied three different statistical approaches to decipher the DNA methylation pattern of histopathological MCD entities, i.e., pairwise comparison, machine learning, and deep learning algorithms. Our deep learning model, which represented a shallow neuronal network, achieved the highest level of accuracy. A test cohort of 43 independent surgical samples from different epilepsy centers was used to test the precision of our DNA methylation-based MCD classifier. All samples from the test cohort were accurately assigned to their disease classes by the algorithm. These data demonstrate DNA methylation-based MCD classification suitability across major histopathological entities amenable to epilepsy surgery and age groups and will help establish an integrated diagnostic classification scheme for epilepsy-associated MCD.© 2021.

Two differentially methylated CpG-sites were associated with AUD in the CN, and 18 in VS (q < 0.05). No epigenome-wide significant CpG-sites were found in BA9, ACC, or PUT. Differentially methylated regions associated with AUD case-/control status (q < 0.05) were found in the CN (n = 6), VS (n = 18), and ACC (n = 1). In the VS, the WGCNA-module showing the strongest association with AUD was enriched for immune-related pathways. This study is the first to analyze methylation differences between AUD cases and controls in multiple brain regions and consists of the largest sample to date. Several novel CpG-sites and regions implicated in AUD were identified, providing a first basis to explore epigenetic correlates of AUD.© 2021. The Author(s)."
Yes,EWAS,34774679,"Blood DNA methylation markers associated with type 2 diabetes, fasting glucose, and HbA1c levels: An epigenome-wide association study in 316 adult twin pairs.",Genomics,"DNA methylation plays an important role in the development and etiology of type 2 diabetes; however, few epigenomic studies have been conducted on twins. Herein, a two-stage study was performed to explore the associations between DNA methylation and type 2 diabetes, fasting plasma glucose, and HbA1c. DNA methylation in 316 twin pairs from the Chinese National Twin Registry (CNTR) was measured using Illumina Infinium BeadChips. In the discovery sample, the results revealed that 63 CpG sites and 6 CpG sites were significantly associated with fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c, respectively. In the replication sample, cg19690313 in TXNIP was associated with both fasting plasma glucose (P = 1.23 × 10-17, FDR < 0.001) and HbA1c (P = 2.29 × 10-18,FDR < 0.001). Furthermore, cg04816311, cg08309687, and cg09249494 may provide new insight in the metabolic mechanism of HbA1c. Our study provides solid evidence that cg19690313 on TXNIP correlates with HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose levels.Copyright © 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
Yes,EWAS,34750344,Association between maternal depression during pregnancy and newborn DNA methylation.,Transl Psychiatry,"Around 15-65% of women globally experience depression during pregnancy, prevalence being particularly high in low- and middle-income countries. Prenatal depression has been associated with adverse birth and child development outcomes. DNA methylation (DNAm) may aid in understanding this association. In this project, we analyzed associations between prenatal depression and DNAm from cord blood from participants of the South African Drakenstein Child Health Study. We examined DNAm in an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of 248 mother-child pairs. DNAm was measured using the Infinium MethylationEPIC (N = 145) and the Infinium HumanMethylation450 (N = 103) arrays. Prenatal depression scores, obtained with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), were analyzed as continuous and dichotomized variables. We used linear robust models to estimate associations between depression and newborn DNAm, adjusted for measured (smoking status, household income, sex, preterm birth, cell type proportions, and genetic principal components) and unmeasured confounding using Cate and Bacon algorithms. Bonferroni correction was used to adjust for multiple testing. DMRcate and dmrff were used to test for differentially methylated regions (DMRs). Differential DNAm was significantly associated with BDI-II variables, in cg16473797 (Δ beta = -1.10E-02, p = 6.87E-08), cg23262030 (Δ beta per BDI-II total IQR = 1.47E-03, p = 1.18E-07), and cg04859497 (Δ beta = -6.42E-02, p = 1.06E-09). Five DMRs were associated with at least two depression variables. Further studies are needed to replicate these findings and investigate their biological impact.© 2021. The Author(s)."
Yes,EWAS,34738878,Epigenome-wide association study of global cortical volumes in generation Scotland: Scottish family health study.,Epigenetics,"A complex interplay of genetic and environmental risk factors influence global brain structural alterations associated with brain health and disease. Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of global brain imaging phenotypes have the potential to reveal the mechanisms of brain health and disease and can lead to better predictive analytics through the development of risk scores.We perform an EWAS of global brain volumes in Generation Scotland using peripherally measured whole blood DNA methylation (DNAm) from two assessments, (i) at baseline recruitment, ~6 years prior to MRI assessment (N = 672) and (ii) concurrent with MRI assessment (N=565). Four CpGs at baseline were associated with global cerebral white matter, total grey matter, and whole-brain volume (Bonferroni p≤7.41×10-8, βrange= -1.46x10-6to 9.59 × 10-7). These CpGs were annotated to genes implicated in brain-related traits, including psychiatric disorders, development, and ageing. We did not find significant associations in the meta-analysis of the EWAS of the two sets concurrent with imaging at the corrected level.These findings reveal global brain structural changes associated with DNAm measured ~6 years previously, indicating a potential role of early DNAm modifications in brain structure. Although concurrent DNAm was not associated with global brain structure, the nominally significant findings identified here present a rationale for future investigation of associations between DNA methylation and structural brain phenotypes in larger population-based samples."
Yes,EWAS,34732242,Skeletal muscle methylome and transcriptome integration reveals profound sex differences related to muscle function and substrate metabolism.,Clin Epigenetics,"Nearly all human complex traits and diseases exhibit some degree of sex differences, with epigenetics being one of the main contributing factors. Various tissues display sex differences in DNA methylation; however, this has not yet been explored in skeletal muscle, despite skeletal muscle being among the tissues with the most transcriptomic sex differences. For the first time, we investigated the effect of sex on autosomal DNA methylation in human skeletal muscle across three independent cohorts (Gene SMART, FUSION, and GSE38291) using a meta-analysis approach, totalling 369 human muscle samples (222 males and 147 females), and integrated this with known sex-biased transcriptomics. We found 10,240 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) at FDR < 0.005, 94% of which were hypomethylated in males, and gene set enrichment analysis revealed that differentially methylated genes were involved in muscle contraction and substrate metabolism. We then investigated biological factors underlying DNA methylation sex differences and found that circulating hormones were not associated with differential methylation at sex-biased DNA methylation loci; however, these sex-specific loci were enriched for binding sites of hormone-related transcription factors (with top TFs including androgen (AR), estrogen (ESR1), and glucocorticoid (NR3C1) receptors). Fibre type proportions were associated with differential methylation across the genome, as well as across 16% of sex-biased DNA methylation loci (FDR < 0.005). Integration of DNA methylomic results with transcriptomic data from the GTEx database and the FUSION cohort revealed 326 autosomal genes that display sex differences at both the epigenome and transcriptome levels. Importantly, transcriptional sex-biased genes were overrepresented among epigenetic sex-biased genes (p value = 4.6e-13), suggesting differential DNA methylation and gene expression between male and female muscle are functionally linked. Finally, we validated expression of three genes with large effect sizes (FOXO3A, ALDH1A1, and GGT7) in the Gene SMART cohort with qPCR. GGT7, involved in antioxidant metabolism, displays male-biased expression as well as lower methylation in males across the three cohorts. In conclusion, we uncovered 8420 genes that exhibit DNA methylation differences between males and females in human skeletal muscle that may modulate mechanisms controlling muscle metabolism and health.© 2021.

Yes,EWAS,34732130,Role of DNA methylation on the association between physical activity and cardiovascular diseases: results from the longitudinal multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort.,BMC Genomics,"The complexity of physical activity (PA) and DNA methylation interaction in the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is rarely simultaneously investigated in one study. We examined the role of DNA methylation on the association between PA and CVD.The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort Exam 5 data with 1065 participants free of CVD were used for final analysis. The quartile categorical total PA variable was created by activity intensity (METs/week). During a median follow-up of 4.0 years, 69 participants developed CVD. Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip was used to provide genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in purified human monocytes (CD14+). We identified 23 candidate DNA methylation loci to be associated with both PA and CVD. We used the structural equation modeling (SEM) approach to test the complex relationships among multiple variables and the roles of mediators. Three of the 23 identified loci (corresponding to genes VPS13D, PIK3CD and VPS45) remained as significant mediators in the final SEM model along with other covariates. Bridged by the three genes, the 2nd PA quartile (β = - 0.959; 95%CI: - 1.554 to - 0.449) and the 3rd PA quartile (β = - 0.944; 95%CI: - 1.628 to - 0.413) showed the greatest inverse associations with CVD development, while the 4th PA quartile had a relatively weaker inverse association (β = - 0.355; 95%CI: - 0.713 to - 0.124).The current study is among the first to simultaneously examine the relationships among PA, DNA methylation, and CVD in a large cohort with long-term exposure. We identified three DNA methylation loci bridged the association between PA and CVD. The function of the identified genes warrants further investigation in the pathogenesis of CVD.© 2021.

Yes,EWAS,34717175,Short- and intermediate-term exposure to ambient fine particulate elements and leukocyte epigenome-wide DNA methylation in older men: the Normative Aging Study.,Environ Int,"Several epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of ambient particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 µm (PM2.5) have been reported. However, EWAS of PM2.5elements (PEs), reflecting different emission sources, are very limited.We performed EWAS of short- and intermediate-term exposure to PM2.5and 13 PEs. We hypothesized that significant changes in DNAm may vary by PM2.5mass and its elements.We repeatedly collected blood samples in the Normative Aging Study and measured leukocyte DNA methylation (DNAm) with the Illumina HumanMethylation450K BeadChip. We collected daily PM2.5and 13 PEs at a fixed central site. To estimate the associations between each PE and DNAm at individual cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites, we incorporated a distributed-lag (0-27 d) term in the setting of median regression with subject-specific intercept and examined cumulative lag associations. We also accounted for selection bias due to loss to follow-up and mortality prior to enrollment. Significantly differentially methylated probes (DMPs) were identified using Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. We further conducted regional and pathway analyses to identify significantly differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and pathways.We included 695 men with 1,266 visits between 1999 and 2013. The subjects had a mean age of 75 years. The significant DMPs, DMRs, and pathways varied by to PM2.5total mass and PEs. For example, PM2.5total mass was associated with 2,717 DMPs and 10,470 DMRs whereas Pb was associated with 3,173 DMPs and 637 DMRs. The identified pathways by PM2.5mass were mostly involved in mood disorders, neuroplasticity, immunity, and inflammation, whereas the pathways associated with motor vehicles (BC, Cu, Pb, and Zn) were related with cardiovascular disease and cancer (e.g., ""PPARs signaling"").PM2.5and PE were associated with methylation changes at multiple probes and along multiple pathways, in ways that varied by particle components.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.
