"301",37872602,"Exploring pathway interactions to detect molecular mechanisms of disease: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.","Orphanet J Rare Dis","22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q11DS) is a genetic disorder characterized by the deletion of adjacent genes at a location specified as q11.2 of chromosome 22, resulting in an array of clinical phenotypes including autistic spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, congenital heart defects, and immune deficiency. Many characteristics of the disorder are known, such as the phenotypic variability of the disease and the biological processes associated with it; however, the exact and systemic molecular mechanisms between the deleted area and its resulting clinical phenotypic expression, for example that of neuropsychiatric diseases, are not yet fully understood.Using previously published transcriptomics data (GEO:GSE59216), we constructed two datasets: one set compares 22q11DS patients experiencing neuropsychiatric diseases versus healthy controls, and the other set 22q11DS patients without neuropsychiatric diseases versus healthy controls. We modified and applied the pathway interaction method, originally proposed by Kelder et al. (2011), on a network created using the WikiPathways pathway repository and the STRING protein-protein interaction database. We identified genes and biological processes that were exclusively associated with the development of neuropsychiatric diseases among the 22q11DS patients. Compared with the 22q11DS patients without neuropsychiatric diseases, patients experiencing neuropsychiatric diseases showed significant overrepresentation of regulated genes involving the natural killer cell function and the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway, with affected genes being closely associated with downregulation of CRK like proto-oncogene adaptor protein. Both the pathway interaction and the pathway overrepresentation analysis observed the disruption of the same biological processes, even though the exact lists of genes collected by the two methods were different.Using the pathway interaction method, we were able to detect a molecular network that could possibly explain the development of neuropsychiatric diseases among the 22q11DS patients. This way, our method was able to complement the pathway overrepresentation analysis, by filling the knowledge gaps on how the affected pathways are linked to the original deletion on chromosome 22. We expect our pathway interaction method could be used for problems with similar contexts, where complex genetic mechanisms need to be identified to explain the resulting phenotypic plasticity.© 2023.

"302",37868035,"Gene expression and RNA splicing explain large proportions of the heritability for complex traits in cattle.","Cell Genom","Many quantitative trait loci (QTLs) are in non-coding regions. Therefore, QTLs are assumed to affect gene regulation. Gene expression and RNA splicing are primary steps of transcription, so DNA variants changing gene expression (eVariants) or RNA splicing (sVariants) are expected to significantly affect phenotypes. We quantify the contribution of eVariants and sVariants detected from 16 tissues (n = 4,725) to 37 traits of ∼120,000 cattle (average magnitude of genetic correlation between traits = 0.13). Analyzed in Bayesian mixture models, averaged across 37 traits,cisandtranseVariants and sVariants detected from 16 tissues jointly explain 69.2% (SE = 0.5%) of heritability, 44% more than expected from the same number of random variants. This 69.2% includes an average of 24% fromtranse-/sVariants (14% more than expected). Averaged across 56 lipidomic traits, multi-tissuecisandtranse-/sVariants also explain 71.5% (SE = 0.3%) of heritability, demonstrating the essential role of proximal and distal regulatory variants in shaping mammalian phenotypes.© 2023 The Author(s)."

"304",37857933,"Systematic differences in discovery of genetic effects on gene expression and complex traits.","Nat Genet","Most signals in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of complex traits implicate noncoding genetic variants with putative gene regulatory effects. However, currently identified regulatory variants, notably expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), explain only a small fraction of GWAS signals. Here, we show that GWAS and cis-eQTL hits are systematically different: eQTLs cluster strongly near transcription start sites, whereas GWAS hits do not. Genes near GWAS hits are enriched in key functional annotations, are under strong selective constraint and have complex regulatory landscapes across different tissue/cell types, whereas genes near eQTLs are depleted of most functional annotations, show relaxed constraint, and have simpler regulatory landscapes. We describe a model to understand these observations, including how natural selection on complex traits hinders discovery of functionally relevant eQTLs. Our results imply that GWAS and eQTL studies are systematically biased toward different types of variant, and support the use of complementary functional approaches alongside the next generation of eQTL studies.© 2023.

"305",37831723,"Investigating trait variability of gene co-expression network architecture in brain by controlling for genomic risk of schizophrenia.","PLoS Genet","The effect of schizophrenia (SCZ) genetic risk on gene expression in brain remains elusive. A popular approach to this problem has been the application of gene co-expression network algorithms (e.g., WGCNA). To improve reliability with this method it is critical to remove unwanted sources of variance while also preserving biological signals of interest. In this WCGNA study of RNA-Seq data from postmortem prefrontal cortex (78 neurotypical donors, EUR ancestry), we tested the effects of SCZ genetic risk on co-expression networks. Specifically, we implemented a novel design in which gene expression was adjusted by linear regression models to preserve or remove variance explained by biological signal of interest (GWAS genomic scores for SCZ risk-(GS-SCZ), and genomic scores- GS of height (GS-Ht) as a negative control), while removing variance explained by covariates of non-interest. We calculated co-expression networks from adjusted expression (GS-SCZ and GS-Ht preserved or removed), and consensus between them (representative of a ""background"" network free of genomic scores effects). We then tested the overlap between GS-SCZ preserved modules and background networks reasoning that modules with reduced overlap would be most affected by GS-SCZ biology. Additionally, we tested these modules for convergence of SCZ risk (i.e., enrichment in PGC3 SCZ GWAS priority genes, enrichment in SCZ risk heritability and relevant biological ontologies. Our results highlight key aspects of GS-SCZ effects on brain co-expression networks, specifically: 1) preserving/removing SCZ genetic risk alters the co-expression modules; 2) biological pathways enriched in modules affected by GS-SCZ implicate processes of transcription, translation and metabolism that converge to influence synaptic transmission; 3) priority PGC3 SCZ GWAS genes and SCZ risk heritability are enriched in modules associated with GS-SCZ effects. Overall, our results indicate that gene co-expression networks that selectively integrate information about genetic risk can reveal novel combinations of biological pathways involved in schizophrenia.Copyright: © 2023 Radulescu et al.

"306",37802917,"Adjustment of spurious correlations in co-expression measurements from RNA-Sequencing data.","Bioinformatics","Gene co-expression measurements are widely used in computational biology to identify coordinated expression patterns across a group of samples. Coordinated expression of genes may indicate that they are controlled by the same transcriptional regulatory program, or involved in common biological processes. Gene co-expression is generally estimated from RNA-Sequencing data, which are commonly normalized to remove technical variability. Here, we demonstrate that certain normalization methods, in particular quantile-based methods, can introduce false-positive associations between genes. These false-positive associations can consequently hamper downstream co-expression network analysis. Quantile-based normalization can, however, be extremely powerful. In particular, when preprocessing large-scale heterogeneous data, quantile-based normalization methods such as smooth quantile normalization can be applied to remove technical variability while maintaining global differences in expression for samples with different biological attributes.We developed SNAIL (Smooth-quantile Normalization Adaptation for the Inference of co-expression Links), a normalization method based on smooth quantile normalization specifically designed for modeling of co-expression measurements. We show that SNAIL avoids formation of false-positive associations in co-expression as well as in downstream network analyses. Using SNAIL, one can avoid arbitrary gene filtering and retain associations to genes that only express in small subgroups of samples. This highlights the method's potential future impact on network modeling and other association-based approaches in large-scale heterogeneous data.The implementation of the SNAIL algorithm and code to reproduce the analyses described in this work can be found in the GitHub repository https://github.com/kuijjerlab/PySNAIL.© The Author(s) 2023.

"307",37780087,NA,NA,"Intraspecific genetic variation in foundation species such as aspen (Populus tremuloidesMichx.) shapes their impact on forest structure and function. Identifying genes underlying ecologically important traits is key to understanding that impact. Previous studies, using single-locus genome-wide association (GWA) analyses to identify candidate genes, have identified fewer genes than anticipated for highly heritable quantitative traits. Mounting evidence suggests that polygenic control of quantitative traits is largely responsible for this ""missing heritability"" phenomenon. Our research characterized the genetic architecture of 30 ecologically important traits using a common garden of aspen through genomic and transcriptomic analyses. A multilocus association model revealed that most traits displayed a highly polygenic architecture, with most variation explained by loci with small effects (likely below the detection levels of single-locus GWA methods). Consistent with a polygenic architecture, our single-locus GWA analyses found only 38 significant SNPs in 22 genes across 15 traits. Next, we used differential expression analysis on a subset of aspen genets with divergent concentrations of salicinoid phenolic glycosides (key defense traits). This complementary method to traditional GWA discovered 1243 differentially expressed genes for a polygenic trait. Soft clustering analysis revealed three gene clusters (241 candidate genes) involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis and regulation. Our work reveals that ecologically important traits governing higher-order community- and ecosystem-level attributes of a foundation forest tree species have complex underlying genetic structures and will require methods beyond traditional GWA analyses to unravel.© 2023 The Authors.

"309",37766997,"Bayesian multivariate genetic analysis improves translational insights.","iScience","While lipid traits are known essential mediators of cardiovascular disease, few approaches have taken advantage of their shared genetic effects. We apply a Bayesian multivariate size estimator, mash, to GWAS of four lipid traits in the Million Veterans Program (MVP) and provide posterior mean and local false sign rates for all effects. These estimates borrow information across traits to improve effect size accuracy. We show that controlling local false sign rates accurately and powerfully identifies replicable genetic associations and that multivariate control furthers the ability to explain complex diseases. Our application yields high concordance between independent datasets, more accurately prioritizes causal genes, and significantly improves polygenic prediction beyond state-of-the-art methods by up to 59% for lipid traits. The use of Bayesian multivariate genetic shrinkage has yet to be applied to human quantitative trait GWAS results, and we present a staged approach to prediction on a polygenic scale.© 2023 The Author(s)."

In this study, we focused on the ideas of the omnigenic model of heritability of complex traits, which assumes that a small number of core genes and a large pool of peripheral genes expressed in disease-relevant tissues contribute to the genetics of complex traits through interconnected networks. We hypothesized that primary immunodeficiency disease (PID) genes may be considered as core genes in severe COVID-19, and their functional partners (FPs) from protein-protein interaction networks may be considered as peripheral near-core genes. We used whole-exome sequencing data from patients aged ≤ 45 years with severe (n= 9) and non-severe COVID-19 (n= 11), and assessed the cumulative contribution of rare high-impact variants to disease severity. In patients with severe COVID-19, an excess of rare high-impact variants was observed at the whole-exome level, but maximal association signals were detected for PID + FP gene subsets among the genes intolerant to LoF variants, haploinsufficient and essential. Our exploratory study may serve as a model for new directions in the research of host genetics in severe COVID-19."

Limited by the availability of experimental data on the consequences of protein interaction, most existing methods focus on building models to predict changes in protein binding affinity. Here, we introduced MIPPI, an end-to-end, interpretable transformer-based deep learning model that learns features directly from sequences by leveraging the interaction data from IMEx. MIPPI was specifically trained to determine the types of variant impact (increasing, decreasing, disrupting, and no effect) on protein-protein interactions. We demonstrate the accuracy of MIPPI and provide interpretation through the analysis of learned attention weights, which exhibit correlations with the amino acids interacting with the variant. Moreover, we showed the practicality of MIPPI in prioritizing de novo mutations associated with complex neurodevelopmental disorders and the potential to determine the pathogenic and driving mutations. Finally, we experimentally validated the functional impact of several variants identified in patients with such disorders. Overall, MIPPI emerges as a versatile, robust, and interpretable model, capable of effectively predicting mutation impacts on protein-protein interactions and facilitating the discovery of clinically actionable variants.Copyright © 2023 Zhe Liu et al."
"312",37695771,"Applying an evolutionary mismatch framework to understand disease susceptibility.","PLoS Biol","Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are on the rise worldwide. Obesity, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes are among a long list of ""lifestyle"" diseases that were rare throughout human history but are now common. The evolutionary mismatch hypothesis posits that humans evolved in environments that radically differ from those we currently experience; consequently, traits that were once advantageous may now be ""mismatched"" and disease causing. At the genetic level, this hypothesis predicts that loci with a history of selection will exhibit ""genotype by environment"" (GxE) interactions, with different health effects in ""ancestral"" versus ""modern"" environments. To identify such loci, we advocate for combining genomic tools in partnership with subsistence-level groups experiencing rapid lifestyle change. In these populations, comparisons of individuals falling on opposite extremes of the ""matched"" to ""mismatched"" spectrum are uniquely possible. More broadly, the work we propose will inform our understanding of environmental and genetic risk factors for NCDs across diverse ancestries and cultures.Copyright: © 2023 Lea et al.

Preclinical and clinical research over the past few decades has delineated certain molecular mechanisms and identified various genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors responsible for the pathophysiology and comorbidities associated with opioid use. Opioid use-induced epigenetic modifications have been identified as one of the important factors that mediate genetic changes in brain regions that control reward and drug-seeking behavior and are also implicated in the development of tolerance. Recently, it has been shown that opioid use results in microbial dysbiosis, leading to gut barrier disruption, which drives systemic inflammation, impacting the perception of pain, the development of analgesic tolerance, and behavioral outcomes. In this review, we highlight the potential role of microbiota and microbial metabolites in mediating the epigenetic modifications induced by opioid use.Copyright © 2023 Kolli and Roy."

Herein, we report that with impaired RTK-Shp2-Ras-Erk signaling, heterogenous hepatocytes form clusters that manage to divide during mouse liver regeneration. These hepatocytes are characterized by upregulated CD133 while negative for other progenitor cell markers. Pharmaceutical inhibition of proliferative signaling also induced CD133 expression in various cancer cell types from multiple animal species, suggesting an inherent and common mechanism of stress response. Super-resolution and electron microscopy localize CD133 on intracellular vesicles that apparently migrate between cells, which we name 'intercellsome.' Isolated CD133+intercellsomes are enriched with mRNAs rather than miRNAs. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals lower intracellular diversity (entropy) of mitogenic mRNAs in Shp2-deficient cells, which may be remedied by intercellular mRNA exchanges between CD133+cells. CD133-deficient cells are more sensitive to proliferative signal inhibition in livers and intestinal organoids. These data suggest a mechanism of intercellular communication to compensate for intracellular signal deficit in various cell types.© 2023, Kaneko et al."
"317",37662219,"Cell Fate Programming by Transcription Factors and Epigenetic Machinery in Stomatal Development.","bioRxiv","The development of multi-cellular organisms requires coordinated changes in gene expression that are often mediated by the interaction between transcription factors (TFs) and their corresponding cis-regulatory elements (CREs). During development and differentiation, the accessibility of CREs is dynamically modulated by the epigenome. How the epigenome, CREs and TFs together exert control over cell fate commitment remains to be fully understood. In theArabidopsisleaf epidermis, meristemoids undergo a series of stereotyped cell divisions, then switch fate to commit to stomatal differentiation. Newly created or reanalyzed scRNA-seq and ChIP-seq data confirm that stomatal development involves distinctive phases of transcriptional regulation and that differentially regulated genes are bound by the stomatal basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TFs. Targets of the bHLHs often reside in repressive chromatin before activation. MNase-seq evidence further suggests that the repressive state can be overcome and remodeled upon activation by specific stomatal bHLHs. We propose that chromatin remodeling is mediated through the recruitment of a set of physical interactors that we identified through proximity labeling - the ATPase-dependent chromatin remodeling SWI/SNF complex and the histone acetyltransferase HAC1. The bHLHs and chromatin remodelers localize to overlapping genomic regions in a hierarchical order. Furthermore, plants with stage-specific knock-down of the SWI/SNF components or HAC1 fail to activate specific bHLH targets and display stomatal development defects. Together these data converge on a model for how stomatal TFs and epigenetic machinery cooperatively regulate transcription and chromatin remodeling during progressive fate specification."

Fisetin is known to be cardioprotective against I/R, but its underlying epigenetic mode of action is not known and is addressed in the present study. Male Wistar rats were subjected to I/R by using the Langendorff perfusion system. Fisetin (20 mg/kg; i.p.) was administered before I/R induction, followed by the measurement of cardiac injury, hemodynamics, physiological indices, the differential expression of genes that regulate DNA methylation, and the function of mitochondria were performed. Fisetin administered I/R rat heart significantly reduced the global DNA hypermethylation and infarct size with an improved physiological recovery, measured via RPP (81%) and LVDP (82%) from the I/R control. Additionally, we noted decreased expression of the DNMT1 gene by 35% and increased expression of the TET1, TET2, and TET3 genes in fisetin-treated I/R rat hearts. Molecular docking analysis data reveals that the fisetin inhibits DNMT1 at the substrate binding site with minimum binding energy (- 8.2 kcal/mol) compared to the DNMT1 inhibitor, 5-azacytidine. Moreover, fisetin-treated I/R heart reversed the expression of the I/R-linked declined expression of bioenergetics genes (MT-ND1, MT-ND2, MT-ND4, MT-Cyt B, MT-COX1, MT-COX2, MT-ATP6), mitochondrial fission gene (Fis1), replication control genes PGC-1α, POLG, and TFAM to near-normal level. Based on the above findings, we demonstrated that fisetin possesses the ability to modulate the expression of different mitochondrial genes via influencing the global DNA methylation in cardiac tissue, which contributes significantly to the improved contractile function and thereby renders cardioprotection against I/R.© 2023.

Therefore, we examined if in-utero exposure to maternal smoking was associated with infant DNA methylation (DNAm) of cytosine-phosphate-guanine dinucleotides (CpG sites) in the arginine vasopressin receptor 1AAVPR1agene. TheAVPR1agene encodes a receptor that interacts with the arginine vasopressin hormone and may influence physiological stress regulation, blood pressure, and child development. (2) Methods: Fifty-two infants were included in this cohort study. Multivariable linear models were used to examine the effect of in-utero exposure to maternal smoking on the mean DNAm of CpG sites located atAVPR1a.(3) Results: After adjusting the model for substance use, infants with in-utero exposure to maternal smoking had a reduction in DNAm atAVPR1aCpG sites by -0.02 (95% CI -0.03, -0.01) at one month of age. In conclusion, in-utero exposure to tobacco smoke can lead to differential patterns of DNAm ofAVPR1aamong infants. Conclusions: Future studies are needed to identify how gene expression in response to early environmental exposures contributes to health outcomes."

Human experts are skilled at identifying strong explicit patterns in small samples, while deep learning models excel at detecting implicit weak patterns in large datasets. Biologists have described the sequence patterns of promoters via transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs). However, the flanking sequences of cis-regulatory elements, have long been overlooked and often arbitrarily decided in promoter design. To address this limitation, we introduce DeepSEED, an AI-aided framework that efficiently designs synthetic promoters by combining expert knowledge with deep learning techniques. DeepSEED has demonstrated success in improving the properties of Escherichia coli constitutive, IPTG-inducible, and mammalian cell doxycycline (Dox)-inducible promoters. Furthermore, our results show that DeepSEED captures the implicit features in flanking sequences, such as k-mer frequencies and DNA shape features, which are crucial for determining promoter properties.© 2023.

Such genes would provide a novel opportunity for better pain management, as their epigenetic profile could be targeted for the treatment of chronic pain or used as an indication of vulnerability for prevention strategies. Here, we investigated the epigenetic profile of the gene Fkbp5 for this potential, using targeted bisulphite sequencing in rodent pre-clinical models of chronic and latent hypersensitive states.The Fkbp5 promoter DNA methylation (DNAm) signature in the CNS was significantly different between models of persistent pain, and there was a significant correlation between CNS and peripheral blood Fkbp5 DNAm, indicating that further exploration of Fkbp5 promoter DNAm as an indicator of chronic pain pathogenic origin is warranted. We also found that maternal separation, which promotes the persistency of inflammatory pain in adulthood, was accompanied by long-lasting reduction in Fkbp5 DNAm, suggesting that Fkbp5 DNAm profile may indicate the increased vulnerability to chronic pain in individuals exposed to trauma in early life.Overall, our data demonstrate that the Fkbp5 promoter DNAm landscape brings novel insight into the differing pathogenic origins of chronic pain, may be able to stratify patients and predict the susceptibility to chronic pain.© 2023.

The loss of this capacity for axonal regeneration is emphasized following traumatic brain injury, which is a major cause of disability and death among adults in the US. We have previously shown the intrinsic capacity of magnocellular neurons within the supraoptic nucleus to undergo axonal regeneration following unilateral axotomization in an age-dependent manner. The aim of this research was to determine the age-dependent molecular mechanisms that may underlie this phenomenon. As such, we characterized the transcriptome and DNA methylome of the supraoptic nucleus in uninjured 35-day old rats and 125-day old rats. Our data indicates the downregulation of a large number of axonogenesis related transcripts in 125-day old rats compared to 35-day old rats. Specifically, several semaphorin and ephrin genes were downregulated, as well as growth factors including FGF's, insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Differential methylation analysis indicates enrichment of biological processes involved in axonogenesis and axon guidance. Conversely, we observed a robust and specific upregulation of MHCI related transcripts. This may involve the activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factor complex as motif analysis of differentially methylated regions indicate enrichment of AP-1 binding sites in hypomethylated regions.

To investigate these associations, Labrador Retrievers were phenotyped as ACL rupture case or controls and for coat color and were single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyped. After filtering, ~ 697 K SNPs were analyzed using GEMMA and mvBIMBAM for multivariate association. Functional annotation clustering analysis with DAVID was performed on candidate genes. A large 8 Mb region on chromosome 5 that included ACSF3, as well as 32 additional SNPs, met genome-wide significance at P < 6.07E-7 or Log10(BF) = 3.0 for GEMMA and mvBIMBAM, respectively. On chromosome 23, SNPs were located within or near PCCB and MSL2. On chromosome 30, a SNP was located within IGDCC3. SNPs associated with coat color were also located within ADAM9, FAM109B, SULT1C4, RTDR1, BCR, and RGS7. DZIP1L was associated with ACL rupture. Several significant SNPs on chromosomes 2, 3, 7, 24, and 26 were located within uncharacterized regions or long non-coding RNA sequences. This study validates associations with the previous ACL rupture candidate genes ACSF3 and DZIP1L and identifies novel candidate genes.

DE ARGs were enriched by Metascape online tools. According to GEPIA2 database, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TNFSF10) was identified as a closely related factor and prognostic marker of SKCM. Then the correlation analysis of clinicopathological characteristics between TNFSF10 and SKCM was completed by several online tools such as TISCH, HPA, BEST and qRT-PCR. Subsequently, we investigated TNFSF10 related functions and signal pathways with LinkedOmics online tool, and immune infiltration using Assistant for Clinical Bioinformatics online tool. Furthermore, correlation analysis between TNFSF10 expression and immunotherapy response was performed by TIDE algorithm and BEST online tool. And Kaplan-Meier Plotter was used to assessing the prognosis of SKCM patients receiving immunotherapy. Finally, the correlation analysis among TNFSF10 methylation, TNFSF10 expression and patient prognosis was completed by the DiseaseMeth version 2.0, UCSC XENA and qRT-PCR. ARGs are DE in SKCM and participate in the ERBB signaling pathway, as well as the processing and presentation of antigens. Moreover, TNFSF10's expression along with methylation expression were significantly associated with the prognosis. Low expression of TNFSF10 was associated with malignant clinicopathological features, lower immune signal activity and lower immunocytes abundance in patients with SKCM. As an ARG, TNFSF10 has a potential capacity in predicting the prognosis of SKCM patients, meanwhile, may be a novel immunotherapy marker for SKCM.© The author(s)."

A total of 13.6% had POF during admission. The AUC for NLR48 in predicting mortality risk and SAP was 0.81 and 0.785, superior to NLR0, CRP48, and mCTSI but inferior to BISAP and SOFA scores. The NLR48/NLR0 ratio did not add significantly to the accuracy. NLR0 and NLR48 performed poorly for mortality prediction in severe forms and in patients admitted to the ICU. NLR48 has good accuracy in our study for predicting death risk in biliary and alcoholic acute pancreatitis but not in hypertriglyceridemic acute pancreatitis.NLR48 was a good indicator in predicting mortality risk and severe forms in all patients with acute pancreatitis, but not of death in SAP and in patients admitted to ICU, with good accuracy for predicting death risk in biliary and alcoholic acute pancreatitis but not in hypertriglyceridemic acute pancreatitis.© 2023 Cazacu et al."

Of the included patients 185 patients received a final diagnosis of PJI and 177 were classed as aseptic. Established criteria (ICM 2018) were employed to define PJI. Included in the analysis are differential white cell counts, C-Reactive Protein (CRP), Synovial Leukocyte Count, Synovial Alpha-defensin ELISA and Synovial Leukocyte esterase activity. Receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves were calculated for each of the available diagnostic tests together with the corresponding area under the curve values (AUC). Youden's index was utilized to identify the optimal diagnostic threshold point for the NLR and LMR. Other diagnostic tests were evaluated as per the threshold values previously defined in the literature and specified in the ICM criteria.Using Youden's Index to identify the optimal NLR cut-off within our cohort we established a value of 2.93. This yielded a sensitivity of 0.60 and specificity of 0.64. The area under the curve (AUC) of a receiving operator characteristics (ROC) curve was 0.625. Regarding the LMR the results demonstrate similar findings; a positive correlation with a diagnosis of infection but poor sensitivity and specificity. The AUC for LMR was 0.633 and was not superior to NLR (P = 0.753).There is a significant correlation between higher Neutrophil-Lymphocyte and Lymphocyte-Monocyte ratios, and a diagnosis of PJI. The sensitivity and specificity of this calculation is poor and the does not add value to the diagnostic algorithm for PJI.Level III Retrospective Cohort analysis.© 2023.

In the 19th century, a connection was made between inflammation and cancer, with inflammation recognized as a malignancy hallmark. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), calculated from a complete blood count, is a simple and accessible biomarker of inflammation status. NLR has also been proven to be a prognostic factor for various medical conditions, including mortality classification in cardiac patients, infectious diseases, postoperative complications, and inflammatory states. In this narrative review, we aim to assess the prognostic potential of NLR in cancer. We will review recent studies that have evaluated the association between NLR and various malignancies. The results of this review will help to further understand the role of NLR in cancer prognosis and inform future research directions. With the increasing incidence of cancer, it is important to identify reliable and accessible prognostic markers to improve patient outcomes. The study of NLR in cancer may provide valuable insights into the development and progression of cancer and inform clinical decision-making.Copyright © 2023 Heshmat-Ghahdarijani, Sarmadi, Heidari, Falahati Marvasti, Neshat and Raeisi."
"329",37846240,"Role of Hematological Parameters in the Grading of COVID-19 and a Model to Predict the Outcome in Inpatients.","Cureus","Introduction Human coronaviruses, identified in the 1960s, are known culprits of respiratory infections. Classified into alpha, beta, gamma, and delta subgroups, these viruses have the capacity to transition from animal reservoirs to causing severe respiratory ailments in humans. Notable outbreaks like the 2003 severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS) epidemic and the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic underscore the recurring emergence of novel coronaviruses with severe human infection potential. COVID-19, driven by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has rapidly become a leading global cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome. Immune system disruptions and cytokine imbalances contribute to severe cases, necessitating early diagnosis and precise severity assessment. Methodology This retrospective cross-sectional study encompassed 211 COVID-19 patients admitted to AIIMS Patna from May to July 2020. Clinical and hematological parameters, including neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, red and white blood cell counts, platelet count, C-reactive protein (CRP), serum ferritin, and d-dimer, were meticulously recorded. Patients were categorized into non-severe and severe groups using the National Early Warning Score (NEWS) 2. Results  Our findings underscore the pivotal role of hematological markers in gauging COVID-19 severity. Notably, markers such as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), derived NLR, lymphocyte monocyte ratio, platelet lymphocyte ratio, d-dimer, CRP, and serum ferritin exhibited notable elevation in severe cases. Survival analysis further established the predictive potential of these markers in assessing disease progression and mortality risk. We advocate for the integration of these markers into existing severity assessment frameworks to foster objective clinical evaluations. Conclusion In conclusion, our study unravels the intricate connection between COVID-19 severity and hematological parameters. We emphasize the early warning capabilities of NLR, derived NLR, platelet lymphocyte ratio, and other markers in predicting disease progression. This research underscores the imperative need to incorporate hematological markers into the evaluation of COVID-19 severity, thereby providing invaluable insights for enhancing clinical practice and patient outcomes.Copyright © 2023, Kumar et al."

However, simple and effective diagnostic and screening methods for GST remain a great challenge at home and abroad. This study aimed to build a GST early warning system based on a combination of machine learning algorithms and routine blood, biochemical and tumour marker indicators.In total, 697 complete samples were collected from four hospitals in Gansu Province, including 42 blood indicators from 318 pretreatment GST patients, 180 samples of gastric polyps and 199 healthy individuals. In this study, three algorithms, gradient boosting machine (GBM), random forest (RF), and logistic regression (LR), were chosen to build GST prediction models for comparison. The performance and stability of the models were evaluated using two different validation techniques: 5-fold cross-validation and external validation. The DeLong test assesses significant differences in AUC values by comparing different ROC curves, the variance and covariance of the AUC value.The AUC values of both the GBM and RF models were higher than those of the LR model, and this difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The GBM model was considered to be the optimal model, as a larger area was enclosed by the ROC curve, and the axes indicated robust model classification performance according to the accepted model discriminant. Finally, the integration of 8 top-ranked blood indices was proven to be able to distinguish GST from gastric polyps and healthy people with sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve of 0.941, 0.807 and 0.951 for the cross-validation set, respectively.The GBM demonstrated powerful classification performance and was able to rapidly distinguish GST patients from gastric polyps and healthy individuals. This identification system not only provides an innovative strategy for the diagnosis of GST but also enables the exploration of hidden associations between blood parameters and GST for subsequent studies on the prevention and disease surveillance management of GST.

Methods A prospective analytical cross-sectional observational study was conducted at the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS), Ranchi, Jharkhand, India. A total of 100 patients with DM who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were included in the study. A pre-tested and semi-structured questionnaire was given to the patients. IBM SPSS software version 26 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) and MedCalc trial version 20.114 (MedCalc Software Ltd., Ostend, Belgium) were used for data analysis. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the association of the NLR with microvascular complications. Results In our study, the male-to-female ratio was 1.78:1 (male: 64 (n)%, female: 36 (n)%). The mean age of our study population was 56.28 ± 13.24 years. Of 58 patients with microvascular complications, 34 had a high NLR, and 24 patients had a normal NLR. Of 42 patients without microvascular complications, only 14 had a high NLR, and the remaining 28 patients had a normal NLR (p = 0.012). Logistic regression was performed to analyze the association between the NLR and microvascular complications, which demonstrated a significant association (odds ratio (OR): 2.833, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.238-6.481; p = 0.013). Conclusions Our study demonstrated the higher odds of having microvascular complications among diabetics with a high NLR compared with non-diabetics. Therefore, the NLR may be used as a measure of microvascular complications in the diabetic population.Copyright © 2023, Mahajan et al."

The study enrolled patients aged ≥18 years who were diagnosed with tonsillitis with or without DNI during the study period. The NLR of patients without DNI was 6.1 ± 5.03, and the NLR of patients with acute tonsillitis with DNI was 8.0 ± 5.67, showing significant differences. The rate of admission in the general wards (GWs) and ICUs was significantly higher in patients with DNI, and the length of hospital stay was also significantly longer in patients with DNI. Older age, male, lower body temperature, C-reactive protein, and NLR were significant independent risk factors for DNI in patients with tonsillitis. The cutoff value for predicting DNI in patients with body temperature <37.5 was 3.09.

Little is known about how the post-release health of rehabilitated koalas compares to non-rescued resident koalas. We evaluated health parameters in rehabilitated koalas and resident koalas in burnt and unburnt habitat in southern New South Wales, Australia. Health checks were undertaken within six weeks of fire (rehabilitated group), 5-9 months post-fire and 12-16 months post-fire. Body condition improved significantly over time in rehabilitated koalas, with similar condition between all groups at 12-16 months. Rehabilitated koalas therefore gained body condition at similar rates to koalas who remained and survived in the wild. The prevalence ofChlamydia pecorumwas also similar between groups and timepoints, suggesting wildfire and rehabilitation did not exacerbate disease in this population. While there was some variation in measured serum biochemistry and haematology parameters between groups and timepoints, most were within normal reference ranges. Our findings show that koalas were generally healthy at the time of release and when recaptured nine months later. Landscapes in the Monaro region exhibiting a mosaic of burn severity can support koalas, and rehabilitated koala health is not compromised by returning them to burnt habitats 4-6 months post-fire."

This study investigates the NETosis markers with the assessment of selected parameters of inflammation and coagulation system in patients with thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms in the pre-and postop period undergoing t-Branch stent-graft implantation. The study included 20 patients with thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms. Three markers double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), and citrullinated H3 histones (Cit-H3) were tested at three-time points from patients' blood. The parameters of NETosis, inflammation, and coagulation system were examined in the preoperative period (within 24 h before surgery) and in the postoperative period (on the 3rd and 5th postoperative day). Free-circulating DNA (cfDNA) was isolated from the blood using the MagMAXTM Cell-Free DNA Extraction Kit. Double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) were then quantified using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit and the Qubit ssDNA Assay Kit. Cit-H3 concentration was determined by enzyme immunoassay ELISA (Cayman). The results revealed the significance of NETs secretion in response to the complex processes after stent-graft implantation. All NET markers increased shortly after surgery, with histones being the first to return to preoperative levels. The lack of normalization of dsDNA and ssDNA levels to preoperative levels by the last postoperative blood collection demonstrates NETs reorganization. The increase in the number of neutrophils was not related to the expansion of postoperative NETosis. The study reveals a new marker of NETosis, ssDNA, that has not been studied so far. The implantation of a stent graft in a patient with TAAA triggers an inflammatory response manifested by an increase in inflammatory parameters. One of the hallmarks of inflammation is the activation of neutrophil extracellular traps.© 2023 Michalska, Grochowiecki, Wyczałkowska-Tomasik, Pączek, Jakimowicz, Cacko, Jama, Stec, Sikorska, Nazarewski and Gałązka."

The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and C-reactive protein (CRP) are new, simple, and cost-effective predictors for prognosis. The predictive value of NLR as an inflammatory marker can predict post-operative pain caused by inflammatory pathways secondary to surgical trauma. CRP is also the most sensitive and specific biomarker of inflammation whereas PLR was also recently considered a possible marker for inflammation which may further contribute to pain and sequelae. Thus, anesthetists can make decisions about the amount, time, and type of analgesic to use based on preoperative values of these parameters to provide maximum postoperative pain control and facilitate early rehabilitation. Thus, the current study was conducted to determine the relationship between CRP, NLR, and PLR levels and the intensity of pain in patients following total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA).A total of 105 patients scheduled for THA and TKA fulfilling the study's inclusion criteria were enrolled. Inclusion criteria of the study were all the patients giving written consent, ASA Grade I-III, patients between 18 and 90 years who were scheduled for elective lower extremity TJA, and all the patients who remained admitted until stitches were removed. Patients were given intrathecal 15 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine via 25G atraumatic spinal needle in the L3-L4 interspace. The recorded data were demographic characteristics, preexisting comorbidities, number of blood transfusions, and operation time, postoperative analgesics given, duration of hospital stay, time of mobility, pain scoring as per visual analog scale (VAS) scoring system with an aim to establish a relationship between pre- and post-operative (Days 3 & 5) CRP, NLR, and PLR with post-operative pain after THA and TKA.The present study demonstrated a significant correlation (p < 0.002) between preoperative and postoperative NLR with pain after TJA whereas PLR and CRP did not show any significant relationship with post-operative pain after THA and TKA. A significantly higher NLR ratio was observed for patients on all the periods of observation (pre-op., Day 3, and Day 5). Pre-op. and Day 5 NLR of patients who required transfusion were significantly higher than those who did not require transfusion and patients with higher NLR values could be mobilized significantly later and had significantly higher duration of hospital stay. The correlation of CRP levels and PLR levels at different time intervals did not show a significant correlation with Day 3 and Day 5 pain scores.The present study demonstrated a significant correlation between preoperative and postoperative NLR with pain after TJA.Copyright © 2023, Rathee et al."

These investigations often employ data normalization techniques more typically used for analysis of data originating from solid tissues, which largely operate under the general assumption that specimens have similar transcriptome composition. However, this assumption may be violated when working with data generated from whole blood, which is more cellularly dynamic, leading to potential confounds. In this study, we used next generation sequencing in combination with flow cytometry to assess the influence of donor leukocyte counts on the transcriptional composition of whole blood specimens sampled from a cohort of 138 human subjects, and then subsequently examined the effect of four frequently used data normalization approaches on our ability to detect inter-specimen biological variance, using the flow cytometry data to benchmark each specimens true cellular and molecular identity. Whole blood samples originating from donors with differing leukocyte counts exhibited dramatic differences in both genome-wide distributions of transcript abundance and gene-level expression patterns. Consequently, three of the normalization strategies we tested, including median ratio (MRN), trimmed mean of m-values (TMM), and quantile normalization, noticeably masked the true biological structure of the data and impaired our ability to detect true interspecimen differences in mRNA levels. The only strategy that improved our ability to detect true biological variance was simple scaling of read counts by sequencing depth, which unlike the aforementioned approaches, makes no assumptions regarding transcriptome composition.© 2023.

This study was designed to develop a comprehensive clinical outcome prediction score for Chinese patients with CVT, integrating key prognostic markers to furnish an overall prognosis.Participants were selected from the CCC cohort, a multicenter study encompassing 26 tertiary hospitals across mainland China. Between January 2021 and May 2022, 170 patients with CVT were prospectively recruited. Potential prognostic markers were extracted from the CCC database and subsequently analyzed.Age, diastolic blood pressure (DBP), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) emerged as significant prognostic markers for CVT after a multivariate logistic analysis. Specific cut-off values were identified: Age > 27.5 years, DBP > 79.5 mmHg, NLR > 6.6, and NSE >16.5 ng/mL. The points assigned were: one each for age and NSE level, two for DBP, and three for NLR, based on the adjusted odds ratio. A positive correlation was found between the baseline CVT outcome score and the mRS at six months' follow-up. A CVT outcome score of 3.5 served as an effective cut-off value for predicting CVT clinical outcomes. Further analysis revealed that patients with CVT outcome scores > 3 exhibited significantly higher mRS scores than those with scores ≤ 3.This study led to the development of the CVT outcome score, consisting of age, DBP, NLR, and NSE level, specifically for Chinese patients with CVT. The baseline CVT outcome score positively correlated with the mRS score at the six-month follow-up. A CVT outcome score of > 3 serves as a reliable indicator to identify patients at a higher risk of unfavorable clinical outcomes. These patients may benefit from additional care and early interventions to avert potential deterioration.© 2023 Li et al."

Survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazards regression model. Data was also processed through Coxnet (a regularized Cox regression model), Random Survival Forest (RSF), Survival Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Survival Gradient Boosting models, which included pre-processing, variable selection, imputation of missing data, training and cross-validation of the models. The cross-validated concordance index (CI) was used as an evaluation metric and to determine the best performing model.Kaplan-Meier curves for 5-year survival time showed survival probability of 80% for recipient survival and 82% for graft survival. The 5-year HCC recurrence was observed in 19% of patients. The best predictive accuracy was observed in the RSF model with CI of 0.72, followed by the Survival SVM model (CI 0.70). Overall ML models outperform the Cox regression model with respect to their limitations. Random Forest analysis provided several relevant outcome predictors: alpha fetoprotein (AFP), donor C-reactive protein (CRP), recipient age and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR). Cox multivariate analysis showed similarities with RSF models in identifying detrimental variables. Some variables such as donor age and number of transarterial chemoembolization treatments (TACE) were pointed out, but these were not influential in our RSF model.Using ML methods in addition to classical statistical analysis, it is possible to develop sufficient prognostic models, which, compared to established risk scores, could help us quantify survival probability and make changes in organ utilization.2023 Annals of Translational Medicine.

We aimed to examine whether birth weight and body mass index (BMI) mediate the effect of MSDP on BP in children. The study included 14,713 children aged 8 to 15 years from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys from 1999 to 2018. General third-variable models were used to examine the mediating effects of birth weight and BMI on the association of MSDP with BP. A total of 1928 (13.1%) children were exposed to MSDP. MSDP was associated with reduced birth weight (p < 0.001), increased BMI (p < 0.001), and elevated systolic BP (p = 0.005). MSDP was not associated with systolic BP after adjustment for birth weight and BMI z-score (p = 0.875), with 95.0% of the effect of MSDP on BP mediated by birth weight (39.1%) and BMI (55.9%). In conclusion, lower birth weight and increased obesity measures mediate the adverse effects of MSDP on BP in children. These findings provide novel mechanistic insight into the adverse effect of MSDP on BP in children and have implications for preventing hypertension in later life.© 2023.

"342",37858046,"Cross-tissue patterns of DNA hypomethylation reveal genetically distinct histories of cell development.","BMC Genomics","Establishment of DNA methylation (DNAme) patterns is essential for balanced multi-lineage cellular differentiation, but exactly how these patterns drive cellular phenotypes is unclear. While > 80% of CpG sites are stably methylated, tens of thousands of discrete CpG loci form hypomethylated regions (HMRs). Because they lack DNAme, HMRs are considered transcriptionally permissive, but not all HMRs actively regulate genes. Unlike promoter HMRs, a subset of non-coding HMRs is cell type-specific and enriched for tissue-specific gene regulatory functions. Our data further argues not only that HMR establishment is an important step in enforcing cell identity, but also that cross-cell type and spatial HMR patterns are functionally informative of gene regulation.To understand the significance of non-coding HMRs, we systematically dissected HMR patterns across diverse human cell types and developmental timepoints, including embryonic, fetal, and adult tissues. Unsupervised clustering of 126,104 distinct HMRs revealed that levels of HMR specificity reflects a developmental hierarchy supported by enrichment of stage-specific transcription factors and gene ontologies. Using a pseudo-time course of development from embryonic stem cells to adult stem and mature hematopoietic cells, we find that most HMRs observed in differentiated cells (~ 60%) are established at early developmental stages and accumulate as development progresses. HMRs that arise during differentiation frequently (~ 35%) establish near existing HMRs (≤ 6 kb away), leading to the formation of HMR clusters associated with stronger enhancer activity. Using SNP-based partitioned heritability from GWAS summary statistics across diverse traits and clinical lab values, we discovered that genetic contribution to trait heritability is enriched within HMRs. Moreover, the contribution of heritability to cell-relevant traits increases with both increasing HMR specificity and HMR clustering, supporting the role of distinct HMR subsets in regulating normal cell function.Our results demonstrate that the entire HMR repertoire within a cell-type, rather than just the cell type-specific HMRs, stores information that is key to understanding and predicting cellular phenotypes. Ultimately, these data provide novel insights into how DNA hypo-methylation provides genetically distinct historical records of a cell's journey through development, highlighting HMRs as functionally distinct from other epigenomic annotations.© 2023.

Transcriptional dysregulation due to alterations in KRAS and MYC affects initiation, development, and survival of this tumor type. Using patient-derived xenografts of KRAS- and MYC-driven pancreatic carcinoma, we show that coinhibition of topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) and bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) synergistically induces tumor regression by targeting promoter pause release. Comparing the nascent transcriptome with the recruitment of elongation and termination factors, we found that coinhibition of TOP1 and BRD4 disrupts recruitment of transcription termination factors. Thus, RNA polymerases transcribe downstream of genes for hundreds of kilobases leading to readthrough transcription. This occurs during replication, perturbing replisome progression and inducing DNA damage. The synergistic effect of TOP1 + BRD4 inhibition is specific to cancer cells leaving normal cells unaffected, highlighting the tumor's vulnerability to transcriptional defects.

Whereas the role of DNA methylation on the silencing of transposons and repetitive DNA is well understood, gene body methylation is not associated with transcriptional repression, and its biological importance remains unclear.We report a newly discovered type of GbM in plants, which is under constitutive addition and removal by dynamic methylation modifiers in all cells, including the germline. Methylation at Dynamic GbM genes is removed by the DRDD demethylation pathway and added by an unknown source of de novo methylation, most likely the maintenance methyltransferase MET1. We show that the Dynamic GbM state is present at homologous genes across divergent lineages spanning over 100 million years, indicating evolutionary conservation. We demonstrate that Dynamic GbM is tightly associated with the presence of a promoter or regulatory chromatin state within the gene body, in contrast to other gene body methylated genes. We find Dynamic GbM is associated with enhanced gene expression plasticity across development and diverse physiological conditions, whereas stably methylated GbM genes exhibit reduced plasticity. Dynamic GbM genes exhibit reduced dynamic range in drdd mutants, indicating a causal link between DNA demethylation and enhanced gene expression plasticity.We propose a new model for GbM in regulating gene expression plasticity, including a novel type of GbM in which increased gene expression plasticity is associated with the activity of DNA methylation writers and erasers and the enrichment of a regulatory chromatin state.© 2023.

"345",37777550,NA,NA,"The influence of aging on intestinal stem cells and their niche can explain underlying causes for perturbation in their function observed during aging. Molecular mechanisms for such a decrease in the functionality of intestinal stem cells during aging remain largely undetermined. Using transcriptome-wide approaches, our study demonstrates that aging intestinal stem cells strongly upregulate antigen presenting pathway genes and over-express secretory lineage marker genes resulting in lineage skewed differentiation into the secretory lineage and strong upregulation of MHC class II antigens in the aged intestinal epithelium. Mechanistically, we identified an increase in proinflammatory cells in the lamina propria as the main source of elevated interferon gamma (IFNγ) in the aged intestine, that leads to the induction of Stat1 activity in intestinal stem cells thus priming the aberrant differentiation and elevated antigen presentation in epithelial cells. Of note, systemic inhibition of IFNγ-signaling completely reverses these aging phenotypes and reinstalls regenerative capacity of the aged intestinal epithelium.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."

The mammalian SNF2 family ATPase HELLS and its plant ortholog DDM1 are critical for maintaining 5mC. Mutations in HELLS, its activator CDCA7, and the de novo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B, cause immunodeficiency-centromeric instability-facial anomalies (ICF) syndrome, a genetic disorder associated with the loss of DNA methylation. We here examine the coevolution of CDCA7, HELLS and DNMTs. While DNMT3, the maintenance DNA methyltransferase DNMT1, HELLS, and CDCA7 are all highly conserved in vertebrates and green plants, they are frequently co-lost in other evolutionary clades. The presence-absence patterns of these genes are not random; almost all CDCA7 harboring eukaryote species also have HELLS and DNMT1 (or another maintenance methyltransferase, DNMT5). Coevolution of presence-absence patterns (CoPAP) analysis in Ecdysozoa further indicates coevolutionary linkages among CDCA7, HELLS, DNMT1 and its activator UHRF1. We hypothesize that CDCA7 becomes dispensable in species that lost HELLS or DNA methylation, and/or the loss of CDCA7 triggers the replacement of DNA methylation by other chromatin regulation mechanisms. Our study suggests that a unique specialized role of CDCA7 in HELLS-dependent DNA methylation maintenance is broadly inherited from the last eukaryotic common ancestor.© 2023, Funabiki et al."
"347",37761931,NA,NA,"5-methylcytosine (5mC) is one of the most important epigenetic modifications. Its increased occurrence in regulatory sequences of genes, such as promoters and enhancers, is associated with the inhibition of their expression. Methylation patterns are not stable but are sensitive to factors such as the environment, diet, and age. In the present study, we investigated the effects of fungicide miconazole, both alone and in combination with the insecticide Mospilan 20SP, on the methylation status of bovineGSTP1,GSTA4, andAChEgenes in bovine lymphocytes cultured in vitro. The methylation-specific PCR technique was used for the objectives of this study. We found that miconazole alone at concentrations of 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 25, and 50 µg/mL after 24 h exposure probably did not induce changes in methylation for all three genes analysed. The same results were found for the combination of pesticides at 24 h exposure and the following concentrations for each of them: 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5, and 12.5 µg/mL. Thus, we can conclude that the fungicide miconazole alone, as well as in combination with the insecticide Mospilan 20SP, was unlikely to cause changes to the methylation of bovineGSTP1,GSTA4, andAChEgenes."
"348",37754245,NA,NA,"Depression and anxiety are common mental disorders that often occur together. Stress is an important risk factor for both disorders, affecting pathophysiological processes through epigenetic changes that mediate gene-environment interactions. In this study, we explored two proposed models about the dynamic nature of DNA methylation in anxiety and depression: a stable change, in which DNA methylation accumulates over time as a function of the duration of clinical symptoms of anxiety and depression, or a flexible change, in which DNA methylation correlates with the acute severity of clinical symptoms. Symptom severity was assessed using clinical questionnaires for anxiety and depression (BDI-II, IDS-C, and HAM-A), and the current episode and the total lifetime symptom duration was obtained from patients' medical records. Peripheral blood DNA methylation levels were determined for theBDNF,COMT, andSLC6A4genes. We found a significant negative correlation betweenCOMT_1amplicon methylation and acute symptom scores, with BDI-II (R(22) = 0.190,p= 0.033), IDS-C (R(22) = 0.199,p= 0.029), and HAM-A (R(22) = 0.231,p= 0.018) all showing a similar degree of correlation. Our results suggest that DNA methylation follows flexible dynamics, with methylation levels closely associated with acute clinical presentation rather than with the duration of anxiety and depression. These results provide important insights into the dynamic nature of DNA methylation in anxiety and affective disorders and contribute to our understanding of the complex interplay between stress, epigenetics, and individual phenotype."

At heterochromatin-euchromatin borders, regulation of accessibility not only depends on the delimitation of heterochromatin but may also involve interplays with nearby genes and their transcriptional activity, or alternatively on histone modifiers, chromatin barrier insulators, and more global demarcation of chromosomes into 3D compartmentalized domains and topological-associating domain (TADs). Here, we show that depletion of H3K36 di- or tri-methyl histone methyltransferases dMes-4/NSD or Hypb/dSet2 induces reproducible increasing levels of H3K27me3 at heterochromatin borders including in nearby promoters, thereby repressing hundreds of genes. Furthermore, dMes-4/NSD influences genes demarcated by insulators and TAD borders, within chromatin hubs, unlike transcription-coupled action of Hypb/dSet2 that protects genes independently of TADs. Insulator mutants recapitulate the increase of H3K27me3 upon dMes-4/NSD depletion unlike Hypb/dSet2. Hi-C data demonstrate how dMes-4/NSD blocks propagation of long-range interactions onto active regions. Our data highlight distinct mechanisms protecting genes from H3K27me3 silencing, highlighting a direct influence of H3K36me on repressive TADs.© 2023 Depierre et al."
"350",37672574,NA,NA,"The insulator model explains the workings of theH19andIgf2imprinted domain in the soma, where insulation of theIgf2promoter from its enhancers occurs by CTCF in the maternally inherited unmethylated chromosome but not the paternally inherited methylated allele. The molecular mechanism that targets paternal methylation imprint establishment to the imprinting control region (ICR) in the male germline is unknown. We tested the function of prospermatogonia-specific broad low-level transcription in this process using mouse genetics. Paternal imprint establishment was abnormal when transcription was stopped at the entry point to the ICR. The germline epimutation persisted into the paternal allele of the soma, resulting in reducedIgf2in fetal organs and reduced fetal growth, consistent with the insulator model and insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2)'s role as fetal growth factor. These results collectively support the role of broad low-level transcription through theH19/Igf2ICR in the establishment of its paternal methylation imprint in the male germ line, with implications for Silver-Russell syndrome."

We validated these clusters using immunohistochemistry, methylation immune inference and segmentation analysis of tissue images. We report shared biology of these immune clusters within and across cancer types, and characterization of specific immune cell frequencies as well as T- and B-cell repertoires. We found no associations between immune infiltration levels and tumour mutational burden, although molecular cancer entities were enriched within specific immune clusters.Given the heterogeneity of immune infiltration within pedNST, our findings suggest personalized immunogenomic profiling is needed to guide selection of immunotherapeutic strategies.© 2023.

We examined mindful eating in breast cancer survivors following a 9-week, multidisciplinary virtual teaching kitchen intervention called Survivors Overcoming and Achieving Resiliency (SOAR). SOAR engaged participants through weekly cooking classes that also taught multiple domains of mindfulness. Participants (n= 102) were breast cancer survivors and completed the Mindful Eating Questionnaire (MEQ) prior to and after completion of the intervention. Linear regression analyses examined relationships between the aspects of mindful eating and body mass index (BMI). Wilcoxon (paired) rank sum tests evaluated the significance of the change in the MEQ total sum and subscales scores. A total of 102 participants completed both the pre- and post-intervention surveys. The mean change between the pre- and post-SOAR MEQ summary scores was 0.12 (sd = 0.30; Wilcoxonp-value = 0.0003). All MEQ subscale scores significantly increased with the exception of the distraction subscale. The MEQ summary scores increased for participants across both BMI stratifications. The SOAR teaching kitchen represents one of the first interventions that is tailored for breast cancer survivors and combines behavioral strategies from mindful eating training to nutritional knowledge and culinary medicine pedagogy in a virtual teaching kitchen. Further research is needed to examine whether mindful eating practices among cancer survivors result in sustainable healthy eating behaviors and food choices consistent with the cancer risk reduction guidelines."
"353",37823001,"The contribution to policies of an exposome-based approach to childhood obesity.","Exposome","Childhood obesity is an increasingly severe public health problem, with a prospective impact on health. We propose an exposome approach to identify actionable risk factors for this condition. Our assumption is that relationships between external exposures and outcomes such as rapid growth, overweight, or obesity in children can be better understood through a ""meet-in-the-middle"" model. This is based on a combination of external and internal exposome-based approaches, that is, the study of multiple exposures (in our case, dietary patterns) and molecular pathways (metabolomics and epigenetics). This may strengthen causal reasoning by identifying intermediate markers that are associated with both exposures and outcomes. Our biomarker-based studies in the STOP consortium suggest (in several ways, including mediation analysis) that branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) could be mediators of the effect of dietary risk factors on childhood overweight/obesity. This is consistent with intervention and animal studies showing that higher intake of BCAAs has a positive impact on body composition, glycemia, and satiety. Concerning food, of particular concern is the trend of increasing intake of ultra-processed food (UPF), including among children. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the impact of UPF on obesity and overweight, including nutrient intake (particularly proteins), changes in appetite, or the role of additives. Research from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children cohort has shown a relationship between UPF intake and trajectories in childhood adiposity, while UPF was related to lower blood levels of BCAAs. We suggest that an exposome-based approach can help strengthening causal reasoning and support policies. Intake of UPF in children should be restricted to prevent obesity."

Nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 1 (NFE2L1, also known as Nrf1), a master regulator of cellular metabolic homeostasis and numerous stress responses, has been found to function as a critical driver in BAT thermogenic adaption to cold or obesity by providing proteometabolic quality control. Our recent studies using adipocyte-specific Nfe2l1 knockout [Nfe2l1(f)-KO] mice demonstrated that NFE2L1-dependent transcription of lipolytic genes is crucial for white adipose tissue (WAT) homeostasis and plasticity. In the present study, we found that Nfe2l1(f)-KO mice develop an age-dependent whitening and shrinking of BAT, with signatures of down-regulation of proteasome, impaired mitochondrial function, reduced thermogenesis, pro-inflammation, and elevated regulatory cell death (RCD). Mechanistic studies revealed that deficiency of Nfe2l1 in brown adipocytes (BAC) primarily results in down-regulation of lipolytic genes, which decelerates lipolysis, making BAC unable to fuel thermogenesis. These changes lead to BAC hypertrophy, inflammation-associated RCD, and consequently cold intolerance. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing of BAT reveals that deficiency of Nfe2l1 induces significant transcriptomic changes leading to aberrant expression of a variety of genes involved in lipid metabolism, proteasome, mitochondrial stress, inflammatory responses, and inflammation-related RCD in distinct subpopulations of BAC. Taken together, our study demonstrated that NFE2L1 serves as a vital transcriptional regulator that controls the lipid metabolic homeostasis in BAC, which in turn determines the metabolic dynamics, cellular heterogeneity and subsequently cell fates in BAT.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of these phenotypes have typically involved separate fetal and maternal scans, however, this approach may be inefficient as it does not utilize the information shared across the individual GWAS. In this manuscript we investigate the performance of three strategies to detect loci in maternal and fetal GWAS of the same trait: (i) the traditional strategy of analysing maternal and fetal GWAS separately; (ii) a novel two degree of freedom test which combines information from maternal and fetal GWAS; and (iii) a novel one degree of freedom test where signals from maternal and fetal GWAS are meta-analysed together conditional on the estimated sample overlap. We demonstrate through a combination of analytical formulae and data simulation that the optimal strategy depends on the extent of sample overlap/relatedness between the maternal and fetal GWAS, the correlation between own and offspring phenotypes, whether loci jointly exhibit fetal and maternal effects, and if so, whether these effects are directionally concordant. We apply our methods to summary results statistics from a recent GWAS meta-analysis of birth weight from deCODE, the UK Biobank and the Early Growth Genetics (EGG) consortium. Both the two degree of freedom (213 loci) and meta-analytic approach (226 loci) dramatically increase the number of robustly associated genetic loci for birth weight relative to separately analysing the scans (183 loci). Our best strategy identifies an additional 62 novel loci compared to the most recent published meta-analysis of birth weight and implicates both known and new biological pathways in the aetiology of the trait. We implement our methods in the online DINGO (Direct andINdirect effects analysis ofGenetic lOci) software package, which allows users to perform one and/or two degree of freedom tests easily and computationally efficiently across the genome. We conclude that whilst the novel two degree of freedom test may be particularly useful for the analysis of certain perinatal phenotypes where many loci exhibit discordant maternal and fetal genetic effects, for most phenotypes, a simple meta-analytic strategy is likely to perform best, particularly in situations where maternal and fetal GWAS only partially overlap."
"357",37817069,"New statistical selection method for pleiotropic variants associated with both quantitative and qualitative traits.","BMC Bioinformatics","Identification of pleiotropic variants associated with multiple phenotypic traits has received increasing attention in genetic association studies. Overlapping genetic associations from multiple traits help to detect weak genetic associations missed by single-trait analyses. Many statistical methods were developed to identify pleiotropic variants with most of them being limited to quantitative traits when pleiotropic effects on both quantitative and qualitative traits have been observed. This is a statistically challenging problem because there does not exist an appropriate multivariate distribution to model both quantitative and qualitative data together. Alternatively, meta-analysis methods can be applied, which basically integrate summary statistics of individual variants associated with either a quantitative or a qualitative trait without accounting for correlations among genetic variants.We propose a new statistical selection method based on a unified selection score quantifying how a genetic variant, i.e., a pleiotropic variant associates with both quantitative and qualitative traits. In our extensive simulation studies where various types of pleiotropic effects on both quantitative and qualitative traits were considered, we demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms the existing meta-analysis methods in terms of true positive selection. We also applied the proposed method to a peanut dataset with 6 quantitative and 2 qualitative traits, and a cowpea dataset with 2 quantitative and 6 qualitative traits. We were able to detect some potentially pleiotropic variants missed by the existing methods in both analyses.The proposed method is able to locate pleiotropic variants associated with both quantitative and qualitative traits.

Epidemiological studies have linked chronic arsenic exposure to an increased risk of several cancers, cardiovascular disease, central nervous system neuropathies, and genotoxic as well as immunotoxic effects. In addition to the induction of oxidative stress and inhibition of DNA repair processes, epigenetic effects, including altered DNA methylation patterns resulting in aberrant gene expression, may contribute to carcinogenicity. However, the underlying mechanisms by which chronic micromolar concentrations of arsenite affect the methylation status of DNA are not fully understood. In this study, human HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells were treated with 0.5-10 μM sodium arsenite for 24 h, 10, or 20 days. During these periods, the effects on global DNA methylation, cell cycle phase distribution, and gene expression were investigated. While no impact on DNA methylation was seen after short-term exposure, global hypomethylation was observed at both long-term exposure periods, with concomitant induction of the DNA methyltransferase genesDNMT1andDNMT3B, whileDNMT3Awas slightly down-regulated. Pronounced time- and concentration-dependent effects were also seen in the case of genes involved in DNA damage response and repair, inflammation, oxidative stress response, and metal homeostasis. These results suggest that chronic low-dose arsenite exposure can lead to global hypomethylation. As an underlying mechanism, the consistent down-regulation of DNA methyltransferase genes could be excluded; alternatively, interactions at the protein level could play an important role."

We assessed the individual and joint associations of each smoking exposure measure and maternal OWO with childhood OWO using multinomial logistic regressions. We used nested logistic regressions to investigate the childhood OWO prediction performance when adding maternal and cord plasma biomarkers as input covariates on top of self-reported data.Our results demonstrated thatin uterocigarette smoking exposure defined by self-report and by maternal or cord metabolites was consistently associated with increased risk of long-term child OWO. Children with cord hydroxycotinine in the fourth quartile (vs.first quartile) had 1.66 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-2.66) times the odds for overweight and 1.57 (95% CI 1.05-2.36) times the odds for obesity. The combined effect of maternal OWO and smoking on offspring risk of obesity is 3.66 (95% CI 2.37-5.67) if using self-reported smoking. Adding maternal and cord plasma biomarker information to self-reported data improved the prediction accuracy of long-term child OWO risk.This longitudinal birth cohort study of US BIPOC underscored the role of maternal smoking as an obesogen for offspring OWO risk.

C-reactive protein (CRP) is an inflammatory marker found to be elevated in those conditions. Omega-3 fatty acids work against inflammation and lower CRP levels in obese individuals. This study compared high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) in adult obesity and central obesity in Indonesia based on omega-3 fatty acid intake using Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS) 5 data. Secondary data from household questionnaires were obtained from the IFLS 5 online database. Data from 3152 subjects were used; 76.65% of the subjects were female, with a mean age of 45.27 ± 15.77 years. Subjects were classified into five modified categories of obesity and central obesity based on body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC). Omega-3 fatty acid intake was categorized into ""low"" and ""adequate"" based on dietary recommendations from the Mediterranean Diet Foundation (2011). There is a significant difference in hs-CRP based on modified obesity categories (p< 0.05). There was no significant difference in hs-CRP between low and adequate omega-3 intake (p> 0.05). These data suggest that hs-CRP is related to overweight, obesity, and central obesity. Meanwhile, omega-3 fatty acids are unrelated to hs-CRP. Further studies are needed to confirm these results."

While it is known that H3.3K36M changes the cellular epigenetic landscape, it remains unclear how it affects the dynamics of gene expression. Here, we use a synthetic reporter to measure the effect of H3.3K36M on silencing and epigenetic memory after recruitment of KRAB: a member of the largest class of human repressors, commonly used in synthetic biology, and associated with H3K9me3. We find that H3.3K36M, which decreases H3K36 methylation, leads to a decrease in epigenetic memory and promoter methylation weeks after KRAB release. We propose a new model for establishment and maintenance of epigenetic memory, where H3K36 methylation is necessary to convert H3K9me3 domains into DNA methylation for stable epigenetic memory. Our quantitative model can inform oncogenic mechanisms and guide development of epigenetic editing tools."

Some genes escape XCI, including crucial tumour suppressors. Cancer susceptibility can be influenced by the variability in the genes that escape XCI. The mechanisms of XCI dysregulation remain poorly understood in complex diseases, including cancer. Using publicly available breast cancer next-generation sequencing data, we show that the status of the major tumour suppressorTP53from Chromosome 17 is highly associated with the genomic integrity of the inactive X (Xi) and the active X (Xa) chromosomes. Our quantification of XCI and XCI escape demonstrates that aberrant XCI is linked to poor survival. We derived prognostic gene expression signatures associated with either large deletions of Xi; large amplifications of Xa; or abnormal X-methylation. Our findings expose a novel insight into female cancer risks, beyond those associated with the standard molecular subtypes."

Here, we investigated the sex differences in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of RCC and explored a promising combination drug regimen to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy.Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from four published datasets were analyzed to investigate the sex differences in RCC patients, and tumor tissues were collected to validate the sex differences using multiplex immunofluorescence (MxIF) and flow cytometry (FCM). The function of the androgen-androgen receptor axis in sex differences was explored in vivo and in vitro experiments.Our analysis of scRNA-seq data from 220,156 cells, as well as MxIF and FCM assays, revealed that CD8+T-cells infiltrated highly in the TME of male RCC, but were mostly in an exhausted and dysfunctional state. In vitro and in vivo experiments indicated that the dysfunction and exhaustion of CD8+T-cells in male TME were induced by androgen. Clinically, higher serum androgen was significantly associated with a worse prognosis in male RCC patients receiving immunotherapy. Androgen receptor inhibitors could activate tumor-infiltrating CD8+T-cells and enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy of RCC in vivo.Our study delineated the difference in TME between male and female patients with RCC, and demonstrated that the androgen-androgen receptor axis plays an important role in immunosuppression in male RCC. Our findings suggest that androgen receptor inhibitors in combination with immunotherapy may be a promising treatment option for male RCC patients.© 2023.

Stratifying individuals misaligned to a genetic predictor based on common variants may be important for follow-up studies that aim to identify alternative causal factors. Using genome-wide imputed genetic data, we aimed to classify 158,951 unrelated individuals from the UK Biobank as either concordant or deviating from two well-measured phenotypes. We first applied our methods to standing height: our primary analysis classified 244 individuals (0.15%) as misaligned to their genetically predicted height. We show that these individuals are enriched for self-reporting being shorter or taller than average at age 10, diagnosed congenital malformations, and rare loss-of-function variants in genes previously catalogued as causal for growth disorders. Secondly, we apply our methods to LDL cholesterol (LDL-C). We classified 156 (0.12%) individuals as misaligned to their genetically predicted LDL-C and show that these individuals were enriched for both clinically actionable cardiovascular risk factors and rare genetic variants in genes previously shown to be involved in metabolic processes. Individuals whose LDL-C was higher than expected based on the genetic predictor were also at higher risk of developing coronary artery disease and type-two diabetes, even after adjustment for measured LDL-C, BMI and age, suggesting upward deviation from genetically predicted LDL-C is indicative of generally poor health. Our results remained broadly consistent when performing sensitivity analysis based on a variety of parametric and non-parametric methods to define individuals deviating from polygenic expectation. Our analyses demonstrate the potential importance of quantitatively identifying individuals for further follow-up based on deviation from genetic predictions.Copyright: © 2023 Hawkes et al.

Using genetic data, this study elucidates biological mechanisms, key risk factors, and causal pathways underlying the comorbidity. We show that CVDs share a large proportion of their genetic risk factors with MDD. Multivariate genome-wide association analysis of the shared genetic liability between MDD and CVD revealed seven novel loci and distinct patterns of tissue and brain cell-type enrichments, suggesting a role for the thalamus. Part of the genetic overlap was explained by shared inflammatory, metabolic, and psychosocial risk factors. Finally, we found support for causal effects of genetic liability to MDD on CVD risk, but not vice versa, and demonstrated that the causal effects are partly explained by metabolic and psychosocial factors. The distinct signature of MDD-CVD comorbidity aligns with the idea of an immunometabolic sub-type of MDD more strongly associated with CVD than overall MDD. In summary, we identify plausible biological mechanisms underlying MDD-CVD comorbidity, as well as key modifiable risk factors for prevention of CVD in individuals with MDD."

Classic PKAN is distinguished from atypical PKAN by stiffness, dystonia, dysarthria, and choreoathetosis. Pigmentary retinal degeneration is a widespread cause of classic PKAN. Atypical PKAN is distinguished by a later onset (>10 years), noticeable speech abnormalities, psychological disorders, and slower disease development. Studies designed to support various PKAN therapeutic strategies have highlighted the intricacy of coenzyme A (CoA) metabolism and the limitations of our present understanding of disease causation. Therefore, improvements in our knowledge of the causes and therapy of PKAN may have ramifications for our comprehension of other, more prevalent diseases. They may also shed fresh light on the physiological significance of CoA, a cofactor essential for the operation of several cellular metabolic processes. The existence of low but considerable PANK2 expression, which can be elevated in some mutations, provides necessary information that can justify using a hefty dose of pantothenate as a treatment. A more effective therapeutic approach can be achieved by comparing the effects of various currently available pharmacological alternatives on the pathophysiological alterations in fibroblasts and neuronal cells obtained from PKAN patients. The objective of this study is to educate and inform people about PKAN disease conditions such as treatment, diagnosis, and complications. These cell models will also help evaluate the effectiveness of future medicinal innovations.

"372",37895830,NA,NA,"The term neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) brings together a broad set of progressive and disabling neurological genetic disorders in which iron is deposited preferentially in certain areas of the brain. Among NBIA disorders, the most frequent subtype is pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN) caused by pathologic variants in thePANK2gene codifying the enzyme pantothenate kinase 2 (PANK2). To date, there are no effective treatments to stop the progression of these diseases. This review discusses the utility of patient-derived cell models as a valuable tool for the identification of pharmacological or natural compounds for implementing polytarget precision medicine in PKAN. Recently, several studies have described that PKAN patient-derived fibroblasts present the main pathological features associated with the disease including intracellular iron overload. Interestingly, treatment of mutant cell cultures with various supplements such as pantothenate, pantethine, vitamin E, omega 3, α-lipoic acid L-carnitine or thiamine, improved all pathophysiological alterations in PKAN fibroblasts with residual expression of the PANK2 enzyme. The information provided by pharmacological screenings in patient-derived cellular models can help optimize therapeutic strategies in individual PKAN patients."

These cells express mature neuronal markers, including MAP-2, NeuN, synapsin, and tau. However, most studies were limited in sample size and primarily focused on autosomal dominant familial AD (FAD) rather than the more common sporadic forms of AD. Several studies indicated that iNs derived from FAD fibroblasts exhibited abnormal amyloid-β metabolism, a characteristic feature of AD in humans. Additionally, elevated levels of hyperphosphorylated tau, another hallmark of AD, were reported in some studies.Although only a limited number of small-scale studies are currently available, AD patient-derived iNs hold promise as a valuable model for investigating AD pathogenesis. Future research should aim to conduct larger studies, particularly focusing on sporadic AD cases, to enhance the clinical relevance of the findings for the broader AD patient population. Moreover, these cells can be utilized in screening potential novel treatments for AD."

Hypomethylation of cg05575921 in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor (AHRR) gene is associated with in utero tobacco smoke exposure. In this study, we evaluated whether AHRR hypomethylation mediates the association between maternal smoking and metabolic dysfunction in children.We assessed metabolic dysfunction using liver fat content (LFC), serum, and clinical data in children aged 7-12 years (n=78) followed since birth. Maternal smoking was self-reported at 12 weeks gestation. Methylation was measured by means of pyrosequencing at 3 sequential CpG sites, including cg05575921, at birth and at ages 7-12. Regression models were used to evaluate whether AHRR methylation mediated the association between maternal smoking and child metabolic dysfunction.Average AHRR methylation at birth was significantly higher among children of nonsmoking mothers compared with children of mothers who smoked (69.8% ± 4.4% vs. 63.5% ± 5.5, p=0.0006). AHRR hypomethylation at birth was associated with higher liver fat content (p=0.01), triglycerides (p=0.01), and alanine aminotransferase levels (p=0.03), and lower HDL cholesterol (p=0.01) in childhood. AHRR hypomethylation significantly mediated associations between maternal smoking and liver fat content (indirect effect=0.213, p=0.018), triglycerides (indirect effect=0.297, p=0.044), and HDL cholesterol (indirect effect = -0.413, p=0.007). AHRR methylation in childhood (n=78) was no longer significantly associated with prenatal smoke exposure or child metabolic parameters (p>0.05).AHRR hypomethylation significantly mediates the association between prenatal tobacco smoke exposure and features of childhood metabolic dysfunction, despite the lack of persistent hypomethylation of AHRR into childhood.

Thirteen epigenetic clocks were used in our analysis and were highly correlated with one another. A higher psychological resilience score was associated with slower DNA methylation age acceleration for the majority of epigenetic clocks after multivariable adjustment.

Although clinical risk-defining genomic alterations exist in neuroblastomas, the mutational processes involved in their generation remain largely unclear. By examining the topography and mutational signatures derived from all variant classes, we identified co-occurring mutational footprints, which we termed mutational scenarios. We demonstrate that clinical neuroblastoma heterogeneity is associated with differences in the mutational processes driving these scenarios, linking risk-defining pathognomonic variants to distinct molecular processes. Whereas high-riskMYCN-amplified neuroblastomas were characterized by signs of replication slippage and stress, homologous recombination-associated signatures defined high-risk non-MYCN-amplified patients. Non-high-risk neuroblastomas were marked by footprints of chromosome mis-segregation and TOP1 mutational activity. Furthermore, analysis of subclonal mutations uncovered differential activity of these processes through neuroblastoma evolution. Thus, clinical heterogeneity of neuroblastoma patients can be linked to differences in the mutational processes that are active in their tumors.© 2023 The Author(s)."

Here, we shed light on the spectrum and etiology of mutagenesis across mammals by quantifying mutational sequence context biases using polymorphism data from thirteen species of mice, apes, bears, wolves, and cetaceans. After normalizing the mutation spectrum for reference genome accessibility and k-mer content, we use the Mantel test to deduce that mutation spectrum divergence is highly correlated with genetic divergence between species, whereas life history traits like reproductive age are weaker predictors of mutation spectrum divergence. Potential bioinformatic confounders are only weakly related to a small set of mutation spectrum features. We find that clock-like mutational signatures previously inferred from human cancers cannot explain the phylogenetic signal exhibited by the mammalian mutation spectrum, despite the ability of these signatures to fit each species' 3-mer spectrum with high cosine similarity. In contrast, parental aging signatures inferred from human de novo mutation data appear to explain much of the 1-mer spectrum's phylogenetic signal in combination with a novel mutational signature. We posit that future models purporting to explain the etiology of mammalian mutagenesis need to capture the fact that more closely related species have more similar mutation spectra; a model that fits each marginal spectrum with high cosine similarity is not guaranteed to capture this hierarchy of mutation spectrum variation among species.© The Author(s) 2023.

Multiomics analyses were adopted to explore the potential mechanisms, discover novel treatment targets, and assess the sensitivities of immunotherapy and chemotherapy.Results:Five TME-associated genes, namely,FERMT1,CARD9,IL20RB,MET, andMMP3, were identified and a risk score formula constructed. Next, their mRNA expressions were verified in cancer and normal pancreatic cells. Multiple algorithms confirmed that the risk model displayed a reliable ability of prognosis prediction and was an independent prognostic factor, indicating that high-risk patients had poor outcomes. Immunocyte infiltration, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and single-cell analysis all showed a strong relationship between immune mechanism and low-risk samples. The risk score could predict the sensitivity of immunotherapy and some chemotherapy regimens, which included oxaliplatin and irinotecan.

We used publicly available data from the Cancer Genome Atlas to evaluate the associations between the activity of the mutational signatures and various survival endpoints in six types of urological cancers after adjusting for established prognostic factors. The predictive power of the signatures was evaluated with dynamic area under curve models. In addition, links between mutational signature activities and differences in gene expression patterns were analysed. APOBEC-related signature SBS2 was associated with improved overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) in bladder carcinomas in the multivariate analysis, while clock-like signature SBS1 predicted shortened DSS and progression-free interval (PFI) in clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCC). In papillary renal cell carcinomas (pRCC), SBS45 was a predictor of improved outcomes, and APOBEC-related SBS13 was a predictor of worse outcomes. Gene expression analyses revealed various enriched pathways between the low- and high-signature groups. Interestingly, in both the ccRCC and pRCC cohorts, the genes of several members of the melanoma antigen (MAGE) family were highly upregulated in the signatures, which predicted poor outcomes, and downregulated in signatures, which were associated with improved survival. To summarize, SBS signatures provide substantial prognostic value compared with just the traditional prognostic factors in certain cancer types. APOBEC-related SBS2 and SBS13 seem to provide robust prognostic information for particular urological cancers, maybe driven by the expression of specific groups of genes, including the MAGE gene family.Copyright © 2023.

Our analysis of whole-genome sequencing shows that in line with other healthy organs, the healthy breast during the reproduction years accumulates mutations with age, with the rate of accumulation in the epithelium of 15.24 ± 5 mutations/year. Both epithelial and stromal compartments contain mutations in breast-specific driver genes, indicative of subsequent positive selection. Parity- and age-associated differences are evident in the mammary epithelium, partly explaining the observed difference in breast cancer risk amongst women of different childbearing age. Parity is associated with an age-dependent increase in the clone size of mutated epithelial cells, suggesting that older first-time mothers have a higher probability of accumulating oncogenic events in the epithelium compared to younger mothers or nulliparous women. In conclusion, we describe the reference genome of the healthy female human breast during reproductive years and provide evidence of how parity affects the genomic landscape of the mammary gland.© 2023.

The diagnoses of CMM, which included the copresence of type 2 diabetes (T2D), ischemic heart disease, and stroke, were obtained from first occurrence fields provided by the UK Biobank, which included data from primary care, hospital inpatient record, self-reported medical condition, and death registers. The PA intensity was assessed by the proportion of vigorous PA (VPA) to moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA). Multistate models were used to evaluate the effect of PA intensity on the dynamic progression of CMM. The first model (model A) included 5 transitions, namely free of cardiometabolic disease (CMD) to first occurrence of CMD (FCMD), free of CMD to death, FCMD to CMM, FCMD to mortality, and CMM to mortality. The other model (model B) used specific CMD, namely T2D, ischemic heart disease, and stroke, instead of FCMD and included 11 transitions in this study.The mean age of the included participants (N=359,773) was 55.82 (SD 8.12) years at baseline, and 54.55% (196,271/359,773) of the participants were female. Compared with the participants with no VPA, participants with intensity levels of >0.75 to <1 for VPA to MVPA had a 13% and 27% lower risk of transition from free of CMD to FCMD (hazard ratio [HR] 0.87, 95% CI 0.83-0.91) and mortality (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.66-0.79) in model A, respectively. The HR for the participants with no moderate PA was 0.82 (95% CI 0.73-0.92) compared with no VPA. There was a substantially protective effect of higher PA intensity on the transitions from free of CMD to T2D and from T2D to mortality, which reveals the importance of PA intensity for the transitions of T2D. More PA and greater intensity had a synergistic effect on decreasing the risk of the transitions from free of CMD to FCMD and mortality. Male participants, younger adults, adults with a higher BMI, current or previous smokers, and excessive alcohol drinkers could obtain more benefits from higher PA intensity for the lower risk of at least 1 transition from free of CMD, then to CMM, and finally to mortality.This study suggests that higher PA intensity is an effective measure for preventing CMM and mortality in the early period of CMM development. Relevant interventions related to higher PA intensity should be conducted.©Bao-Peng Liu, Jia-Hui Zhu, Li-Peng Wan, Zhen-Yu Zhao, Xinting Wang, Cun-Xian Jia.

However, it is unclear how chromatin structure changes during silencing and epigenetic memory formation. We measured gene expression and chromatin structure in single cells after recruitment and release of repressors at a reporter gene. Chromatin structure is heterogeneous, with open and compact conformations present in both active and silent states. Recruitment of repressors associated with epigenetic memory produces chromatin compaction across 10-20 kilobases, while reversible silencing does not cause compaction at this scale. Chromatin compaction is inherited, but changes molecularly over time from histone methylation (H3K9me3) to DNA methylation. The level of compaction at the end of silencing quantitatively predicts epigenetic memory weeks later. Similarly, chromatin compaction at the Nanog locus predicts the degree of stem-cell fate commitment. These findings suggest that the chromatin state across tens of kilobases, beyond the gene itself, is important for epigenetic memory formation."

DNA methylation and post-translational modifications of histone proteins influence gene expression during plant developmental stages and under stress conditions, including cold and heat stress. While short-term modifications are common, some modifications may persist and result in stress memory that can be inherited by subsequent generations. Understanding the mechanisms of epigenomes responding to stress and the factors that trigger stress memory is crucial for developing climate-resilient agriculture, but such an integrated view is currently limited. This review focuses on the plant epigenetic stress memory during cold and heat stress.

Here we report SHIELD (Site-specific Heterochromatin Insertion of Elements at Lamina-associated Domains), a platform tailored for the high-throughput screening of barrier-type DNA elements in human cells. SHIELD takes advantage of the high specificity of serine integrase at heterochromatin, and exploits the natural heterochromatin spreading inside lamina-associated domains (LADs) for the discovery of potent barrier elements. We adopt SHIELD to evaluate the barrier activity of 1000 DNA elements in a high-throughput manner and identify 8 candidates with barrier activities comparable to the core region of cHS4 element in human HCT116 cells.

"388",37693600,NA,NA,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the 6th leading cause of death in the US. It is established that neuroinflammation contributes to the synaptic loss, neuronal death, and symptomatic decline of AD patients. Accumulating evidence suggests a critical role for microglia, innate immune phagocytes of the brain. For instance, microglia release proinflammatory products such as IL-1β which is highly implicated in AD pathobiology. The mechanisms underlying the transition of microglia to proinflammatory promoters of AD remain largely unknown. To address this gap, we performed Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS) to profile global DNA methylation changes in human AD brains compared to no disease controls. We identified differential DNA methylation of CASPASE-4 (CASP4), which when expressed, can be involved in generation of IL-1β and is predominantly expressed in immune cells. DNA upstream of the CASP4 transcription start site was hypomethylated in human AD brains, which was correlated with increased expression of CASP4. Furthermore, microglia from a mouse model of AD (5xFAD) express increased levels of CASP4 compared to wild-type (WT) mice. To study the role of CASP4 in AD, we developed a novel mouse model of AD lacking the mouse ortholog of CASP4, CASP11, which is encoded by mouseCaspase-4(5xFAD/Casp4-/-). The expression of CASP11 was associated with increased accumulation of pathologic protein aggregate amyloid-β (Aβ) and increased microglial production of IL-1β in 5xFAD mice. Utilizing RNA sequencing, we determined that CASP11 promotes unique transcriptomic phenotypes in 5xFAD mouse brains, including alterations of neuroinflammatory and chemokine signaling pathways. Notably,in vitro, CASP11 promoted generation of IL-1β from macrophages in response to cytosolic Aβ through cleavage of downstream effector Gasdermin D (G SDMD). We describe a role for CASP11 and GSDMD in the generation of IL-1β in response to Aβ and the progression of pathologic inflammation in AD. Overall, our results demonstrate that overexpression of CASP4 due to differential methylation in AD microglia contributes to the progression of AD pathobiology, thus identifying CASP4 as a potential target for immunotherapies for the treatment of AD."

Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data resources can help identify causal genes of the GWAS signals, but it can be difficult to find an eQTL that reflects the disease state because most eQTL data are obtained from normal healthy subjects.We performed a blood eQTL analysis using transcriptomic and genotypic data from 433 Korean asthma patients. To identify asthma-related genes, we carried out colocalization, Summary-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) analysis, and Transcriptome-Wide Association Study (TWAS) using the results of asthma GWASs and eQTL data. In addition, we compared the results of disease eQTL data and asthma-related genes with two normal blood eQTL data from Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project and a Japanese study.We identified 340,274 cis-eQTL and 2,875 eGenes from asthmatic eQTL analysis. We compared the disease eQTL results with GTEx and a Japanese study and found that 64.1% of the 2,875 eGenes overlapped with the GTEx eGenes and 39.0% with the Japanese eGenes. Following the integrated analysis of the asthmatic eQTL data with asthma GWASs, using colocalization and SMR methods, we identified 15 asthma-related genes specific to the Korean asthmatic eQTL data.We provided Korean asthmatic cis-eQTL data and identified asthma-related genes by integrating them with GWAS data. In addition, we suggested these asthma-related genes as therapeutic targets for asthma. We envisage that our findings will contribute to understanding the etiological mechanisms of asthma and provide novel therapeutic targets.© 2023. BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature."

However, the downstream impact of these variants and the molecular mechanisms connecting transcription variation to disease risk are not well understood.We quantitated ribosome occupancy in prefrontal cortex samples of the BrainGVEX cohort. Together with transcriptomics and proteomics data from the same cohort, we performed cis-Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) mapping and identified 3,253 expression QTLs (eQTLs), 1,344 ribosome occupancy QTLs (rQTLs), and 657 protein QTLs (pQTLs) out of 7,458 genes quantitated in all three omics types from 185 samples. Of the eQTLs identified, only 34% have their effects propagated to the protein level. Further analysis on the effect size of eQTLs showed clear post-transcriptional attenuation of eQTL effects.To investigate the biological relevance of the attenuated eQTLs, we identified 70 expression-specific QTLs (esQTLs), 51 ribosome-occupancy-specific QTLs (rsQTLs), and 107 protein-specific QTLs (psQTLs). Five of these omics-specific QTLs showed strong colocalization with SCZ GWAS signals, three of them are esQTLs. Using S-PrediXcan we identified 74 SCZ risk genes, 34% of which were novel, and 67% of these risk genes were replicated in a MR-Egger test. Notably, the majority (52) of these risk genes were identified using eQTL data and 70% of these SCZ-risk-gene-driving eQTLs show little to no evidence of driving corresponding variations at the protein level.The effect of eQTLs on gene expression in the prefrontal cortex is commonly attenuated post-transcriptionally. Many of the attenuated eQTLs still correlate with SCZ GWAS signal. Further investigation is needed to elucidate a mechanistic link between attenuated eQTLs and SCZ disease risk."

We hypothesized that methods that leverage shared regulatory effects across different conditions, in this case, across different populations, may improve cross-population transcriptome prediction. To test this hypothesis, we made transcriptome prediction models for use in transcriptome-wide association studies (TWASs) using different methods (elastic net, joint-tissue imputation [JTI], matrix expression quantitative trait loci [Matrix eQTL], multivariate adaptive shrinkage in R [MASHR], and transcriptome-integrated genetic association resource [TIGAR]) and tested their out-of-sample transcriptome prediction accuracy in population-matched and cross-population scenarios. Additionally, to evaluate model applicability in TWASs, we integrated publicly available multiethnic genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics from the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) study and Pan-ancestry genetic analysis of the UK Biobank (PanUKBB) with our developed transcriptome prediction models. In regard to transcriptome prediction accuracy, MASHR models performed better or the same as other methods in both population-matched and cross-population transcriptome predictions. Furthermore, in multiethnic TWASs, MASHR models yielded more discoveries that replicate in both PAGE and PanUKBB across all methods analyzed, including loci previously mapped in GWASs and loci previously not found in GWASs. Overall, our study demonstrates the importance of using methods that benefit from different populations' effect size estimates in order to improve TWASs for multiethnic or underrepresented populations.© 2023 The Author(s)."

The mortality of heifers poses a significant challenge to the management and profitability of the dairy industry. In dairy farming, achieving early first calving of heifers is also essential for optimal productivity and sustainability. Recently, Council on Dairy Cattle Breeding (CDCB) and USDA have developed new evaluations of heifer health and fertility traits. However, the genetic basis of these traits has yet to be thoroughly studied.Leveraging the extensive U.S dairy genomic database maintained at CDCB, we conducted large-scale GWAS analyses of two heifer traits, livability and early first calving. Despite the large sample size, we found no major QTL for heifer livability. However, we identified a major QTL in the bovine MHC region associated with early first calving. Our GO analysis based on nearby genes detected 91 significant GO terms with a large proportion related to the immune system. This QTL in the MHC region was also confirmed in the analysis of 27 K bull with imputed sequence variants. Since these traits have few major QTL, we evaluated the genome-wide distribution of GWAS signals across different functional genomics categories. For heifer livability, we observed significant enrichment in promotor and enhancer-related regions. For early calving, we found more associations in active TSS, active Elements, and Insulator. We also identified significant enrichment of CDS and conserved variants in the GWAS results of both traits. By linking GWAS results and transcriptome data from the CattleGTEx project via TWAS, we detected four and 23 significant gene-trait association pairs for heifer livability and early calving, respectively. Interestingly, we discovered six genes for early calving in the Bovine MHC region, including two genes in lymph node tissue and one gene each in blood, adipose, hypothalamus, and leukocyte.Our large-scale GWAS analyses of two heifer traits identified a major QTL in the bovine MHC region for early first calving. Additional functional enrichment and TWAS analyses confirmed the MHC QTL with relevant biological evidence. Our results revealed the complex genetic basis of heifer health and fertility traits and indicated a potential connection between the immune system and reproduction in cattle.© 2023.

Epistasis has been proposed as a major contributor to this 'missing heritability', however, many current methods are limited to only modelling additive effects. We use VariantSpark, a machine learning approach to GWAS, and BitEpi, a tool for epistasis detection, to identify AD associated variants and interactions across two independent cohorts, ADNI and UK Biobank. By incorporating significant epistatic interactions, we captured 10.41% more phenotypic variance than logistic regression (LR). We validate the well-established AD loci, APOE, and identify two novel genome-wide significant AD associated loci in both cohorts, SH3BP4 and SASH1, which are also in significant epistatic interactions with APOE. We show that the SH3BP4 SNP has a modulating effect on the known pathogenic APOE SNP, demonstrating a possible protective mechanism against AD. SASH1 is involved in a triplet interaction with pathogenic APOE SNP and ACOT11, where the SASH1 SNP lowered the pathogenic interaction effect between ACOT11 and APOE. Finally, we demonstrate that VariantSpark detects disease associations with 80% fewer controls than LR, unlocking discoveries in well annotated but smaller cohorts.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."

We characterize 1,258 genes comprising 36 genetic modules that control staged fiber development and uncover genetic components governing their partitioned expression relative to subgenomic duplicated genes (homoeologs). Only about 30% of fiber quality-related homoeologs show phenotypically favorable allele aggregation in cultivars, highlighting the potential for subgenome additivity in fiber improvement. We envision a genome-enabled breeding strategy, with particular attention to 48 favorable alleles related to fiber phenotypes that have been subjected to purifying selection during domestication.

Most of the GWAS-identified SNPs are in non-coding regions. Connecting these non-coding variants and downstream affected genes is a challenge and, up to date, only a few functional mutations or expression quantitative loci (cis-eQTLs) associated with PTB susceptibility have been identified. In the current study, the associations between imputed whole-genome sequence genotypes and whole RNA-Sequencing data from peripheral blood (PB) and ileocecal valve (ICV) samples of Spanish Holstein cows (N = 16) were analyzed with TensorQTL. This approach allowed the identification of 88 and 37 cis-eQTLs regulating the expression levels of 90 and 37 genes in PB and ICV samples, respectively (False discorey rate, FDR ≤ 0.05). Next, we applied summary-based data Mendelian randomization (SMR) to integrate the cis-eQTL dataset with GWAS data obtained from a cohort of 813 culled cattle that were classified according to the presence or absence of PTB-associated histopathological lesions in gut tissues. After multiple testing corrections (FDR ≤ 0.05), we identified two novel cis-eQTLs affecting the expression of the early growth response factor 4 (EGR4) and the bovine neuroblastoma breakpoint family member 6-like protein isoform 2 (MGC134040) that showed pleiotropic associations with the presence of multifocal and diffuse lesions in gut tissues; P = 0.002 and P = 0.017, respectively. While EGR4 acts as a brake on T-cell proliferation and cytokine production through interaction with the nuclear factor Kappa β (NF-κß), MGC134040 is a target gene of NF-κß. Our findings provide a better understanding of the genetic factors influencing PTB outcomes, confirm that the multifocal lesions are localized/confined lesions that have different underlying host genetics than the diffuse lesions, and highlight regulatory SNPs and regulated-gene targets to design future functional studies.© 2023.

"398",37808547,"Causal Inference in Transcriptome-Wide Association Studies with Invalid Instruments and GWAS Summary Data.","J Am Stat Assoc","Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have recently emerged as a popular tool to discover (putative) causal genes by integrating an outcome GWAS dataset with another gene expression/transcriptome GWAS (called eQTL) dataset. In our motivating and target application, we'd like to identify causal genes for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), which is crucial for developing new treatments for hyperlipidemia and cardiovascular diseases. The statistical principle underlying TWAS is (two-sample) two-stage least squares (2SLS) using multiple correlated SNPs as instrumental variables (IVs); it is closely related to typical (two-sample) Mendelian randomization (MR) using independent SNPs as IVs, which is expected to be impractical and lower-powered for TWAS (and some other) applications. However, often some of the SNPs used may not be valid IVs, e.g. due to the widespread pleiotropy of their direct effects on the outcome not mediated through the gene of interest, leading to false conclusions by TWAS (or MR). Building on recent advances in sparse regression, we propose a robust and efficient inferential method to account for both hidden confounding and some invalid IVs via two-stage constrained maximum likelihood (2ScML), an extension of 2SLS. We first develop the proposed method with individual-level data, then extend it both theoretically and computationally to GWAS summary data for the most popular two-sample TWAS design, to which almost all existing robust IV regression methods are however not applicable. We show that the proposed method achieves asymptotically valid statistical inference on causal effects, demonstrating its wider applicability and superior finite-sample performance over the standard 2SLS/TWAS (and MR). We apply the methods to identify putative causal genes for LDL by integrating large-scale lipid GWAS summary data with eQTL data."

We then explored the genetic relationship using summary statistics from the largest genome-wide association study of four lipids (N = 1,320,016), CKD (Ncase = 41,395, Ncontrol = 439,303), and eGFR(N = 567,460).There were significant phenotypic associations (HDL-C: hazard ratio (HR) = 0.76, 95%CI = 0.60-0.95; TG: HR = 1.08, 95%CI = 1.02-1.13) and global genetic correlations (HDL-C: [Formula: see text] = - 0.132, P = 1.00 × 10-4; TG: [Formula: see text] = 0.176; P = 2.66 × 10-5) between HDL-C, TG, and CKD risk. Partitioning the whole genome into 2353 LD-independent regions, twelve significant regions were observed for four lipids and CKD. The shared genetic basis was largely explained by 29 pleiotropic loci and 36 shared gene-tissue pairs. Mendelian randomization revealed an independent causal relationship of genetically predicted HDL-C (odds ratio = 0.91, 95%CI = 0.85-0.98), but not for LDL-C, TC, or TG, with the risk of CKD. Regarding eGFR, a similar pattern of correlation and pleiotropy was observed.Our work demonstrates a putative causal role of HDL-C in CKD and a significant biological pleiotropy underlying lipids and CKD in populations of European ancestry.

The FUSION software was used for both single-tissue and cross-tissue TWAS, which were combined using an aggregate Cauchy association test. The biological function and pathways of the TWAS genes were explored using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) databases, and the human cartilage mRNA expression profiles were utilized to validate the TWAS genes. CGSEA analysis was performed to scan the OA-associated chemicals by integrating the TWAS results with the chemical-related gene sets.There were 44 and 93 unique TWAS genes identified in 7 and 11 chromosomes for KOA and HOA, respectively, fourteen and four of which showed significantly differential expression in the mRNA profiles, such as CRHR1, LTBP1, WWP2, LMX1B, and PTHLH.

Here, we develop a statistical method called multi-trait assisted PGS (mtPGS), which can construct accurate PGSs for a target trait of interest by leveraging multiple traits relevant to the target trait. Specifically, mtPGS borrows SNP effect size similarity information between the target trait and its relevant traits to improve the effect size estimation on the target trait, thus achieving accurate PGSs. In the process, mtPGS flexibly models the shared genetic architecture between the target and the relevant traits to achieve robust performance, while explicitly accounting for the environmental covariance among them to accommodate different study designs with various sample overlap patterns. In addition, mtPGS uses only summary statistics as input and relies on a deterministic algorithm with several algebraic techniques for scalable computation. We evaluate the performance of mtPGS through comprehensive simulations and applications to 25 traits in the UK Biobank, where in the real data mtPGS achieves an average of 0.90%-52.91% accuracy gain compared to the state-of-the-art PGS methods.

We then investigated the genetic relationship leveraging the largest genome-wide genetic summary statistics. We finally examined the phenotypic association using the comprehensive data from UK Biobank (UKB).An overall significant effect of GSD on CVD was found in meta-analysis (relative risk [RR] = 1.26, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.19-1.34).

Results from TWAS analyses are often interpreted as indicating a genetic relationship between gene expression and a phenotype, but this interpretation is not consistent with the null hypothesis that is evaluated in the traditional TWAS framework. In this study we provide a mathematical outline of this TWAS framework, and elucidate what interpretations are warranted given the null hypothesis it actually tests. We then use both simulations and real data analysis to assess the implications of misinterpreting TWAS results as indicative of a genetic relationship between gene expression and the phenotype. Our simulation results show considerably inflated type 1 error rates for TWAS when interpreted this way, with 41% of significant TWAS associations detected in the real data analysis found to have insufficient statistical evidence to infer such a relationship. This demonstrates that in current implementations, TWAS cannot reliably be used to investigate genetic relationships between gene expression and a phenotype, but that local genetic correlation analysis can serve as a potential alternative.Copyright: © 2023 de Leeuw et al.

To better understand the biological processes underlying lipid metabolism, we investigated the associations of plasma protein levels with total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) in blood. We trained protein prediction models based on samples in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) and applied them to conduct proteome-wide association studies (PWAS) for lipids using the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium (GLGC) data. Of the 749 proteins tested, 42 were significantly associated with at least one lipid trait. Furthermore, we performed transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) for lipids using 9,714 gene expression prediction models trained on samples from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in MESA and 49 tissues in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. We found that although PWAS and TWAS can show different directions of associations in an individual gene, 40 out of 49 tissues showed a positive correlation between PWAS and TWAS signed p-values across all the genes, which suggests a high-level consistency between proteome-lipid associations and transcriptome-lipid associations."

We identify 158 novel genetic associations, more than doubling the number of known associations with TSH, and implicate 112 putative causal genes, of which 76 are not previously implicated. A polygenic score for TSH is associated with TSH levels in African, South Asian, East Asian, Middle Eastern and admixed American ancestries, and associated with hypothyroidism and other thyroid disease in South Asians. In Europeans, the TSH polygenic score is associated with thyroid disease, including thyroid cancer and age-of-onset of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. We develop pathway-specific genetic risk scores for TSH levels and use these in phenome-wide association studies to identify potential consequences of pathway perturbation. Together, these findings demonstrate the potential utility of genetic associations to inform future therapeutics and risk prediction for thyroid diseases.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."

To address this, we developed a deep learning-based approach to learn the genomic conservation at the functional level (DeepGCF) between species by integrating 386 and 374 functional profiles from humans and pigs, respectively. DeepGCF demonstrated better prediction performance compared with the previous method. In addition, the resulting DeepGCF score captures the functional conservation between humans and pigs by examining chromatin states, sequence ontologies, and regulatory variants. We identified a core set of genomic regions as functionally conserved that plays key roles in gene regulation and is enriched for the heritability of complex traits and diseases in humans.

To investigate this, we constructed an atlas of over 180,000 consensus RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)-bound intergenic regions from 900 RNAPII chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments in normal and cancer samples. Through unsupervised analysis, we identified 51 RNAPII consensus clusters, many of which mapped to specific biotypes and revealed tissue-specific regulatory signatures. We developed a meta-clustering methodology to integrate our RNAPII atlas with active transcription across 28,797 RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), and Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE). This analysis revealed strong tissue- and disease-specific interconnections between RNAPII occupancy and transcriptional activity. We demonstrate that intergenic transcription at RNAPII-bound regions is a novel per-cancer and pan-cancer biomarker. This biomarker displays genomic and clinically relevant characteristics, distinguishing cancer subtypes and linking to overall survival. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of coherent data integration to uncover intergenic transcriptional activity in normal and cancer tissues.© 2023 The Authors."

However, a comprehensive understanding of the gene-regulatory profile of peripheral autoimmunity and the diverse immune responses across distinct cell types in Behcet's disease (BD) is still lacking. Here, we present a multi-omic single-cell study of 424,817 cells in BD patients and non-BD individuals. This study maps chromatin accessibility and gene expression in the same biological samples, unraveling vast cellular heterogeneity. We identify widespread cell-type-specific, disease-associated active and pro-inflammatory immunity in both transcript and epigenomic aspects. Notably, integrative multi-omic analysis reveals putative TF regulators that might contribute to chromatin accessibility and gene expression in BD. Moreover, we predicted gene-regulatory networks within nominated TF activators, including AP-1, NF-kB, and ETS transcript factor families, which may regulate cellular interaction and govern inflammation. Our study illustrates the epigenetic and transcriptional landscape in BD peripheral blood and expands understanding of potential epigenomic immunopathology in this disease.© 2023.

We generated an atlas of single-nucleus gene expression and chromatin accessibility in the amygdala of outbred rats with high and low cocaine addiction-like behaviors following prolonged abstinence. Differentially expressed genes between the high and low groups were enriched for energy metabolism across cell types. Rats with high addiction index (AI) showed increased relapse-like behaviors and GABAergic transmission in the amygdala. Both phenotypes were reversed by pharmacological inhibition of the glyoxalase 1 enzyme, which metabolizes methylglyoxal-a GABAAreceptor agonist produced by glycolysis. Differences in chromatin accessibility between high and low AI rats implicated pioneer transcription factors in the basic helix-loop-helix, FOX, SOX and activator protein 1 families. We observed opposite regulation of chromatin accessibility across many cell types. Most notably, excitatory neurons had greater accessibility in high AI rats and inhibitory neurons had greater accessibility in low AI rats.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Variants within these loci are found predominantly in noncoding regions of DNA making their mechanisms of conferring risk hard to define. Epigenomic studies have shown noncoding variants broadly impact regulatory element activity. The possible association of noncoding PSC variants with regulatory element activity has not been studied. We aimed to (1) determine if the noncoding risk variants in PSC impact regulatory element function and (2) if so, assess the role these regulatory elements have in explaining the genetic risk for PSC.Available epigenomic datasets were integrated to build a comprehensive atlas of cell type-specific regulatory elements, emphasizing PSC-relevant cell types. RNA-seq and ATAC-seq were performed on peripheral CD4+ T cells from 10 PSC patients and 11 healthy controls. Computational techniques were used to (1) study the enrichment of PSC-risk variants within regulatory elements, (2) correlate risk genotype with differences in regulatory element activity, and (3) identify regulatory elements differentially active and genes differentially expressed between PSC patients and controls.Noncoding PSC-risk variants are strongly enriched within immune-specific enhancers, particularly ones involved in T-cell response to antigenic stimulation. In total, 250 genes and >10,000 regulatory elements were identified that are differentially active between patients and controls.Mechanistic effects are proposed for variants at 6 PSC-risk loci where genotype was linked with differential T-cell regulatory element activity. Regulatory elements are shown to play a key role in PSC pathophysiology.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

We developed a likelihood-free approach, called CoalNN, which uses a convolutional neural network to predict pairwise TMRCAs and allele ages from sequencing or SNP array data. CoalNN is trained through simulation and can be adapted to varying parameters, such as demographic history, using transfer learning. Across several simulated scenarios, CoalNN matched or outperformed the accuracy of model-based approaches for pairwise TMRCA and allele age prediction. We applied CoalNN to settings for which model-based approaches are under-developed and performed analyses to gain insights into the set of features it uses to perform TMRCA prediction. We next used CoalNN to analyze 2,504 samples from 26 populations in the 1,000 Genome Project data set, inferring the age of ∼80 million variants. We observed substantial variation across populations and for variants predicted to be pathogenic, reflecting heterogeneous demographic histories and the action of negative selection. We used CoalNN's predicted allele ages to construct genome-wide annotations capturing the signature of past negative selection. We performed LD-score regression analysis of heritability using summary association statistics from 63 independent complex traits and diseases (average N=314k), observing increased annotation-specific effects on heritability compared to a previous allele age annotation. These results highlight the effectiveness of using likelihood-free, simulation-trained models to infer properties of gene genealogies in large genomic data sets.© The Author(s) 2023.

We further establish the link between functional variants and target genes by single-cell CRISPRi screening in microglia. In addition, we show that AD variants exhibit allelic imbalance on target gene expression. In particular, rs7922621 is the effective variant in controlling TSPAN14 expression among other nominated variants in the same cCRE and exerts multiple physiological effects including reduced cell surface ADAM10 and altered soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) shedding.

Motivated by evidence for a strong genetic component, our prior genome-wide association study (GWAS) efforts for childhood obesity revealed 19 independent signals for the trait; however, the mechanism of action of these loci remains to be elucidated.To molecularly characterize these childhood obesity loci we sought to determine the underlying causal variants and the corresponding effector genes within diverse cellular contexts.Integrate childhood obesity GWAS summary statistics with our existing 3D genomic datasets for 57 human cell types, consisting of high-resolution promoter-focused Capture-C/Hi-C, ATAC-seq, and RNA-seq, in order to apply stratified LD score regression and calculate the proportion of genome-wide SNP heritability attributable to cell type-specific features. Subsequent chromatin contact-based fine-mapping was carried out for genome-wide significant childhood obesity loci and their linkage disequilibrium proxies to implicate effector genes.Pancreatic alpha cells revealed the most statistically significant enrichment of childhood obesity variants. Subsequent chromatin contact-based fine-mapping yielded the most abundant number of candidate variants and target genes at theBDNF,ADCY3, TMEM18andFTOloci in skeletal muscle myotubes and the pancreatic beta-cell line, EndoC-BH1. One novel implicated effector gene,ALKAL2- an inflammation-responsive gene in nerve nociceptors - was observed at the keyTMEM18locus across multiple immune cell types.

However, little is known about the function of Lipin3 in triglyceride (TG) metabolism. Here, we identified a novel mutation (NM_001301860: p.1835A>T/p.D612V) of Lipin3 in a large family with hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) and obesity through whole-exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing. Functional studies revealed that the novel variant altered the half-life and stability of the Lipin3 protein. Hence, we generated Lipin3 heterozygous knockout (Lipin3-heKO) mice and cultured primary hepatocytes to explore the pathophysiological roles of Lipin3 in TG metabolism. We found that Lipin3-heKO mice exhibited obvious obesity, HTG, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disorder. Mechanistic study demonstrated that the haploinsufficiency of Lipin3 in primary hepatocytes may induce the overexpression and abnormal distribution of Lipin1 in cytosol and nucleoplasm. The increased expression of Lipin1 in cytosol may contribute to TG anabolism, and the decreased Lipin1 in nucleoplasm can reduce PGC1α, further leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced TG catabolism.

BMI-GRS with 30 well-known SNPs was computed and the interaction of individual SNPs with food items and their summary dietary scores were examined in relation to age- and sex-specific BMI z-score (BMIz). The whole BMI-GRS interacted with several foods on BMIz. We identified 7-11 SNPs responsible for each interaction and these were combined into food-specific GRS. The most predominant interaction was witnessed for pizza (p < 0.001): the effect on BMIz was b - 0.130 (95% CI - 0.23; - 0.031) in those with low-risk, and 0.153 (95% CI 0.072; 0.234) in high-risk. Corresponding, but weaker interactions were verified for sweets and chocolate, sugary juice drink, and hamburger and hotdog. In total 5 SNPs close to genes NEGR1, SEC16B, TMEM18, GNPDA2, and FTO were shared between these interactions. Our results suggested that children genetically prone to obesity showed a stronger association of unhealthy foods with BMIz than those with lower genetic susceptibility.

We implicated rs7132908 as a putative causal variant at this locus leveraging a combination of our inhouse 3D genomic data, public domain datasets, and several computational approaches. Using a luciferase reporter assay in human primary astrocytes, we observed allele-specificcis-regulatory activity of the immediate region harboring rs7132908. Motivated by this finding, we went on to generate isogenic human embryonic stem cell lines homozygous for either rs7132908 allele with CRISPR-Cas9 homology-directed repair to assess changes in gene expression due to genotype and chromatin accessibility throughout a differentiation to hypothalamic neurons, a key cell type known to regulate feeding behavior. We observed that the rs7132908 obesity risk allele influenced the expression ofFAIM2along with other genes, decreased the proportion of neurons produced during differentiation, up-regulated cell death gene sets, and conversely down-regulated neuron differentiation gene sets.

The participants were randomly allocated into two groups: the resistance training group (control group) and the combined training group (experimental group), which involved both resistance training and aerobic training. Aerobic training consisted of 30 min aerobic interval training sessions three times a week with a total of 8 min work bouts in each at 60-70% of heart rate reserve (HRR).

However, several major challenges still remain for existing fine-mapping methods. First, the strong linkage disequilibrium among variants can limit the statistical power and resolution of fine-mapping. Second, it is computationally expensive to simultaneously search for multiple causal variants. Third, the confounding bias hidden in GWAS summary statistics can produce spurious signals. To address these challenges, we develop a statistical method for cross-population fine-mapping (XMAP) by leveraging genetic diversity and accounting for confounding bias. By using cross-population GWAS summary statistics from global biobanks and genomic consortia, we show that XMAP can achieve greater statistical power, better control of false positive rate, and substantially higher computational efficiency for identifying multiple causal signals, compared to existing methods. Importantly, we show that the output of XMAP can be integrated with single-cell datasets, which greatly improves the interpretation of putative causal variants in their cellular context at single-cell resolution.© 2023.

Our aim was to apply a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to assess the causal impact of lipid-lowering agents and circulating lipid traits on ALS risk.Our study included primary and secondary analyses, in which the risk associations of lipid-lowering gene inhibitors, lipid traits, and ALS were assessed by the inverse variance weighting method as the primary approach. The robustness of the results was assessed using LDSC assessment, conventional MR sensitivity analysis, and used Mediating MR to explore potential mechanisms of occurrence. In the secondary analysis, the association of lipid-lowering genes with ALS was validated using the Summary data-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) method.Our results showed strong evidence between genetic proxies for Apolipoprotein B (ApoB) inhibitor (OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.68 - 0.86; P = 5.58 × 10-6) and reduced risk of ALS. Additionally, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) inhibitor (OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 0. 85-1.33) was not found to increase ALS risk. SMR results suggested that ApoB expression was associated with increased ALS risk, and colocalization analysis did not support a significant common genetic variation between ApoB and ALS. Mediator MR analysis suggested a possible mediating role for interleukin-6 and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). While elevated LDL-C was significantly associated with increased risk of ALS among lipid traits, total cholesterol (TC) and ApoB were weakly associated with ALS. LDSC results suggested a potential genetic correlation between these lipid traits and ALS.Using ApoB inhibitor can lower the risk of ALS, statins do not trigger ALS, and LDL-C, TC, and ApoB levels can predict the risk of ALS.© 2023.

We specified multiple regression models using genomic structural equation modeling to detect residual genetic variance in childhood maltreatment after accounting for genetically correlated traits.In 2 separate models, the shared genetic component of 12 health and behavioral traits and 7 psychiatric disorders accounted for 59% and 56% of heritability due to common genetic variants (single nucleotide polymorphism-based heritability [h2SNP]) of childhood maltreatment, respectively. Genetic influences on h2SNPof childhood maltreatment were generally accounted for by a shared genetic component across traits. The exceptions to this were general risk tolerance, subjective well-being, posttraumatic stress disorder, and autism spectrum disorder, identified as independent contributors to h2SNPof childhood maltreatment. These 4 traits alone were sufficient to explain 58% of h2SNPof childhood maltreatment.We identified putative traits that reflect h2SNPof childhood maltreatment. Elucidating the mechanisms underlying these associations may improve trauma prevention and posttraumatic intervention strategies.© 2023 The Authors."

This study aimed to conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of TBI in VA Million Veteran Program (MVP) enrollees. Participants included a multi-ancestry cohort (European, African, and Hispanic ancestries; N = 304,485; 111,494 TBI cases, 192,991 controls). TBI was assessed using MVP survey data and International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes from the Veterans Health Administration's electronic health record. GWAS was performed using logistic regression in PLINK, and meta-analyzed in METAL. FUMA was used for post-GWAS analysis. Genomic structural equation modeling (gSEM) was conducted to investigate underlying genetic associations with TBI, and bivariate MiXeR was used to estimate phenotype specific and shared polygenicity. SNP-based heritability was 0.060 (SE = 0.004, p = 7.83×10-66). GWAS analysis identified 15 genome-wide significant (GWS) loci at p < 5×10-8. Gene-based analyses revealed 14 gene-wide significant genes; top genes included NCAM1, APOE, FTO, and FOXP2. Gene tissue expression analysis identified the brain as significantly enriched, particularly in the frontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and nucleus accumbens. Genetic correlations with TBI were significant for risk-taking behaviors and psychiatric disorders, but generally not significant for the neurocognitive variables investigated. gSEM analysis revealed stronger associations with risk-taking traits than with psychiatric traits. Finally, the genetic architecture of TBI was similar to polygenic psychiatric disorders. Neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease showed much less polygenicity, however, the proportion of shared variance with TBI was high. This first well-powered GWAS of TBI identified 15 loci including genes relevant to TBI biology, and showed that TBI is a heritable trait with comparable genetic architecture and high genetic correlation with psychiatric traits. Our findings set the stage for future TBI GWASs that focus on injury severity and diversity and chronicity of symptom sequelae.© 2023.

PUFA nutritional deficiency and imbalance have been linked to a variety of chronic brain disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety, and anorexia. However, the effects of PUFAs on brain disorders remain inconclusive, and the extent of their shared genetic determinants is largely unknown. Here, we used genome-wide association summary statistics to systematically examine the shared genetic basis between six phenotypes of circulating PUFAs (N = 114,999) and 20 brain disorders (N = 9,725-762,917), infer their potential causal relationships, identify colocalized regions, and pinpoint shared genetic variants. Genetic correlation and polygenic overlap analyses revealed a widespread shared genetic basis for 77 trait pairs between six PUFA phenotypes and 16 brain disorders. Two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis indicated potential causal relationships for 16 pairs of PUFAs and brain disorders, including alcohol consumption, bipolar disorder (BIP), and MDD. Colocalization analysis identified 40 shared loci (13 unique) among six PUFAs and ten brain disorders. Twenty-two unique variants were statistically inferred as candidate shared causal variants, including rs1260326 (GCKR), rs174564 (FADS2) and rs4818766 (ADARB1). These findings reveal a widespread shared genetic basis between PUFAs and brain disorders, pinpoint specific shared variants, and provide support for the potential effects of PUFAs on certain brain disorders, especially MDD, BIP, and alcohol consumption."

There have been no large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of RTV and little is known about its genetic underpinnings. Here, we used data from the UK Biobank to conduct a GWAS of RTV in participants of white British ancestry (n = 404,302) as well as a trans-ancestry GWAS meta-analysis (n = 44,873) to assess replication. We found 161 genome-wide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) distributed across 7 genomic loci in our discovery GWAS. Functional annotation of the variants implicated genes involved in synaptic function and neural development. The SNP-based heritability (h2SNP) estimate for RTV was 3%. We investigated genetic correlations between RTV and selected neuropsychological traits using linkage disequilibrium score regression, and found significant correlations with several traits, including a positive correlation with mean reaction time and schizophrenia. Despite the high genetic correlation between RTV and mean reaction time, we demonstrate distinctions in the genetic underpinnings of these traits. Lastly, we assessed the predictive ability of a polygenic score (PGS) for RTV, calculated using PRSice and PRS-CS, and found that the RTV-PGS significantly predicted RTV in independent cohorts, but that the generalisability to other ancestry groups was poor. These results identify genetic underpinnings of RTV, and support the use of RTV as an endophenotype for neurological and psychiatric disorders.© 2023. The Author(s)."

While numerous genome-wide association studies have been reported for specific pain-related traits, many of these studies were underpowered, and the genetic relationship among these traits remains poorly understood. Here, we conducted a joint analysis of genome-wide association study summary statistics from seventeen pain susceptibility traits in the UK Biobank. This analysis revealed 99 genome-wide significant risk loci, 65 of which overlap loci identified in earlier studies. The remaining 34 loci are novel. We applied leave-one-trait-out meta-analyses to evaluate the influence of each trait on the joint analysis, which suggested that loci fall into four categories: loci associated with nearly all pain-related traits; loci primarily associated with a single trait; loci associated with multiple forms of skeletomuscular pain; and loci associated with headache-related pain. Overall, 664 genes were mapped to the 99 loci by genomic proximity, eQTLs, and chromatin interaction and ~15% of these genes showed differential expression in individuals with acute or chronic pain compared to healthy controls. Risk loci were enriched for genes involved in neurological and inflammatory pathways. Genetic correlation and two-sample Mendelian randomization indicated that psychiatric, metabolic, and immunological traits mediate some of these effects.Copyright: © 2023 Mocci et al.

However, their shared genetic components have not been systematically studied. Here, we composed an atlas of the shared genetic associations between 11 immune-mediated diseases and AD by analyzing genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics. Our results unveiled a significant genetic overlap between AD and 11 individual immune-mediated diseases despite negligible genetic correlations, suggesting a complex shared genetic architecture distributed across the genome. The shared loci between AD and immune-mediated diseases implicated several genes, includingGRAMD1B, FUT2, ADAMTS4, HBEGF, WNT3, TSPAN14, DHODH, ABCB9andTNIP1, all of which are protein-coding genes and thus potential drug targets. Top biological pathways enriched with these identified shared genes were related to the immune system and cell adhesion. In addition,in silicosingle-cell analyses showed enrichment of immune and brain cells, including neurons and microglia. In summary, our results suggest a genetic relationship between AD and the 11 immune-mediated diseases, pinpointing the existence of a shared however non-causal genetic basis. These identified protein-coding genes have the potential to serve as a novel path to therapeutic interventions for both AD and immune-mediated diseases and their comorbidities."

In this study, we aimed to investigate the causal relationship between sleep duration, insomnia, and common oral diseases.We utilized genetic correlation and two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses based on summary statistics from genome-wide association studies of sleep duration (N = 460,099), insomnia (N = 462,341), mouth ulcer (N = 385,026), oral cavity cancer (N = 4,151), and periodontal disease (N = 527,652).Our results revealed a negative genetic correlation between sleep duration and mouth ulcer (genetic correlation: -0.09, P = 0.007), while a positive genetic correlation between insomnia and mouth ulcer was observed (genetic correlation: 0.18, P = 2.51E-06). Furthermore, we demonstrated that longer sleep duration is significantly associated with a reduced risk of mouth ulcers (OR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.54-0.83, P = 2.84E-04), whereas insomnia is nominally associated with an increased risk of mouth ulcers (OR: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.01-1.95, P = 0.044). In contrast, no significant association was detected between sleep quality and periodontal disease or oral cavity cancer.This work provides robust evidence to support the notion that enhanced sleep quality may confer a decreased risk of oral ulcers, thereby bearing considerable clinical relevance.© 2023.

We conducted a genome-wide association study including 5,147 RP cases and 439,294 controls, based on diagnoses from electronic health records, and identified three unreported genomic regions associated with the risk of RP (p < 5 × 10-8). We prioritized ADRA2A (rs7090046, odds ratio (OR) per allele: 1.26; 95%-CI: 1.20-1.31; p < 9.6 × 10-27) and IRX1 (rs12653958, OR: 1.17; 95%-CI: 1.12-1.22, p < 4.8 × 10-13) as candidate causal genes through integration of gene expression in disease relevant tissues. We further identified a likely causal detrimental effect of low fasting glucose levels on RP risk (rG = -0.21; p-value = 2.3 × 10-3), and systematically highlighted drug repurposing opportunities, like the antidepressant mirtazapine. Our results provide the first robust evidence for a strong genetic contribution to RP and highlight a so far underrated role of α2A-adrenoreceptor signalling, encoded at ADRA2A, as a possible mechanism for hypersensitivity to catecholamine-induced vasospasms.© 2023.

We identified 188 cell types and characterized their molecular signatures. Integrative analyses revealed concordant changes in DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility, chromatin organization, and gene expression across cell types, cortical areas, and basal ganglia structures.

We simultaneously profiled gene expression and chromatin accessibility in 45,549 cortical nuclei across six broad developmental time points from fetus to adult. We identified cell type-specific domains in which chromatin accessibility is highly correlated with gene expression. Differentiation pseudotime trajectory analysis indicates that chromatin accessibility at CREs precedes transcription and that dynamic changes in chromatin structure play a critical role in neuronal lineage commitment. In addition, we mapped cell type-specific and temporally specific genetic loci implicated in neuropsychiatric traits, including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Together, our results describe the complex regulation of cell composition at critical stages in lineage determination and shed light on the impact of spatiotemporal alterations in gene expression on neuropsychiatric disease."

And several sensitivity tests were carried out to validate the MR findings.The IVW outcomes suggested that three bacterial traits exhibited associations with susceptibility to respiratory TB after Bonferroni correction, namely Lachnospiraceae UCG010 (odds ratio [OR] 1.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17-2.55, P = 0.005), Eubacterium (brachy group) (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.07-1.65, P = 0.009), and Ruminococcaceae UCG005 (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.52-0.98, P = 0.034). Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that horizontal pleiotropy and heterogeneity were absent, thereby guaranteeing the reliability of the results.This research sheds light on the causal impact of gut microbiota on respiratory tuberculosis susceptibility, improving our knowledge of therapeutic strategies for managing TB.© 2023.

Alterations in inflammatory mediators and infection are associated with alterations in HDL cholesterol. It is unknown whether the association between HDL and infection is present for all particle sizes, and whether the observed associations are confounded by IL-6 signalling.In the UK Biobank, ~ 270,000 individuals have data on HDL subclasses derived from nuclear magnetic resonance analysis. We estimated the association of particle count of total HDL and HDL subclasses (small, medium, large, and extra-large HDL) with sepsis, sepsis-related death, and critical care admission in a Cox regression model. We subsequently utilised genetic data from UK Biobank and FinnGen to perform Mendelian randomisation (MR) of each HDL subclass and sepsis to test for a causal relationship. Finally, we explored the role of IL-6 signalling as a potential causal driver of changes in HDL subclasses.In observational analyses, higher particle count of small HDL was associated with protection from sepsis (Hazard ratio, HR 0.80; 95% CI 0.74-0.86, p = 4 × 10-9comparing Quartile 4, highest quartile of HDL to Quartile 1, lowest quartile of HDL), sepsis-related death (HR 0.80; 95% CI 0.74-0.86, p = 2 × 10-4), and critical care admission with sepsis (HR 0.72 95% CI 0.60-0.85, p = 2 × 10-4). Parallel associations with other HDL subclasses were likely driven by changes in the small HDL compartment. MR analyses did not strongly support causality of small HDL particle count on sepsis incidence (Odds ratio, OR 0.98; 95% CI 0.89-1.07, p = 0.6) or death (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.75-1.17, p = 0.56), although the estimate on critical care admission with sepsis supported protection (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.57-0.95, p = 0.02). Bidirectional MR analyses suggested that increased IL-6 signalling was associated with reductions in both small (beta on small HDL particle count - 0.16, 95% CI - 0.10 to - 0.21 per natural log change in SD-scaled CRP, p = 9 × 10-8).and total HDL particle count (beta - 0.13, 95% CI - 0.09 to - 0.17, p = 7 × 10-10), but that the reverse effect of HDL on IL-6 signalling was largely null.Low number of small HDL particles are associated with increased hazard of sepsis, sepsis-related death, and sepsis-related critical care admission. However, genetic analyses did not strongly support this as causal. Instead, we demonstrate that increased IL-6 signalling, which is known to alter infection risk, could confound associations with reduced HDL particle count, and suggest this may explain part of the observed association between (small) HDL particle count and sepsis.© 2023.

We performed bidirectional MR analyses to explore the causal relationships between the GM and stroke, and two mediation analyses, two-step MR and multivariable MR, to discover potential mediating metabolites.Ten taxa were causally associated with stroke, and stroke led to changes in 27 taxa. In the two-step MR, Bifidobacteriales order, Bifidobacteriaceae family, Desulfovibrio genus, apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1), phospholipids in high-density lipoprotein (HDL_PL), and the ratio of apolipoprotein B to ApoA1 (ApoB/ApoA1) were causally associated with stroke (all P<0.044). The causal associations between Bifidobacteriales order, Bifidobacteriaceae family and stroke were validated using the weighted median method in an independent cohort. The three GM taxa were all positively associated with ApoA1 and HDL_PL, whereas Desulfovibrio genus was negatively associated with ApoB/ApoA1 (all P<0.010). Additionally, the causal associations between the three GM taxa and ApoA1 remained significant after correcting for the false discovery rate (all q-values <0.027). Multivariable MR showed that the associations between Bifidobacteriales order, Bifidobacteriaceae family and stroke were mediated by ApoA1 and HDL_PL, each accounting for 6.5% (P=0.028) and 4.6% (P=0.033); the association between Desulfovibrio genus and stroke was mediated by ApoA1, HDL_PL, and ApoB/ApoA1, with mediated proportions of 7.6% (P=0.019), 4.2% (P=0.035), and 9.1% (P=0.013), respectively.The current MR study provides evidence supporting the causal relationships between several specific GM taxa and stroke and potential mediating metabolites."

Therefore, this study aimed to identify novel genetic loci associated with HRV and assess the association of phenotypic HRV and genetically predicted HRV with mortality. In a GWAS of 46,075 European ancestry individuals from UK biobank, we identified 17 independent genome-wide significant genetic variants in 16 loci associated with HRV traits. Notably, eight of these loci (RNF220, GNB4, LINCR-002, KLHL3/HNRNPA0, CHRM2, KCNJ5, MED13L, and C160rf72) have not been reported previously. In a prospective phenotypic relationship between HRV and mortality during a median follow-up of seven years, individuals with lower HRV had higher risk of dying from any cause. Genetically predicted HRV, as determined by the genetic risk scores, was not associated with mortality. To the best of our knowledge, the findings provide novel biological insights into the mechanisms underlying HRV.

Twenty-six signals are classified as fetal, four maternal and three fetal and maternal. A maternal parent-of-origin effect is seen near KCNQ1. Genetic correlation and colocalization analyses reveal overlap with birth weight genetics, but 12 loci are classified as predominantly or only affecting placental weight, with connections to placental development and morphology, and transport of antibodies and amino acids.

Analysing 8,153 longitudinal MRIs from 3,893 healthy adults, we found no evidence for an association between sleep duration and brain atrophy. In contrast, cross-sectional analyses (51,295 observations) showed inverse U-shaped relationships, where a duration of 6.5 (95% confidence interval, (5.7, 7.3)) hours was associated with the thickest cortex and largest volumes relative to intracranial volume. This fits converging evidence from research on mortality, health and cognition that points to roughly seven hours being associated with good health. Genome-wide association analyses suggested that genes associated with longer sleep for below-average sleepers were linked to shorter sleep for above-average sleepers.

While vegetarianism has been practiced for millennia in various societies, its practitioners remain a small minority of people worldwide, and the role of genetics in choosing a vegetarian diet is not well understood. Dietary choices involve an interplay between the physiologic effects of dietary items, their metabolism, and taste perception, all of which are strongly influenced by genetics. In this study, we used a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify loci associated with strict vegetarianism in UK Biobank participants. Comparing 5,324 strict vegetarians to 329,455 controls, we identified one SNP on chromosome 18 that is associated with vegetarianism at the genome-wide significant level (rs72884519, β = -0.11, P = 4.997 x 10-8), and an additional 201 suggestively significant variants. Four genes are associated with rs72884519: TMEM241, RIOK3, NPC1, and RMC1. Using the Functional Mapping and Annotation (FUMA) platform and the Multi-marker Analysis of GenoMic Annotation (MAGMA) tool, we identified 34 genes with a possible role in vegetarianism, 3 of which are GWAS-significant based on gene-level analysis: RIOK3, RMC1, and NPC1. Several of the genes associated with vegetarianism, including TMEM241, NPC1, and RMC1, have important functions in lipid metabolism and brain function, raising the possibility that differences in lipid metabolism and their effects on the brain may underlie the ability to subsist on a vegetarian diet. These results support a role for genetics in choosing a vegetarian diet and open the door to future studies aimed at further elucidating the physiologic pathways involved in vegetarianism.Copyright: © 2023 Yaseen et al.

Our objective is to characterize the shared genetic architecture of bipolar disorder (BD), major depression (MD), and schizophrenia (SZ) with white matter fractional anisotropy (FA) and identify shared genetic loci to uncover biological underpinnings. We used genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics for BD (n = 413,466), MD (n = 420,359), SZ (n = 320,404), and white matter FA (n = 33,292) to uncover the genetic architecture (i.e., polygenicity and discoverability) of each phenotype and their genetic overlap (i.e., genetic correlations, overlapping trait-influencing variants, and shared loci). This revealed that BD, MD, and SZ are at least 7-times more polygenic and less genetically discoverable than average FA. Even in the presence of weak genetic correlations (range = -0.05 to -0.09), average FA shared an estimated 42.5%, 43.0%, and 90.7% of trait-influencing variants as well as 12, 4, and 28 shared loci with BD, MD, and SZ, respectively. Shared variants were mapped to genes and tested for enrichment among gene-sets which implicated neurodevelopmental expression, neural cell types, myelin, and cell adhesion molecules. For BD and SZ, case vs control tract-level differences in FA associated with genetic correlations between those same tracts and the respective disorder (rBD = 0.83, p = 4.99e-7 and rSZ = 0.65, p = 5.79e-4). Genetic overlap at the tract-level was consistent with average FA results.

Here, we study the phenotypic and genetic factor structures of ten psychiatric conditions using UK Biobank and public genomic data. Although the factor structure of psychopathology was generally genetically and phenotypically consistent, conditions related to externalizing (e.g., alcohol use disorder) and compulsivity (e.g., eating disorders) exhibited cross-level disparities in their relationships with other conditions, plausibly due to environmental influences. Domain-level factors, especially thought disorder and internalizing factors, were more informative than a general psychopathology factor in genome-wide association and polygenic index analyses. Collectively, our findings enhance the understanding of comorbidity and shared etiology, highlight the intricate interplay between genes and environment, and offer guidance for psychiatric research using polygenic indices."

Here, we show, through theory, simulations and applications to real data, that adjustment of GWAS analyses for polygenic scores (PGSs) increases the statistical power for discovery across all ancestries. We applied this method to analyze seven traits available in three large biobanks with participants of East Asian ancestry (n = 340,000 in total) and report 139 additional associations across traits. We also present a two-stage meta-analysis strategy whereby, in contributing cohorts, a PGS-adjusted GWAS is rerun using PGSs derived from a first round of a standard meta-analysis. On average, across traits, this approach yields a 1.26-fold increase in the number of detected associations (range 1.07- to 1.76-fold increase). Altogether, our study demonstrates the value of using PGSs to increase the power of GWASs in underrepresented populations and promotes such an analytical strategy for future GWAS meta-analyses.© 2023.

Neuroimaging features have demonstrated the capacity to distinguish cognitive decline changes stemming from typical brain aging and Alzheimer's disease between different chronological points.We developed a deep-learning framework based on dual-loss Siamese ResNet network to extract fine-grained information from the longitudinal structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. We then conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and post-GWAS analyses to reveal the genetic basis of AD-related accelerated cognitive decline.We used our model to process data from 1,313 individuals, training it on 414 cognitively normal people and predicting cognitive assessment for all participants. In our analysis of accelerated cognitive decline GWAS, we identified two genome-wide significant loci:APOElocus (chromosome 19 p13.32) and rs144614292 (chromosome 11 p15.1). Variant rs144614292 (G>T) has not been reported in previous AD GWA studies. It is within the intronic region ofNELL1, which is expressed in neuron and plays a role in controlling cell growth and differentiation. In addition,MUC7andPROL1/OPRPNon chromosome 4 were significant at the gene level. The cell-type-specific enrichment analysis and functional enrichment of GWAS signals highlighted the microglia and immune-response pathways. Furthermore, we found that the cognitive decline slope GWAS was positively correlated with previous AD GWAS.Our deep learning model was demonstrated effective on extracting relevant neuroimaging features and predicting individual cognitive decline. We reported a novel variant (rs144614292) within theNELL1gene. Our approach has the potential to disentangle accelerated cognitive decline from the normal aging process and to determine its related genetic factors, leveraging opportunities for early intervention."
"456",37713023,NA,NA,"Proprietary genetic datasets are valuable for boosting the statistical power of genome-wide association studies (GWASs), but their use can restrict investigators from publicly sharing the resulting summary statistics. Although researchers can resort to sharing down-sampled versions that exclude restricted data, down-sampling reduces power and might change the genetic etiology of the phenotype being studied. These problems are further complicated when using multivariate GWAS methods, such as genomic structural equation modeling (Genomic SEM), that model genetic correlations across multiple traits. Here, we propose a systematic approach to assess the comparability of GWAS summary statistics that include versus exclude restricted data. Illustrating this approach with a multivariate GWAS of an externalizing factor, we assessed the impact of down-sampling on (1) the strength of the genetic signal in univariate GWASs, (2) the factor loadings and model fit in multivariate Genomic SEM, (3) the strength of the genetic signal at the factor level, (4) insights from gene-property analyses, (5) the pattern of genetic correlations with other traits, and (6) polygenic score analyses in independent samples. For the externalizing GWAS, although down-sampling resulted in a loss of genetic signal and fewer genome-wide significant loci; the factor loadings and model fit, gene-property analyses, genetic correlations, and polygenic score analyses were found robust. Given the importance of data sharing for the advancement of open science, we recommend that investigators who generate and share down-sampled summary statistics report these analyses as accompanying documentation to support other researchers' use of the summary statistics.© 2023.

Here we investigated the shared genetic architecture between cognitive traits (intelligence (INT) and educational attainment (EDU)), and risk loci jointly associated with ASD and the cognitive traits. We analyzed data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of INT (n = 269,867), EDU (n = 766,345) and ASD (cases n = 18,381, controls n = 27,969). We used the bivariate causal mixture model (MiXeR) to estimate the total number of shared genetic variants, local analysis of co-variant annotation (LAVA) to estimate local genetic correlations, conditional false discovery rate (cond/conjFDR) to identify specific overlapping loci. The MiXeR analyses showed that 12.7k genetic variants are associated with ASD, of which 12.0k variants are shared with EDU, and 11.1k are shared with INT with both positive and negative relationships within overlapping variants. The majority (59-68%) of estimated shared loci have concordant effect directions, with a positive, albeit modest, genetic correlation between ASD and EDU (rg = 0.21, p = 2e-13) and INT (rg = 0.22, p = 4e-12). We discovered 43 loci jointly associated with ASD and cognitive traits (conjFDR<0.05), of which 27 were novel for ASD. Functional analysis revealed significant differential expression of candidate genes in the cerebellum and frontal cortex. To conclude, we quantified the genetic architecture shared between ASD and cognitive traits, demonstrated mixed effect directions, and identified the associated genetic loci and molecular pathways. The findings suggest that common genetic risk factors for ASD can underlie both better and worse cognitive functioning across the ASD spectrum, with different underlying biology.© 2023.

However, there is limited evidence concerning the causal association of LTL with benign and malignant meningiomas or with the location of benign tumors.We used three LTL datasets from different sources, designated by name and sample size as LTL-78592, LTL-9190, and LTL-472174. The linkage disequilibrium score (LDSC) was used to explore the association between LTL and meningioma. We utilized two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization (TSMR) to evaluate whether LTL is causally related to meningioma risk. We adjusted for confounders by conducting multivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR).In the LTL-78592, longer LTL was significantly associated with increased risk of malignant [odds ratio (OR) = 5.14,p = 1.04 × 10-5], benign (OR = 4.81,p < 0.05), benign cerebral (OR = 5.36,p < 0.05), and benign unspecified meningioma (OR = 8.26,p < 0.05). The same results were obtained for the LTL-9190. In the LTL-472174, longer LTL was significantly associated with increased risk of malignant (OR = 4.94,p < 0.05), benign (OR = 3.14,p < 0.05), and benign cerebral meningioma (OR = 3.59,p < 0.05). Similar results were obtained in the MVMR. In contrast, only benign cerebral meningioma displayed a possible association with longer LTL (OR = 1.01,p < 0.05). No heterogeneity or horizontal pleiotropy was detected.In brief, genetically predicted longer LTL may increase the risk of benign, malignant, and benign cerebral meningiomas, regardless of the LTL measure, in European populations.Copyright © 2023 Yu, Mei, Lu, Zhou, Jia, Chen and Wang."

We integrate sequence and genotype array data in up to 482,378 UK Biobank participants to demonstrate shared genetic architecture across CH types. Our analysis suggests a cellular evolutionary trade-off between different types of CH, with LOY occurring at lower rates in individuals carrying mutations in established CHIP genes. We observed co-occurrence of CHIP and mCAs with overlap at TET2, DNMT3A, and JAK2, in which CHIP precedes mCA acquisition. Furthermore, individuals carrying overlapping CH had high risk of future lymphoid and myeloid malignancies. Finally, we leverage shared genetic architecture of CH traits to identify 15 novel loci associated with leukemia risk.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."

Recent work leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) has offered promise to dissect this heterogeneity by identifying complex intermediate phenotypes - herein called dimensional neuroimaging endophenotypes (DNEs) - which subtype various neurologic and neuropsychiatric diseases. We investigate the presence of nine such DNEs derived from independent yet harmonized studies on Alzheimer's disease (AD1-2)1, autism spectrum disorder (ASD1-3)2, late-life depression (LLD1-2)3, and schizophrenia (SCZ1-2)4, in the general population of 39,178 participants in the UK Biobank study. Phenome-wide associations revealed prominent associations between the nine DNEs and phenotypes related to the brain and other human organ systems. This phenotypic landscape aligns with the SNP-phenotype genome-wide associations, revealing 31 genomic loci associated with the nine DNEs (Bonferroni corrected P-value < 5×10-8/9). The DNEs exhibited significant genetic correlations, colocalization, and causal relationships with multiple human organ systems and chronic diseases. A causal effect (odds ratio=1.25 [1.11, 1.40], P-value=8.72×1-4) was established from AD2, characterized by focal medial temporal lobe atrophy, to AD. The nine DNEs and their polygenic risk scores significantly improved the prediction accuracy for 14 systemic disease categories and mortality. These findings underscore the potential of the nine DNEs to identify individuals at a high risk of developing the four brain diseases during preclinical stages for precision diagnostics.

Understanding whether this heterogeneity is driven by genetic variation is a key aim of pharmacogenetics and could influence precision medicine approaches in inflammatory diseases. Using changes in disease activity scores across 5,218 genotyped individuals from 19 clinical trials across four indications (psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis, and rheumatoid arthritis), we tested whether genetics predicted response to secukinumab. We did not find any evidence of association between treatment response and common variants, imputed HLA alleles, polygenic risk scores of disease susceptibility, or cross-disease components of shared genetic risk. This suggests that anti-IL17 therapy is equally effective regardless of an individual's genetic background, a finding that has important implications for future genetic studies of biological therapy response in inflammatory diseases.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

The combined effect of genetic and epigenetic changes on hypertension is not known. We evaluated the independent and interactive association ofMTHFRrs1801133 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) andMTHFRpromoter methylation with hypertension among Taiwanese adults.We retrieved data including,MTHFRpromoter methylation,MTHFRrs1801133 genotypes (CC, CT, and TT), basic demography, personal lifestyle habits, and disease history of 1,238 individuals from the Taiwan Biobank (TWB).The distributions of hypertension andMTHFRpromoter methylation quartiles (β < 0.1338, 0.1338 ≤ β < 0.1385, 0.1385 ≤ β < 0.1423, and β ≥ 0.1423 corresponding to <Q1, Q1-Q2, Q2-Q3, and ≥Q3) among individuals with the rs1801133 genotypes (CC, CT, and TT) were significantly different (P < 0.05). The risk of hypertension was significantly higher among individuals with the TT genotype compared to the reference genotype (CC): odds ratio (OR); 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.718; 1.503-4.914. The trend of the association of the CT and TT genotypes with hypertension was dose-dependent (P-trend = 0.0041).MTHFRpromoter methylation (lower quartiles compared to ≥Q3) was not significantly associated with hypertension. However, its interaction withMTHFRrs1801133 was significant (P = 0.0323). After stratification by rs1801133 genotypes, lowerMTHFRpromoter methylation quartiles (<Q1, Q1-Q2, Q2-Q3) compared to ≥Q3 were significantly associated with a higher risk of hypertension among individuals carrying the CC genotype: ORs (95% CIs) = 3.225 (1.140-9.124), 4.177 (1.424-12.247), and 8.645 (2.513-29.739) for Q2-Q3, Q1-Q2, and <Q1, respectively. The trend test was significant (P-trend = 0.0009).Independently, rs1801133 TT was associated with a higher risk of hypertension, but methylation was not. Based on genotypes, lower methylation was dose-dependently associated with a higher risk of hypertension in individuals with the CC genotype.

Three functional variants in the SCN9A gene (encoding M932L, V991L, and D1908G in Nav1.7), have recently been identified as stemming from Neanderthal introgression and to associate with pain symptomatology in UK BioBank data. In 1000 genomes data, these variants are absent in Europeans but common in Latin Americans. Analysing high-density genotype data from 7594 Latin Americans, we characterized Neanderthal introgression in SCN9A. We find that tracts of introgression occur on a Native American genomic background, have an average length of ~123 kb and overlap the M932L, V991L, and D1908G coding positions. Furthermore, we measured experimentally six pain thresholds in 1623 healthy Colombians. We found that Neanderthal ancestry in SCN9A is significantly associated with a lower mechanical pain threshold after sensitization with mustard oil and evidence of additivity of effects across Nav1.7 variants. Our findings support the reported association of Neanderthal Nav1.7 variants with clinical pain, define a specific sensory modality affected by archaic introgression in SCN9A and are consistent with independent effects of the Neanderthal variants on Nav1.7 function.© 2023.

Here, we generate a high-coverage genome with low contamination (15.3×) to gain further insights into the genetic history and phenotype of this individual. Contrary to previous studies, we found no detectable Steppe-related ancestry in the Iceman. Instead, he retained the highest Anatolian-farmer-related ancestry among contemporaneous European populations, indicating a rather isolated Alpine population with limited gene flow from hunter-gatherer-ancestry-related populations. Phenotypic analysis revealed that the Iceman likely had darker skin than present-day Europeans and carried risk alleles associated with male-pattern baldness, type 2 diabetes, and obesity-related metabolic syndrome.

"465",37816864,"Positive regulation of oxidative phosphorylation by nuclear myosin 1 protects cells from metabolic reprogramming and tumorigenesis in mice.","Nat Commun","Metabolic reprogramming is one of the hallmarks of tumorigenesis. Here, we show that nuclear myosin 1 (NM1) serves as a key regulator of cellular metabolism. NM1 directly affects mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) by regulating mitochondrial transcription factors TFAM and PGC1α, and its deletion leads to underdeveloped mitochondria inner cristae and mitochondrial redistribution within the cell. These changes are associated with reduced OXPHOS gene expression, decreased mitochondrial DNA copy number, and deregulated mitochondrial dynamics, which lead to metabolic reprogramming of NM1 KO cells from OXPHOS to aerobic glycolysis.This, in turn, is associated with a metabolomic profile typical for cancer cells, namely increased amino acid-, fatty acid-, and sugar metabolism, and increased glucose uptake, lactate production, and intracellular acidity. NM1 KO cells form solid tumors in a mouse model, suggesting that the metabolic switch towards aerobic glycolysis provides a sufficient carcinogenic signal. We suggest that NM1 plays a role as a tumor suppressor and that NM1 depletion may contribute to the Warburg effect at the onset of tumorigenesis.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."

However, knowledge of the topological rearrangement of genomic hierarchical layers in cancer is largely limited. Here, by taking advantage of in situ Hi-C, RNA-sequencing, and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), we investigated structural reorganization and functional changes in chromosomal compartments, topologically associated domains (TADs), and CCCTC binding factor (CTCF)-mediated loops in gallbladder cancer (GBC) tissues and cell lines. We observed that the chromosomal compartment A/B switch was correlated with CTCF binding levels and gene expression changes. Increased inter-TAD interactions with weaker TAD boundaries were identified in cancer cell lines relative to normal controls. Furthermore, the chromatin short loops and cancer unique loops associated with chromatin remodeling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition activation were enriched in cancer compared with their control counterparts. Cancer-specific enhancer-promoter loops, which contain multiple transcription factor binding motifs, acted as a central element to regulate aberrant gene expression. Depletion of individual enhancers in each loop anchor that connects with promoters led to the inhibition of their corresponding gene expressions. Collectively, our data offer the landscape of hierarchical layers of cancer genome and functional alterations that contribute to the development of GBC.© 2023. Higher Education Press."

The hippocampal BOLD-CBF correlation had an estimated heritability of 16.2-23.9% and showed reliable genome-wide significant association with a locus at 3q28, in which many variants have been linked to neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid markers of Alzheimer's disease. Gene-based association analyses showed four significant genes (GMNC,CRTC2,DENND4B, andGATAD2B) and revealed enrichment for mast cell calcium mobilization, microglial cell proliferation, and ubiquitin-related proteolysis pathways that regulate different cellular components of the neurovascular unit.

Elucidation of the mechanisms underlying gamete development in vivo has inspired scientists to attempt to recapitulate the entire process of gametogenesis in vitro. While earlier studies have established IVG methods largely using pluripotent stem cells of embryonic origin, the scarcity of sources for these cells and the ethical issues involved in their use are serious limitations to the progress of IVG research especially in humans. However, with the emergence of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) due to the revolutionary discovery of dedifferentiation and reprogramming factors, IVG research has progressed remarkably in the last decade. This paper extensively reviews developments in IVG using iPSCs. First, the paper presents key concepts from groundwork studies on IVG including earlier researches demonstrating that IVG methods using embryonic stem cells (ESCs) also apply when using iPSCs. Techniques for the derivation of iPSCs are briefly discussed, highlighting the importance of generating transgene-free iPSCs with a high capacity for germline transmission to improve efficacy when used for IVG. The main part of the paper discusses recent advances in IVG research using iPSCs in various stages of gametogenesis. In addition, current clinical applications of IVG are presented, and potential future applications are discussed. Although IVG is still faced with many challenges in terms of technical issues, as well as efficacy and safety, novel IVG methodologies are emerging, and IVG using iPSCs may usher in the next era of reproductive medicine sooner than expected. This raises both ethical and social concerns and calls for the scientific community to cautiously develop IVG technology to ensure it is not only efficacious but also safe and adheres to social and ethical norms.© 2023.

"469",37724166,"Developmental origins of adult diseases.","Med Rev (Berl)","The occurrence and mechanisms of developmental adult diseases have gradually attracted attention in recent years. Exposure of gametes and embryos to adverse environments, especially during plastic development, can alter the expression of certain tissue-specific genes, leading to increased susceptibility to certain diseases in adulthood, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, neuropsychiatric, and reproductive system diseases, etc. The occurrence of chronic disease in adulthood is partly due to genetic factors, and the remaining risk is partly due to environmental-dependent epigenetic information alteration, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and noncoding RNAs. Changes in this epigenetic information potentially damage our health, which has also been supported by numerous epidemiological and animal studies in recent years. Environmental factors functionally affect embryo development through epimutation, transmitting diseases to offspring and even later generations. This review mainly elaborated on the concept of developmental origins of adult diseases, and revealed the epigenetic mechanisms underlying these events, discussed the theoretical basis for the prevention and treatment of related diseases.© 2022 the author(s), published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston."

Data in humans are really limited and indirect. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to explore the possible existence of a link between OT and BDNF in humans, by means of two peripheral markers, the platelet-poor-plasmatic-BDNF (PPP-BDNF) and the platelet BDNF (PLT-BDNF) and OT levels. Twenty-six young healthy controls of both sexes who volunteered for the study were included in the study. Fifty ml of peripheral venous blood were drawn from one-night fasting subjects between 8.00 and 9.00 a.m. The BDNF and OT assays were carried out according to common methods. Comparisons for continuous variables were performed by the Student's t-test for variables that follow a normal distribution, and by the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test for variables not normally distributed. The correlations between biological markers were explored by calculating the Pearson's correlation coefficient or Spearman's rank correlation. The results showed that PLT-BDNF (pg/mg proteins, mean ± SD) and PPP-BDNF (pg/ml, mean ± SD) were 1546 ± 1844 and 10111 ± 1892, respectively. The OT levels (pg/ml, mean ± SD) were 13.92 ± 4.54. The OT levels were significantly higher in women than in men. The Spearman's analysis revealed a statistically significant and negative correlation between OT levels and PLT-BDNF (R = -0.543, p = 0.004). The findings of this study highlight the presence of a significant and negative correlation between OT and PLT-BDNF in a small group of healthy controls of both sexes. In any case, despite all the limits of peripheral biomarkers, they suggest that this reciprocal influence might have a downstream homeostatic function dampening one activity when the other is activated or no longer necessary, maybe at the level of the stress and/or immune systems.© 2023 The Authors."

A complete understanding of this network requires new approaches to accurately measure the subtle m6A differences arising from genetic variants, many of which have been associated with common diseases. To address this gap, we developed a method to accurately and sensitively detect transcriptome-wide allele-specific m6A (ASm6A) from MeRIP-seq data and applied it to uncover 12,056 high-confidence ASm6A modifications from 25 human tissues. We also identified 1184 putative functional variants for ASm6A regulation, a subset of which we experimentally validated. Importantly, we found that many of these ASm6A-associated genetic variants were enriched for common disease-associated and complex trait-associated risk loci, and verified that two disease risk variants can change m6A modification status. Together, this work provides a tool to detangle the dynamic network of RNA modifications at the allelic level and highlights the interplay of m6A and genetics in human health and disease.© 2023 Cao et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press."

We recruited a total of 759 Korean participants who underwent neuropsychological tests, brain magnetic resonance imaging,18F-flutemetamol positron emission tomography, and microarray genotyping data. We performed gene-based association analysis, and also performed expression quantitative trait loci and network analysis. In genome-wide association studies, no single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) passed the genome-wide significance threshold. In gene-based association analysis, six genes (LCMT1,SCRN2,LRRC46,MRPL10,SP6, andOSBPL7) were significantly associated with Aβ standardised uptake value ratio in the brain. The three most significant SNPs (rs4787307, rs9903904, and rs11079797) on these genes are associated with the regulation of theLCMT1,OSBPL7, andSCRN2genes, respectively. These SNPs are involved in decreasing hippocampal volume and cognitive scores by mediating Aβ uptake. The 19 enriched gene sets identified by pathway analysis included axon and chemokine activity. Our findings suggest novel susceptibility genes associated with the uptake of Aβ, which in turn leads to worse clinical outcomes.

Using persistent homology, this study explores the evolution and persistence of the topological features of T2D GWAS hits in the PPI network with increasingp-value thresholds. We define ann-dimensional persistent disease module as a higher-order generalization of the largest connected component (LCC). The 0-dimensional persistent T2D disease module is the LCC of the T2D GWAS hits, which is significantly detected in the PPI network (196 nodes and 235 edges, P<0.05). In the 1-dimensional homology group analysis, all 18 1-dimensional holes (loops) of the T2D GWAS hits persist over allp-value thresholds. The 1-dimensional persistent T2D disease module comprising these 18 persistent 1-dimensional holes is significantly larger than that expected by chance (59 nodes and 83 edges, P<0.001), indicating a significant topological structure in the PPI network.

However, many of these existing methods are focused on integrating additional data that are only available for a small subset of diseases or conditions.We have designed and implemented a new R-based open-source target prioritization and repurposing method that integrates both canonical intracellular signaling information from five public pathway databases and target information from public sources including OpenTargets.org. The Pathway2Targets algorithm takes a list of significant pathways as input, then retrieves and integrates public data for all targets within those pathways for a given condition. It also incorporates a weighting scheme that is customizable by the user to support a variety of use cases including target prioritization, drug repurposing, and identifying novel targets that are biologically relevant for a different indication.As a proof of concept, we applied this algorithm to a public colorectal cancer RNA-sequencing dataset with 144 case and control samples. Our analysis identified 430 targets and ~700 unique drugs based on differential gene expression and signaling pathway enrichment. We found that our highest-ranked predicted targets were significantly enriched in targets with FDA-approved therapeutics for colorectal cancer (p-value < 0.025) that included EGFR, VEGFA, and PTGS2. Interestingly, there was no statistically significant enrichment of targets for other cancers in this same list suggesting high specificity of the results. We also adjusted the weighting scheme to prioritize more novel targets for CRC. This second analysis revealed epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K), and two mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK14 and MAPK3). These observations suggest that our open-source method with a customizable weighting scheme can accurately prioritize targets that are specific and relevant to the disease or condition of interest, as well as targets that are at earlier stages of development. We anticipate that this method will complement other approaches to repurpose drugs for a variety of indications, which can contribute to the improvement of the quality of life and overall health of such patients.© 2023 Dobbs Spendlove et al."

The primary symptoms of HD include motor dysfunction such as chorea, dystonia, and involuntary movements. The primary motor cortex (BA4) is the key brain region responsible for executing motor/movement activities. Investigating patient and control samples from the BA4 region will provide a deeper understanding of the genes responsible for neuron degeneration and help to identify potential markers. Previous studies have focused on overall differential gene expression and associated biological functions. In this study, we illustrate the relationship between variants and differentially expressed genes/transcripts. We identified variants and their associated genes along with the quantification of genes and transcripts. We also predicted the effect of variants on various regulatory activities and found that many variants are regulating gene expression. Variants affecting miRNA and its targets are also highlighted in our study. Co-expression network studies revealed the role of novel genes. Function interaction network analysis unveiled the importance of genes involved in vesicle-mediated transport. From this unified approach, we propose that genes expressed in immune cells are crucial for reducing neuron death in HD."

Perception of sound (PoS), 2. Acoustic stimulation (AcouStim), and 3. Tinnitus (Tin). Enrichment analysis by the DAVID database resulted in similar Gene Ontology (GO) terms for cellular components in all gene lists, reflecting synaptic structures known to be involved in auditory processing. The STRING protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and the Cytoscape data analyzer were used to identify the top two high-degree proteins (HDPs) and their high-score interaction proteins (HSIPs) identified by the combined score (CS) of the corresponding edges. The top two protein pairs (key proteins) for the PoS are BDNF-GDNF and OTOF-CACNA1D and for the AcouStim process BDNF-NTRK2 and TH-CALB1. The Tin process showed BDNF and NGF as HDPs, with high-score interactions with NTRK1 and NGFR at a comparable level. Compared to the PoS and AcouStim process, the number of HSIPs of key proteins (CS > 90. percentile) increases strongly in Tin. In the PoS and AcouStim networks, BDNF receptor signaling is the dominant pathway, and in the Tin network, the NGF-signaling pathway is of similar importance. Key proteins and their HSIPs are good indicators of biological processes and of signaling pathways characteristic for the normal hearing on the one hand and tinnitus on the other.© 2023.

ASD is a multifactorial disease with a complex polygenic genetic architecture. Its genetic contributing factors are not yet fully understood, especially large structural variations (SVs). In this study, we aimed to assess the contribution of SVs, including copy number variants (CNVs), insertions, deletions, duplications, and mobile element insertions, to ASD and related language impairments in the New Jersey Language and Autism Genetics Study (NJLAGS) cohort. Within the cohort, ~77% of the families contain SVs that followed expected segregation or de novo patterns and passed our filtering criteria. These SVs affected 344 brain-expressed genes and can potentially contribute to the genetic etiology of the disorders. Gene Ontology and protein-protein interaction network analysis suggested several clusters of genes in different functional categories, such as neuronal development and histone modification machinery. Genes and biological processes identified in this study contribute to the understanding of ASD and related neurodevelopment disorders."

CharacterizingP. aeruginosatranscription in the CF lung and identifying factors that drive gene expression could yield novel strategies to eradicate infection or otherwise improve outcomes. To complement publishedP. aeruginosagene expression studies in laboratory culture models designed to model the CF lung environment, we employed an ex vivo sputum model in which laboratory strain PAO1 was incubated in sputum from different CF donors. As part of the analysis, we compared PAO1 gene expression in this ""spike-in"" sputum model to that forP. aeruginosagrown in artificial sputum medium (ASM). Analyses focused on genes that were differentially expressed between sputum and ASM and genes that were most highly expressed in sputum. We present a new approach that used sets of genes with correlated expression, identified by the gene expression analysis tool eADAGE, to analyze the differential activity of pathways inP. aeruginosagrown in CF sputum from different individuals. A key characteristic ofP. aeruginosagrown in expectorated CF sputum was related to zinc and iron acquisition, but this signal varied by donor sputum. In addition, a significant correlation betweenP. aeruginosaexpression of the H1-type VI secretion system and corrector use by the sputum donor was observed. These methods may be broadly useful in looking for variable signals across clinical samples."

To fill this gap in knowledge, here we characterize the chromatin accessibility landscape in pediatric relapsed B-ALL. We observe rewired accessible chromatin regions (ACRs) associated with transcription dysregulation in leukemia cells as compared with normal B-cell progenitors. We show that over a quarter of the ACRs in B-ALL are in quiescent regions with high heterogeneity among B-ALLs. We identify subtype-specific and allele-imbalanced chromatin accessibility by integrating multi-omics data. By characterizing the differential ACRs between diagnosis and relapse in B-ALL, we identify alterations in chromatin accessibility during drug treatment. Further analysis of ACRs associated with relapse free survival leads to the identification of a subgroup of B-ALL which show early relapse. These data provide an advanced and integrative portrait of the importance of chromatin accessibility alterations in tumorigenesis and drug responses.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."

Across both regions, we observed notable differences in neuronal chromatin accessibility between schizophrenia cases and controls. A per-sample disease pseudotime was positively associated with genetic liability for schizophrenia. Organizing chromatin intocis- andtrans-regulatory domains, identified a prominent neuronaltrans-regulatory domain (TRD1) active in immature glutamatergic neurons during fetal development.

To tackle this problem, we here use epigenomic and transcriptomic data from 13 ENCODE cell types to train machine learning models to predict gene expression from histone post-translational modifications (PTMs), achieving transcriptome-wide correlations of ~ 0.70 - 0.79 for most samples. In addition to recapitulating known associations between histone PTMs and expression patterns, our models predict that acetylation of histone subunit H3 lysine residue 27 (H3K27ac) near the transcription start site (TSS) significantly increases expression levels. To validate this prediction experimentally and investigate how engineered vs. natural deposition of H3K27ac might differentially affect expression, we apply the synthetic dCas9-p300 histone acetyltransferase system to 8 genes in the HEK293T cell line. Further, to facilitate model building, we perform MNase-seq to map genome-wide nucleosome occupancy levels in HEK293T. We observe that our models perform well in accurately ranking relative fold changes among genes in response to the dCas9-p300 system; however, their ability to rank fold changes within individual genes is noticeably diminished compared to predicting expression across cell types from their native epigenetic signatures. Our findings highlight the need for more comprehensive genome-scale epigenome editing datasets, better understanding of the actual modifications made by epigenome editing tools, and improved causal models that transfer better from endogenous cellular measurements to perturbation experiments. Together these improvements would facilitate the ability to understand and predictably control the dynamic human epigenome with consequences for human health."

We performed a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) on 5,173 fine-mapped schizophrenia GWAS variants in primary human neural progenitors and identified 439 variants with allelic regulatory effects (MPRA-positive variants). Transcription factor binding had modest predictive power, while fine-map posterior probability, enhancer overlap, and evolutionary conservation failed to predict MPRA-positive variants. Furthermore, 64% of MPRA-positive variants did not exhibit expressive quantitative trait loci signature, suggesting that MPRA could identify yet unexplored variants with regulatory potentials. To predict the combinatorial effect of MPRA-positive variants on gene regulation, we propose an accessibility-by-contact model that combines MPRA-measured allelic activity with neuronal chromatin architecture.© 2023 The Author(s)."

Methylation-based assays offer a promising approach, as DNA methylation patterns can change in response to tissue damage. These assays have potential applications in early detection, monitoring disease progression, evaluating treatment efficacy, and assessing organ viability for transplantation. cfDNA released into the bloodstream upon tissue or organ injury can serve as a biomarker for damage. The epigenetic state of cfDNA, including DNA methylation patterns, can provide insights into the extent of tissue and organ damage.Firstly, this review highlights DNA methylation as an extensively studied epigenetic modification that plays a pivotal role in processes such as cell growth, differentiation, and disease development. It then presents a variety of highly precise 5-mC methylation detection techniques that serve as powerful tools for gaining profound insights into epigenetic alterations linked with tissue damage. Subsequently, the review delves into the mechanisms underlying DNA methylation changes in organ and tissue damage, encompassing inflammation, oxidative stress, and DNA damage repair mechanisms. Next, it addresses the current research status of cfDNA methylation in the detection of specific organ tissues and organ damage. Finally, it provides an overview of the multiple steps involved in identifying specific methylation markers associated with tissue and organ damage for clinical trials.

To this end, we have calculated the global schizophrenia Polygenic Risk Score (Global PRSSZ) and that specific to HARs (HARs PRSSZ).

VISs were enriched in the nuclear subcompartment A1 and integrated into super-enhancers close to nuclear pore complexes. These signatures were validated in T cells transduced with an LV encoding a CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptor. Intriguingly, the one patient whose VISs deviated from the identified integrome signatures had a distinct clinical course. Comparison of LV and gamma retrovirus integromes regarding their 3D genome signatures identified differences that might explain the lower risk of insertional mutagenesis in LV-based gene therapy.

The 3p21.31 locus contains several genes encoding chemokine receptors potentially relevant to severe COVID-19. In particular, CXCR6, which is prominently expressed in T lymphocytes, NK, and NKT cells, has been shown to be involved in the recruitment of immune cells to non-lymphoid organs in chronic inflammatory and respiratory diseases. In COVID-19, CXCR6 expression is reduced in lung resident memory T cells from patients with severe disease as compared to the control cohort with moderate symptoms. We demonstrate here that rs71327024 is located within an active enhancer that augments the activity of theCXCR6promoter in human CD4+T lymphocytes. The common rs71327024(G) variant makes a functional binding site for the c-Myb transcription factor, while the risk rs71327024(T) variant disrupts c-Myb binding and reduces the enhancer activity. Concordantly, c-Myb knockdown in PMA-treated Jurkat cells negates rs71327024's allele-specific effect onCXCR6promoter activity. We conclude that a disrupted c-Myb binding site may decrease CXCR6 expression in T helper cells of individuals carrying the minor rs71327024(T) allele and thus may promote the progression of severe COVID-19 and other inflammatory pathologies."

Among these mechanisms, N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-modified long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as key players. However, the precise roles of m6A-modified lncRNAs in PCa remain to be elucidated. In this study, methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq) was conducted on primary and metastatic PCa samples, leading to the identification of 21 lncRNAs exhibiting differential methylation and expression patterns. We further established a PCa prognostic signature, named m6A-modified lncRNA score (mLs), based on 9 differential methylated lncRNAs in 4 multicenter cohorts. The high mLs score cohort exhibited a tendency for earlier biochemical recurrence (BCR) compared to the low mLs score cohort. Remarkably, the predictive performance of the mLs score surpassed that of five previously reported lncRNA-based signatures. Functional enrichment analysis underscored a negative correlation between the mLs score and lipid metabolism. Additionally, through MeRIP-qPCR, we pinpointed a hub gene, MIR210HG, which was validated through in vitro and in vivo experiments. These findings collectively illuminate the landscape of m6A-methylated lncRNAs in PCa tissue via MeRIP-seq and harness this information to prognosticate PCa outcomes using the mLs score. Furthermore, our study validates, both experimentally and mechanistically, the facilitative role of MIR210HG in driving PCa progression.© 2023.

While some of the STARR-seq peaks in repressive chromatin might be active in other cell/tissue types, some others might be false positives. Meanwhile, many active enhancers may not be identified by the current STARR-seq methods. Although methods have been proposed to mitigate systematic errors caused by the use of plasmid vectors, the artifacts due to the intrinsic limitations of current STARR-seq methods are still prevalent and the underlying causes are not fully understood.

Importantly, integrating multi-omics data using a systems bioinformatics approach will advance the understanding of the layered and interactive network of biological regulation that exchanges systemic knowledge to facilitate the development of a comprehensive human brain profile. In this review, we first summarize data mining studies utilizing datasets from the individual type of omics analysis, including epigenetics/epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, and spatial omics, pertaining to Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. We then discuss multi-omics integration approaches, including independent biological integration and unsupervised integration methods, for more intuitive and informative interpretation of the biological data obtained across different omics layers. We further assess studies that integrate multi-omics in data mining which provide convoluted biological insights and offer proof-of-concept proposition towards systems bioinformatics in the reconstruction of brain networks. Finally, we recommend a combination of high dimensional bioinformatics analysis with experimental validation to achieve translational neuroscience applications including biomarker discovery, therapeutic development, and elucidation of disease mechanisms.

ZNF evolution is highly dynamic and characterized by the rapid expansion and contraction of numerous subfamilies across the animal phylogeny. The forces and mechanisms underlying rapid ZNF evolution remain poorly understood, but there is growing evidence that, in tetrapods, the targeting and repression of lineage-specific transposable elements (TEs) plays a critical role in the evolution of the Krüppel-associated box ZNF (KZNF) subfamily. Currently, it is unknown whether this function and coevolutionary relationship is unique to KZNFs or is a broader feature of metazoan ZNFs. Here, we present evidence that genomic conflict with TEs has been a central driver of the diversification of ZNFs in animals. Sampling from 3221 genome assemblies, we show that the copy number of retroelements correlates with that of ZNFs across at least 750 million years of metazoan evolution. Using computational predictions, we show that ZNFs preferentially bind TEs in diverse animal species. We further investigate the largest ZNF subfamily found in cyprinid fish, which is characterized by a conserved sequence we dubbed the fish N-terminal zinc finger-associated (FiNZ) domain. Zebrafish possess approximately 700 FiNZ-ZNFs, many of which are evolving adaptively under positive selection. Like mammalian KZNFs, most zebrafish FiNZ-ZNFs are expressed at the onset of zygotic genome activation, and blocking their translation using morpholinos during early embryogenesis results in derepression of transcriptionally active TEs. Together, these data suggest that ZNF diversification has been intimately connected to TE expansion throughout animal evolution.© 2023 Wells et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press."

A recent advance in a high-throughput technology called loop-seq makes it possible to determine the bendability of hundred thousand 50-bp DNA duplexes in one experiment. However, it's still challenging to assess base-resolution sequence bendability in large genomes such as human, which requires thousands of such experiments. Here, we introduce 'BendNet'-a deep neural network to predict the intrinsic DNA bending at base-resolution by using loop-seq results in yeast as training data. BendNet can predict the DNA bendability of any given sequence from different species with high accuracy. To explore the utility of BendNet, we applied it to the human genome and observed DNA bendability is associated with chromatin features and disease risk regions involving transcription/enhancer regulation, DNA replication, transcription factor binding and extrachromosomal circular DNA generation. These findings expand our understanding on DNA mechanics and its association with transcription regulation in mammals. Lastly, we built a comprehensive resource of genomic DNA bendability profiles for 307 species by applying BendNet, and provided an online tool to assess the bendability of user-specified DNA sequences (http://www.dnabendnet.com/).© The Author(s) 2023.

In a genome-wide association study (GWAS) comprising 3,128 nAMD (1,555 PCV and 1,573 typical nAMD), and 5,493 controls of East Asian ancestry, we identify twelve loci, of which four are novel ([Formula: see text]). Substantial genetic sharing between PCV and typical nAMD is noted (rg= 0.666), whereas collagen extracellular matrix and fibrosis-related pathways are more pronounced for PCV. Whole-exome sequencing in 259 PCV patients revealed functional rare variants burden in collagen type I alpha 1 chain gene (COL1A1; [Formula: see text]) and potential enrichment of functional rare mutations at AMD-associated loci. At the GATA binding protein 5 (GATA5) locus, the most significant GWAS novel loci, the expressions of genes including laminin subunit alpha 5 (Lama5), mitochondrial ribosome associated GTPase 2 (Mtg2), and collagen type IX alpha 3 chain (Col9A3), are significantly induced during retinal angiogenesis and subretinal fibrosis in murine models. Furthermore, retinoic acid increased the expression of LAMA5 and MTG2 in vitro. Taken together, our data provide insights into the genetic basis of AMD pathogenesis in the Asian population.© 2023.

Each occurs at an approximate incidence of 1/15,000 to 1/30,000 live births and has a range of debilitating phenotypes. Patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have been valuable tools to understand human-relevant gene regulation at this locus and have contributed to the development of therapeutic approaches for AS. Nonetheless, gaps remain in our understanding of how these deletions contribute to dysregulation and phenotypes of AS and PWS. Variability across cell lines due to donor differences, reprogramming methods, and genetic background make it challenging to fill these gaps in knowledge without substantially increasing the number of cell lines used in the analyses. Isogenic cell lines that differ only by the genetic mutation causing the disease can ease this burden without requiring such a large number of cell lines. Here, we describe the development of isogenic human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines modeling the most common genetic subtypes of AS and PWS. These lines allow for a facile interrogation of allele-specific gene regulation at the chromosome 15q11-q13 locus. Additionally, these lines are an important resource to identify and test targeted therapeutic approaches for patients with AS and PWS."

As ctDNA-based liquid biopsy kits are developed and used in clinics, companies work towards increased convenience, accuracy, and cost over solid biopsies and other oncological markers. The technology used to differentiate ctDNA and cell-free DNA (cfDNA) continues to improve with new tests and methodologies being able to detect down to mutant allele frequencies of 0.001% or 1/100,000 copies. Recognizing this development in technology, the FDA has recently given pre-market approval and breakthrough device designations to multiple companies. The purpose of this review is to look at the utility of measuring total cfDNA, techniques used to differentiate ctDNA from cfDNA, and the utility of different ctDNA-based liquid biopsy kits using relevant articles from PubMed, clinicaltrials.gov, FDA approvals, and company newsletters. Measuring total cfDNA could be a cost-effective, viable prognostic marker, but various factors do not favor it as a monitoring tool during chemotherapy. While there may be a place in the clinic for measuring total cfDNA in the future, the lack of standardization means that it is difficult to move forward with large-scale clinical validation studies currently. While the detection of ctDNA has promising standardized liquid biopsy kits from various companies with large clinical trials ongoing, their applications in screening and minimal residual disease can suffer from lower sensitivity. However, researchers are working towards solutions to these issues with innovations in technology, multi-omics, and sampling. With great promise, further research is needed before liquid biopsies can be recommended for everyday clinical management."

To date, most male breast cancers (MBCs) are treated according to protocols established for female breast cancer (FBC). Thus, defining the transcriptional and epigenetic landscape of MBC with improved resolution is critical for developing better avenues for therapeutic intervention. In this study, we present matched transcriptional (scRNA-seq) and epigenetic (scATAC-seq) profiles at single-cell resolution of two treatment naïve MBC tumors processed immediately after surgical resection. These data enable the detection of differentially expressed genes between male and female breast tumors across immune, stromal, and malignant cell types, to highlight several genes that may have therapeutic implications. Notably,MYCtarget genes andmTORC1signaling genes were significantly upregulated in the malignant cells of MBC compared to the female counterparts. To understand how the regulatory landscape of MBC gives rise to these male-specific gene expression patterns, we leveraged the scATAC-seq data to systematically link changes in chromatin accessibility to changes in gene expression within each cell type. We observed cancer-specific rewiring of several salient enhancers and posit that these enhancers have a higher regulatory load than lineage-specific enhancers. We highlight two examples of previously unannotated cancer-cell-specific enhancers ofANXA2andPRDX4gene expression and show evidence for super-enhancer regulation ofLAMB3andCD47in male breast cancer cells. Overall, this dataset annotates clinically relevant regulatory networks in male breast tumors, providing a useful resource that expands our current understanding of the gene expression programs that underlie the biology of MBC."

Their mechanistic interpretation is relatively limited and can use the help from computational prediction of their effects on epigenetic profiles. However, current models often focus on local, 1D genome sequence determinants and disregard global, 3D chromatin structure that critically affects epigenetic events.We find that noncoding variants of unexpected high similarity in epigenetic profiles, with regards to their relatively low similarity in local sequences, can be largely attributed to their proximity in chromatin structure. Accordingly, we have developed a multimodal deep learning scheme that incorporates both data of 1D genome sequence and 3D chromatin structure for predicting noncoding variant effects. Specifically, we have integrated convolutional and recurrent neural networks for sequence embedding and graph neural networks for structure embedding despite the resolution gap between the two types of data, while utilizing recent DNA language models. Numerical results show that our models outperform competing sequence-only models in predicting epigenetic profiles and their use of long-range interactions complement sequence-only models in extracting regulatory motifs. They prove to be excellent predictors for noncoding variant effects in gene expression and pathogenicity, whether in unsupervised ""zero-shot"" learning or supervised ""few-shot"" learning.Codes and data can be accessed at https://github.com/Shen-Lab/ncVarPred-1D3D and https://zenodo.org/record/7975777.© The Author(s) 2023.

We measured DNA-methylation levels using bisulfite pyrosequencing and estimated incidence rate ratios (IRR) using Cox proportional hazards models with adjustment for baseline age, sex, educational level, smoking status, body mass index, alcohol intake, physical activity, and diet score. Global DNA-methylation levels were assessed by long interspersed nucleotide element 1 (LINE-1) analysis. Overall, the IRR forAHRRhypomethylation (lowest vs. other quartiles) was 2.52 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.24-5.15]. When stratified according to time between blood draw and diagnosis, lowAHRRmethylation levels were associated with a future diagnosis of NHL [IRR: 4.50 (95% CI, 1.62-12.50) at 0-<5 years, 7.04 (95% CI, 2.36-21.02) at 5-<10 years, and 0.56 (95% CI, 0.21-1.45) at ≥10 years]. There was no association between global DNA-methylation levels and risk of NHL. Our results show thatAHRRhypomethylation in blood leukocytes is associated with a higher risk of NHL in a time-dependent manner, suggesting that it occurs as a response to tumor development.Our population-based study demonstrated that lowerAHRRmethylation levels in peripheral blood leukocytes were associated with an increased risk of NHL. This association was independent of tobacco smoking, sex, and lifestyle characteristics, but was highly dependent on time to diagnosis.

However, the immediate impact of maltreatment on brain development in children and the extent to which altered global brain volume contributes to intellectual development in children with maltreatment experience is currently unknown. We here utilized MRI data obtained from children within 6 months after the exposure to maltreatment to assess the association of maltreatment severity with global brain volume changes. We further assessed the association between maltreatment severity and intellectual development and tested for the mediating effect of brain volume on this association.We used structural MRI (3T) in a sample of 49 children aged 3-5 years with maltreatment exposure, i.e. emotional and physical abuse and/or neglect within 6 months, to characterize intracranial and tissue-specific volumes. Maltreatment severity was coded using the Maternal Interview for the Classification of Maltreatment. IQ was tested at study entry and after one year using the Snijders Oomen Nonverbal Test.Higher maltreatment severity was significantly correlated with smaller intracranial volume (r = -.393,p = .008), which was mainly driven by lower total brain volume (r = -.393,p = .008), which in turn was primarily due to smaller gray matter volume (r = -.454,p = .002). Furthermore, smaller gray matter volume was associated with lower IQ at study entry (r = -.548,p < .001) and predicted IQ one year later (r = -.493,p = .004.). The observed associations were independent of potential confounding variables, including height, socioeconomic status, age and sex.We provide evidence that greater maltreatment severity in early childhood is related to smaller brain size at a very young age with significant consequences for intellectual ability, likely setting a path for far-reaching long-term disadvantages. Insights into the molecular and neural processes that underlie the impact of maltreatment on brain structure and function are urgently needed to derive mechanism-driven targets for early intervention.© 2023 The Authors."

This study approaches research with Alaska Native people using a community-engaged approach designed to create mutually-beneficial partnerships, including intentional relationship development, capacity building, and sample and data care.A total of 117 Alaska Native individuals from two regions of Alaska joined the research study. Participants completed surveys on cultural identification, historical trauma (historical loss scale and historical loss associated symptoms scale), and general wellbeing. Participants provided a blood sample which was used to assess DNA methylation with the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC array.We report an association between historical loss associated symptoms and DNA methylation at five CpG sites, evidencing the embodiment of historical trauma. We further report an association between cultural identification and general wellbeing, complementing evidence from oral narratives and additional studies that multiple aspects of cultural connection may buffer the effects of and/or aid in the healing process from historical trauma.A community-engaged approach emphasizes balanced partnerships between communities and researchers. Here, this approach helps better understand embodiment of historical trauma in Alaska Native peoples. This analysis reveals links between the historical trauma response and DNA methylation. Indigenous communities have been stigmatized for public health issues instead caused by systemic inequalities, social disparities, and discrimination, and we argue that the social determinants of health model in Alaska Native peoples must include the vast impact of historical trauma and ongoing colonial violence.© 2023.

In our previous study,CUX1was identified as a differential expressed gene between Hu sheep lambskin with small wave patterns (SM) and straight wool patterns (ST); however, the exact molecular mechanism ofCUX1expression has been obscure. As DNA methylation can regulate the gene expression, the potential association betweenCUX1core promotor region methylation and lambskin pattern in Hu sheep was explored in the present study. The results show that the core promoter region ofCUX1was present at (-1601-(-1) bp) upstream of the transcription start site. A repressive region (-1151-(-751) bp) was also detected, which had a strong inhibitory effect onCUX1promoter activity. Bisulfite amplicon sequencing revealed that no significant difference was detected between the methylation levels ofCUX1core promoter region in SM tissues and ST tissues. Although the data demonstrated the differential expression ofCUX1between SM and ST probably has no association with DNA methylation, the identification of the core region and a potential repressive region ofCUX1promoter can enrich the role ofCUX1in Hu sheep hair follicle development."

One such possible mechanism, DNA methylation, is a process of epigenetic regulation that changes gene expression via chemical modification of nitrogenous bases. DNA methylation has been implicated in the pathophysiology of several psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia (SZ) and major depressive disorder (MDD). In this review, we propose alterations to DNA methylation as a converging model for the therapeutic effects of psychedelic compounds, highlighting the N-methyl D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), a crucial mediator of synaptic plasticity with known dysfunction in both diseases, as an example and anchoring point.

Although numerous LOAD-associated loci have been discovered, the causal variants and their target genes remain largely unknown. Since the brain is composed of heterogenous cell subtypes, it is imperative to study the brain on a cell subtype specific level to explore the biological processes underlying LOAD.Here, we present the largest parallel single-nucleus (sn) multi-omics study to simultaneously profile gene expression (snRNA-seq) and chromatin accessibility (snATAC-seq) to date, using nuclei from 12 normal and 12 LOAD brains. We identified cell subtype clusters based on gene expression and chromatin accessibility profiles and characterized cell subtype-specific LOAD-associated differentially expressed genes (DEGs), differentially accessible peaks (DAPs) and cis co-accessibility networks (CCANs).Integrative analysis defined disease-relevant CCANs in multiple cell subtypes and discovered LOAD-associated cell subtype-specific candidate cis regulatory elements (cCREs), their candidate target genes, and trans-interacting transcription factors (TFs), some of which, including ELK1, JUN, and SMAD4 in excitatory neurons, were also LOAD-DEGs. Finally, we focused on a subset of cell subtype-specific CCANs that overlap known LOAD-GWAS regions and catalogued putative functional SNPs changing the affinities of TF motifs within LOAD-cCREs linked to LOAD-DEGs, including APOE and MYO1E in a specific subtype of microglia and BIN1 in a subpopulation of oligodendrocytes.To our knowledge, this study represents the most comprehensive systematic interrogation to date of regulatory networks and the impact of genetic variants on gene dysregulation in LOAD at a cell subtype resolution. Our findings reveal crosstalk between epigenetic, genomic, and transcriptomic determinants of LOAD pathogenesis and define catalogues of candidate genes, cCREs, and variants involved in LOAD genetic etiology and the cell subtypes in which they act to exert their pathogenic effects. Overall, these results suggest that cell subtype-specific cis-trans interactions between regulatory elements and TFs, and the genes dysregulated by these networks contribute to the development of LOAD.© 2023.

Moreover, GC patients with high NT5DC2 expression exhibited shorter overall survival and post progression survival, and the NT5DC2 was metastatic GC patients' independent prognostic factor. Totally 29 pathways were activated in metastatic GC samples with high NT5DC2 expression. Four immune cells' infiltration were significantly different between NT5DC2 high and low expressed metastatic GC patients. NT5DC2 showed significantly negative correlations with 6 types of immune cells' critical marker genes and 5 types of immune cell infiltration.

Research on the genetics, epigenetics, and brain function of BPD is lacking. MicroRNA-124-3p (miR-124-3p) was recently identified in a Genome-Wide Association Study as likely associated with BPD. Here, we identified the anatomical brain expression of genes likely modulated by miR-124-3p and compared morphometry in those brain regions in BPD inpatients vs. controls matched for psychiatric comorbidities. We isolated lists of targets likely modulated by miR-124-3p from TargetScan (v 8.0) by their preferentially conserved targeting (Aggregate PCT> 0.99, see Supplementary Table 1). We applied Process Genes List (PGL) to identify regions of interest associated with the co-expression of miR-124-3p target genes. We compared the gray matter volume of the top region of interest co-expressing those genes between BPD inpatients (n= 111, 46% female) and psychiatric controls (n= 111, 54% female) at The Menninger Clinic in Houston, Texas. We then correlated personality measures, suicidal ideation intensity, and recovery from suicidal ideation with volumetrics. Gene targets of miR-124-3p were significantly co-expressed in the left Globus Pallidus (GP), which was smaller in BPD than in psychiatric controls. Smaller GP volume was negatively correlated with agreeableness and with recovery from suicidal ideation post-treatment. In BPD, GP volume may be reduced through miR-124-3p regulation and suppression of its target genes. Importantly, we identified that a reduction of the GP in BPD could serve as a potential biomarker for recovery from suicidal ideation."

This comprehensive review paper delves into the impact of the exposome, which encompasses the totality of environmental exposures, on unhealthy aging. It explores how environmental factors contribute to the acceleration of aging processes, increase biological age, and facilitate the development and progression of a wide range of age-associated diseases. The impact of environmental factors on cognitive health and the development of chronic age-related diseases affecting the cardiovascular system and central nervous system is discussed, with a specific focus on Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke, small vessel disease, and vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). Aging is a major risk factor for these diseases. Their pathogenesis involves cellular and molecular mechanisms of aging such as increased oxidative stress, impaired mitochondrial function, DNA damage, and inflammation and is influenced by environmental factors. Environmental toxicants, including ambient particulate matter, pesticides, heavy metals, and organic solvents, have been identified as significant contributors to cardiovascular and brain aging disorders. These toxicants can inflict both macro- and microvascular damage and many of them can also cross the blood-brain barrier, inducing neurotoxic effects, neuroinflammation, and neuronal dysfunction. In conclusion, environmental factors play a critical role in modulating cardiovascular and brain aging. A deeper understanding of how environmental toxicants exacerbate aging processes and contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, VCI, and dementia is crucial for the development of preventive strategies and interventions to promote cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and brain health. By mitigating exposure to harmful environmental factors and promoting healthy aging, we can strive to reduce the burden of age-related cardiovascular and brain pathologies in the aging population.© 2023.

The objective of this paper is to use permutation-based inference and a new ranked-based test statistic to identify sex-based epigenetic differences in the human DNA methylome. In particular, we examine whether we could identify separations between the female and male distributions of DNA methylation across hundred of thousands CpG sites in two independent cohorts, the Swedish Adoption Twin study and the Lamarck study. Based on Fisherian p-values, we set a threshold for methylation differences ""worth further scrutiny"". At this threshold, we were able to confirm previously-found CpG sites that stratify with respect to sex. These CpG sites with sex differences in DNA methylation should be further investigated for their possible contribution to various physiological and pathological functions in the human body. We followed-up our statistical analyses with a literature review in order to inform the proposed disease implications for the loci we uncovered.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."

The kidneys are deemed susceptible to such a process, although the exact mechanisms remain elusive. Many factors have been reported to contribute to the developmental origin of chronic kidney diseases (CKD), among which peri-gestational nutrition has a central role, affecting kidney development and metabolism. Physiologically, the link between malnutrition, reduced glomerular numbers, and increased blood pressure is key in the developmental programming of CKD. However, recent studies regarding oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, epigenetic modifications, and metabolic changes have revealed potential novel pathways for therapeutic intervention. This review will discuss the role of imbalanced nutrition in the development of CKD."

Fetal neurosonography scans were performed in the third trimester, and according to body mass index (BMI) values, the patients were evaluated in two groups: obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) and normal weight (BMI < 30 kg/m2). During neurosonography, fetal insular depth and Sylvian fissures, parieo-occipital and cingulate fissure depth, frontal lobe length, and the sizes of the corpus callosum and cavum septum pellucidum were measured using a transvaginal approach. Fetal cortical development and Sylvian fissure operculization were graded.The number of patients with grade 2 fetal cortical development was significantly higher among the pregnant women in the obese group compared to the normal weight group (n = 17, 41.5% and n = 8, 16.0%, respectively; p = 0.007). In the obese group, the number of pregnant women with grade 4 or below fetal Sylvian fissure operculization was significantly higher (n = 13, 31.7%), and the number of those with grade 9 or above operculization was significantly lower (n = 1, 2.5%) (p = 0.003). The fetal insular depth, frontal lobe anterior-posterior diameter, cingulate fissure depth, and corpus callosum thickness were lower in the obese group, albeit with no significant difference. Parieto-occipital depth significantly decreased in the obese group [6.8 (6) mm)] compared to the control group [10.5 (7.2) mm)] (p = 0.008). The fetal Sylvian fissure ratio and the cavum septum pellucidum ratio were found to be similar between the groups.The data obtained from this study showed that obesity caused fetal cortical changes in pregnant women.© 2023.

To assess the relationship between obesity-relatedH19DMRmethylation andH19andIGF2gene expression and offspring growth and body composition.Thirty-nine overweight/obese and 25 normal weight pregnant women were selected from the ""Araraquara Cohort Study"" according to their pre-pregnancy BMI. Fetal growth and body composition and newborn growth were assessed, respectively, by ultrasound and anthropometry. The methylation ofH19DMRin maternal blood, cord blood, maternal decidua and placental villi tissues was evaluated by methylation-sensitive restriction endonuclease qPCR, andH19andIGF2expression by relative real-time PCR quantification. Multiple linear regression models explored the associations of DNA methylation and gene expression with maternal, fetal, and newborn parameters.H19DMRwas less methylated in maternal blood of the overweight/obese group. There were associations ofH19DMRmethylation in cord blood with centiles of fetal biparietal diameter (BPD) and abdominal subcutaneous fat thickness and newborn head circumference (HC);H19DMRmethylation in maternal decidua with fetal occipitofrontal diameter (OFD), HC, and length;H19DMRmethylation in placental villi with fetal OFD, HC and abdominal subcutaneous fat thickness and with newborn HC.H19expression in maternal decidua was associated with fetal BPD and femur length centiles and in placental villi with fetal OFD and subcutaneous arm fat.IGF2expression in maternal decidua was associated with fetal BPD and in placental villi with fetal OFD.To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate associations of imprinted genes variations at the maternal-fetal interface of the placenta and in cord blood with fetal body composition, supporting the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in offspring growth and body composition.Copyright © 2023 Argentato, Marchesi, Dejani, Nakandakare, Teles, Batista, Leitão, Luzia, Ramos and Rondó."

Here, we analysed cervical and breast DNA methylation (n = 1848) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (n = 1442) and demonstrate that a linear combination of methylation levels at 104 BC-associated methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) CpGs, termed the WID™-qtBC index, can identify women with breast cancer in hormone-sensitive tissues (AUC = 0.71 [95% CI: 0.65-0.77] in cervical samples). Women in the highest combined risk group (high polygenic risk score and WID™-qtBC) had a 9.6-fold increased risk for BC [95% CI: 4.7-21] compared to the low-risk group and tended to present at more advanced stages. Importantly, the WID™-qtBC is influenced by non-genetic BC risk factors, including age and body mass index, and can be modified by a preventive pharmacological intervention, indicating an interaction between genome and environment recorded at the level of the epigenome. Our findings indicate that methylation levels at mQTLs in relevant surrogate tissues could enable integration of heritable and non-heritable factors for improved disease risk stratification.© 2023.

"530",37900096,"Aging, longevity, and the role of environmental stressors: a focus on wildfire smoke and air quality.","Front Toxicol","Aging is a complex biological process involving multiple interacting mechanisms and is being increasingly linked to environmental exposures such as wildfire smoke. In this review, we detail the hallmarks of aging, emphasizing the role of telomere attrition, cellular senescence, epigenetic alterations, proteostasis, genomic instability, and mitochondrial dysfunction, while also exploring integrative hallmarks - altered intercellular communication and stem cell exhaustion. Within each hallmark of aging, our review explores how environmental disasters like wildfires, and their resultant inhaled toxicants, interact with these aging mechanisms. The intersection between aging and environmental exposures, especially high-concentration insults from wildfires, remains under-studied. Preliminary evidence, from our group and others, suggests that inhaled wildfire smoke can accelerate markers of neurological aging and reduce learning capabilities. This is likely mediated by the augmentation of circulatory factors that compromise vascular and blood-brain barrier integrity, induce chronic neuroinflammation, and promote age-associated proteinopathy-related outcomes. Moreover, wildfire smoke may induce a reduced metabolic, senescent cellular phenotype. Future interventions could potentially leverage combined anti-inflammatory and NAD + boosting compounds to counter these effects. This review underscores the critical need to study the intricate interplay between environmental factors and the biological mechanisms of aging to pave the way for effective interventions.Copyright © 2023 Scieszka, Bolt, McCormick, Brigman and Campen."

The association between air pollutant exposure and hypertension has been found to be potentiated by obesity, however, little is known about the processes mediating this association. This study investigated the association between fine particulate matter (aerodynamic equivalent diameter ≤ 2.5 microns, PM2.5) exposure and the prevalence of hypertension in a representative population in southern China and tested whether obesity mediated this association.A total of 14,308 adults from 48 communities/villages in southern China were selected from January 2015 to December 2015 using a stratified multistage random sampling method. Hourly PM2.5 measurements were collected from the China National Environmental Monitoring Centre. Restricted cubic splines were used to analyze the nonlinear dose-response relationship between PM2.5 exposure and hypertension risk. The mediating effect mechanism of obesity on PM2.5-associated hypertension was tested in a causal inference framework following the approach proposed by Imai and Keele.A total of 20.7% (2966/14,308) of participants in the present study were diagnosed with hypertension. Nonlinear exposure-response analysis revealed that exposure to an annual mean PM2.5 concentration above 41.8 µg/m3was associated with increased hypertension risk at an incremental gradient. 9.1% of the hypertension burden could be attributed to exposure to elevated annual average concentrations of PM2.5. It is noteworthy that an increased body fat percentage positively mediated 59.3% of the association between PM2.5 exposure and hypertension risk, whereas body mass index mediated 34.3% of this association.This study suggests that a significant portion of the estimated effect of exposure to PM2.5 on the risk of hypertension appears to be attributed to its effect on alterations in body composition and the development of obesity. These findings could inform intersectoral actions in future studies to protect populations with excessive fine particle exposure from developing hypertension.© 2023.

Mendelian randomization (MR) method was used to investigate the causality between SS and different types of cancers.We conducted the two-sample Mendelian randomization with the public genome-wide association studies (GWASs) summary statistics in European population to evaluate the causality between SS and nine types of cancers. The sample size varies from 1080 to 372,373. The inverse variance weighted (IVW) method was used to estimate the causal effects. A Bonferroni-corrected threshold of P < 0.0031 was considered significant, and P value between 0.0031 and 0.05 was considered to be suggestive of an association. Sensitivity analysis was performed to validate the causality. Moreover, additional analysis was used to assess the associations between SS and well-accepted risk factors of cancers.After correcting the heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy, the results indicated that patients with SS were significantly associated with an increased risk of lymphomas (odds ratio [OR] = 1.0010, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.0005-1.0015, P = 0.0002) and reduced risks of prostate cancer (OR = 0.9972, 95% CI: 0.9960-0.9985, P = 2.45 × 10-5) and endometrial cancer (OR = 0.9414, 95% CI: 0.9158-0.9676, P = 1.65 × 10-5).

CIBERSORT and gene set variation analyses were used to evaluate the relative immune cell infiltration and enriched molecular pathways of the samples, respectively. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was used to identify the co-expression modules and hub genes. Finally, univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate differences in clinical and laboratory characteristics between the different groups. The role of IFN-1 gene signatures in SLE was comprehensively assessed, which revealed an IFN-1 gene signature including six genes that could easily distinguish SLE patients and healthy individuals and identified two distinct IFN-1 subtypes exhibiting significant differences in clinical characteristics, immune microenvironment, and biological functional pathways. The SLE disease activity index, lower lymphocyte count, nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor signaling pathway, and dendritic cell activation were strongly correlated with the IFN-1 gene signatures. In addition, we found that IFN-1 gene signatures in SLE may be an important susceptibility factor for SS, and the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway was identified as a common pathway. This study provides a comprehensive evaluation of the IFN-1 gene signatures, which may provide a new direction for the understanding of SLE and SS and help in the selection of optimal strategies for personalized immunotherapy.© 2023.

However, its specific role in gastric cancer was not explicitly illustrated. In this context, we aimed to investigate the biological role and mechanisms about KLHL5 in gastric cancer. qRT-PCR and western blot were used to investigate the expression of KLHL5 and EMT biomarkers. Wound healing assay, CCK-8, and Transwell assay were used to investigate the biological function of KLHL5. We found that KLHL5 was highly expressed in gastric cancer both in vivo and in vitro; besides, its high expression led to a shorter overall survival. Following statistical analysis showed that KLHL5 was associated with M stage. As for molecular experiments, we found that KLHL5 knockdown significantly reduced the proliferation, migration, and invasion ability of gastric cancer cell line MKN45 and SGC-7901. Furthermore, we found that miR-181-5p targeted KLHL5 to regulate m6A level through METTL3. In addition, KLHL5 knockdown could significantly reduce the lung metastasis rate in mice.

One of the most significant properties of cancer cells to prevent the immune system response and resist chemotherapy is the altered lipid metabolism and resulting irregular cell membrane composition. The phospholipid distribution in the plasma membrane of normal animal cells is distinctly asymmetric. Lipid flippases are a family of enzymes regulating membrane asymmetry, and the main class of flippases are type IV P-type ATPases (P4-ATPases). Alteration in the function of flippases results in changes to membrane organization. For some lipids, such as phosphatidylserine, the changes are so drastic that they are considered cancer biomarkers.

Fifty-seven samples in total, thirty-eight from PLWH and nineteen from non-PLWH participants with or without MAFLD, were obtained and subjected to DNA extraction from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Global DNA methylation and telomere length quantification were performed using an adapted enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and qPCR, respectively. The quantification results were analysed and corrected by clinically relevant variables in this context, such as age, sex, and metabolic syndrome. Our results show an increased association of these biomarkers in PLWH regardless of their MAFLD status.

Therefore, developing efficient and interpretable methods to quantify network changes and pinpoint driver genes across conditions is crucial. We propose a hierarchical graph representation learning method, called iHerd. Given a set of networks, iHerd first hierarchically generates a series of coarsened sub-graphs in a data-driven manner, representing network modules at different resolutions (e.g., the level of signaling pathways). Then, it sequentially learns low-dimensional node representations at all hierarchical levels via efficient graph embedding. Lastly, iHerd projects separate gene embeddings onto the same latent space in its graph alignment module to calculate a rewiring index for driver gene prioritization. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we applied iHerd on a tumor-to-normal GRN rewiring analysis and cell-type-specific GCN analysis using single-cell multiome data of the brain. We showed that iHerd can effectively pinpoint novel and well-known risk genes in different diseases. Distinct from existing models, iHerd's graph coarsening for hierarchical learning allows us to successfully classify network driver genes into early and late divergent genes (EDGs and LDGs), emphasizing genes with extensive network changes across and within signaling pathway levels. This unique approach for driver gene classification can provide us with deeper molecular insights. The code is freely available at https://github.com/aicb-ZhangLabs/iHerd.

In this retrospective study, we investigated the prevalence ofBRCA1promoter methylation in 84 human breast tissues, and we correlated this epigenetic silencing with the clinical and histopathological parameters of breast cancer. We used methylation-specific PCR (MSP) to analyze BRCA1 promoter hypermethylation in 48 malignant breast tumors (MBTs), 15 normal adjacent tissues (NATs), and 21 benign breast lesions (BBLs). The results showed thatBRCA1promoter hypermethylation was higher in MBTs (20/48; 41.67%) and NATs (7/15; 46.67%) compared to BBLs (4/21; 19.05%). The high percentage of BRCA1 hypermethylation in the histologically normal adjacent tissues to the tumors (NATs) suggests the involvement of this epigenetic silencing as a potential biomarker of the early genomic instability in NATs surrounding the tumors. The detection of BRCA1 promoter hypermethylation in BBLs reinforces this suggestion, knowing that a non-negligible rate of benign breast lesions was reported to evolve into cancer. Moreover, our results indicated that theBRCA1promoter hypermethylated group of MBTs exhibited higher rates of aggressive features, as indicated by the SBR III grade (14/19; 73.68%), elevated Ki67 levels (13/16; 81.25%), and Her2 receptor overexpression (5/20; 25%). Finally, we observed a concordance (60%) inBRCA1promoter hypermethylation status between malignant breast tumors and their paired histologically normal adjacent tissues. This study highlights the role of BRCA1 promoter hypermethylation as a potential useful biomarker of aggressiveness in MBTs and as an early marker of genomic instability in both histological NATs and BBLs."

A total of 163 529 children born in Sweden between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 1997, were followed up until their 21st birthday. They were linked to registries using Sweden's national personal identification number. Children were linked to birth parents, hospital records, and school data. Parents were linked to registries containing health, income, sociodemographic, and obstetric data. Analyses were conducted between January 10, 2021, and August 26, 2022.Childhood adversities of relative poverty (household disposable income <50% of the median), parental inpatient admission for a mental illness, or parental separation. Adversities were categorized into developmental periods: ages 0 to 3, 4 to 7, 8 to 11, and 12 to 16 years.The main outcomes were children's hospital records with a diagnosis of anxiety or depression between ages 16 and 21 years and school grades at the end of compulsory education (age 16 years). The parametric g-formula modeled population changes in outcomes associated with the counterfactual, hypothetical preventing adversity exposures, accounting for fixed and time-varying confounders. Adjustments were made for parental demographic characteristics, obstetric variables, and socioeconomic data at birth.A total of 163 529 children were included in the cohort (51.2% boys, 51.4% born in 1996). Preventing all adversities was associated with an estimated change in the prevalence of offspring common mental disorders from 10.2% to 7.6% and an improvement in school grades with an SD of 0.149 (95% CI, 0.147-0.149). Preventing parental separation provided for the greatest improvement, with an estimated 2.34% (95% CI, 2.23%-2.42%) fewer children with a common mental disorder and an improvement in school grades by 0.127 SDs (0.125-0.129). Greater improvements were shown by hypothetically targeting adolescents (age 12-16 years) and those whose parents had a mental illness when the child was born.The results of this cohort modeling study suggest that preventing childhood adversity could provide notable improvements in the rates of common mental disorders and school grades. Many children might achieve better life outcomes if resources are properly allocated to the right adversities (parental separation), the right groups (children with parental mental illness), and at the right time (adolescence)."

In the Generation R Study (n = 1644, Rotterdam, The Netherlands), mothers reported depressive symptoms using the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) during pregnancy, and child hair cortisol was measured at a mean (SD) age of 6.0 (0.5) years. We used cutoffs of ≥ 13 for the EPDS and > 0.75 for the BSI to indicate high levels of prenatal depressive symptoms. We used multivariable linear regression models adjusted for child sex and age (at outcome), and maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, education, social support from friends/family, pregnancy smoking status, marital status, and household income to assess associations separately in each cohort. We also meta-analyzed childhood hair cortisol results from both cohorts.8.0% and 5.1% of women respectively experienced high levels of prenatal depressive symptoms in Project Viva and the Generation R Study. We found no associations between high levels of maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy and child cortisol biomarkers in either cohort.The present study does not find support for the direct link between high levels of maternal depressive symptoms and offspring cortisol levels.© 2023.

Trichostatin A (TSA) has been revealed to show protective effect on central nervous systems in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. However, the effect and molecular mechanism of TSA on cognitive function of DE are unknown. Here, we demonstrated that cognitive function was damaged in diabetic mice versus normal mice and treatment with TSA improved cognitive function in diabetic mice. Proteomic analysis of the hippocampus revealed 174 differentially expressed proteins in diabetic mice compared with normal mice. TSA treatment reversed the expression levels of 111 differentially expressed proteins grouped into functional clusters, including the longevity regulating pathway, the insulin signaling pathway, peroxisomes, protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, and ribosomes. Furthermore, protein-protein interaction network analysis of TSA-reversed proteins revealed that UBA52, CAT, RPL29, RPL35A, CANX, RPL37, and PRKAA2 were the main hub proteins. Multiple KEGG pathway-enriched CAT and PRKAA2 levels were significantly decreased in the hippocampus of diabetic mice versus normal mice, which was reversed by TSA administration. Finally, screening for potential similar or ancillary drugs for TSA treatment indicated that HDAC inhibitors ISOX, apicidin, and panobinostat were the most promising similar drugs, and the PI3K inhibitor GSK-1059615, the Aurora kinase inhibitor alisertib, and the nucleophosmin inhibitor avrainvillamide-analog-6 were the most promising ancillary drugs. In conclusion, our study revealed that CAT and PRKAA2 were the key proteins involved in the improvement of DE after TSA treatment. ISOX, apicidin, and panobinostat were promising similar drugs and that GSK-1059615, alisertib, and avrainvillamide-analog-6 were promising ancillary drugs to TSA in the treatment of DE.© 2023.

"547",37872843,"A scalable and tunable platform for functional interrogation of peptide hormones in fish.","Elife","Pituitary hormones play a central role in shaping vertebrate life history events, including growth, reproduction, metabolism, and aging. The regulation of these traits often requires precise control of hormone levels across diverse timescales. However, fine tuning circulating hormones in-vivo has traditionally been experimentally challenging. Here, using the naturally short-lived turquoise killifish (N. furzeri), we describe a high-throughput platform that combines loss- and gain-of-function of peptide hormones. Mutation of three primary pituitary hormones, growth hormone (gh1), follicle stimulating hormone (fshb), and thyroid stimulating hormone (tshb), alters somatic growth and reproduction. Thus, suggesting that while the killifish undergoes extremely rapid growth and maturity, it still relies on vertebrate-conserved genetic networks. As the next stage, we developed a gain-of-function vector system in which a hormone is tagged using a self-cleavable fluorescent reporter, and ectopically expressed in-vivo through intramuscular electroporation. Following a single electroporation, phenotypes, such as reproduction, are stably rescued for several months. Notably, we demonstrate the versatility of this approach by using multiplexing, dose-dependent, and doxycycline-inducible systems to achieve tunable and reversible expression. In summary, this method is relatively high-throughput, and facilitates large-scale interrogation of life-history strategies in fish. Ultimately, this approach could be adapted for modifying aquaculture species and exploring pro-longevity interventions.© 2023, Moses et al."

We provide basic quality control steps and demonstrate the utility of our dataset by performing differential gene expression and gene ontology analyses by age and sex. Importantly, we show that age has a greater impact than sex on transcriptional landscapes across probed tissues. Finally, we confirm transcription of transposable elements (TEs), which are highly abundant and increase in expression with age in brain tissue.

TADs are formed by Cohesin-mediated loop extrusion, with many TAD boundaries consisting of clustered binding sites of the CTCF insulator protein. Here we determine how this clustering of CTCF binding contributes to the blocking of loop extrusion and the insulation between TADs. We identify enrichment of three features of CTCF binding at strong TAD boundaries, consisting of strongly bound and closely spaced CTCF binding peaks, with a further enrichment of DNA-binding motifs within these peaks. Using multi-contact Nano-C analysis in cells with normal and perturbed CTCF binding, we establish that individual CTCF binding sites contribute to the blocking of loop extrusion, but in an incomplete manner. When clustered, individual CTCF binding sites thus create a stepwise insulation between neighboring TADs. Based on these results, we propose a model whereby multiple instances of temporal loop extrusion blocking create strong insulation between TADs.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."

Inflammation plays an important role in endothelial dysfunction regulated by epigenetic modifications. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is one of the most prevalent epigenetic modifications in eukaryotic cells. In this research, we identified an m6A demethylase, fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO), as an essential epitranscriptomic regulator in diabetes-induced vascular endothelial dysfunction. We showed that enhanced FTO reduced the global level of m6A in hyperglycemia. FTO knockdown in endothelial cells (ECs) resulted in less inflammation and compromised ability of migration and tube formation. Compared with EC Ftofl/fl diabetic mice, EC-specific Fto-deficient (EC FtoΔ/Δ) diabetic mice displayed less retinal vascular leakage and acellular capillary formation. Furthermore, methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-Seq) combined with RNA-Seq indicated that Tnip1 served as a downstream target of FTO. Luciferase activity assays and RNA pull-down demonstrated that FTO repressed TNIP1 mRNA expression by erasing its m6A methylation. In addition, TNIP1 depletion activated NF-κB and other inflammatory factors, which aggravated retinal vascular leakage and acellular capillary formation, while sustained expression of Tnip1 by intravitreal injection of adeno-associated virus alleviated endothelial impairments. These findings suggest that the FTO-TNIP1-NF-κB network provides potential targets to treat diabetic vascular complications."

The efficacy of drugs such as metformin and sulfonylureas can be enhanced by the activity of the intestinal microbiome elaborated metabolites. Functional foods such as prebiotics (e.g., oligofructose) and dietary fibers can treat a dysbiotic gut microbiome by enhancing the diversity of microbial niches in the gut. These beneficial shifts in intestinal microbiome profiles include an increased abundance of bacteria such asFaecalibacterium prauznitzii,Akkermancia muciniphila,Roseburia species, andBifidobacteriumspecies. An important net effect is an increase in the levels of luminal SCFAs (e.g., butyrate) that provide energy carbon sources for the intestinal microbiome in cross-feeding activities, with concomitant improvement in intestinal dysbiosis with attenuation of inflammatory sequalae and improved intestinal gut barrier integrity, which alleviates the morbidity of T2DM. Oligosaccharides administered adjunctively with pharmacotherapy to ameliorate T2DM represent current plausible treatment modalities."

Herein, we report that a transfer RNA-derived RNA fragment, tRF-3001a, is significantly upregulated under diabetic conditions. tRF-3001a downregulation inhibits Müller cell activation, suppresses endothelial angiogenic effects, and protects against high-glucose-induced retinal ganglion cell injury in vitro. Furthermore, tRF-3001a downregulation alleviates retinal vascular dysfunction, inhibits retinal reactive gliosis, facilitates retinal ganglion cell survival, and preserves visual function and visually guided behaviors in STZ-induced diabetic mice and db/db diabetic mice. Mechanistically, tRF-3001a regulates neurovascular dysfunction in a microRNA-like mechanism by targeting GSK3B. Clinically, tRF-3001a is upregulated in aqueous humor (AH) samples of DR patients. tRF-3001a downregulation inhibits DR-induced human retinal vascular endothelial cell and Müller cell dysfunction in vitro and DR-induced retinal neurovascular dysfunction in C57BL/6J mice. Thus, targeting tRF-3001a-mediated signaling is a promising strategy for the concurrent treatment of vasculopathy and neuropathy in diabetes mellitus.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

Targeted/personalized therapeutics are at the forefront of space medicine strategies, and cross-species molecular signatures now define the 'typical' spaceflight response. However, a lack of direct genotype-phenotype associations currently limits the robustness and, therefore, the therapeutic utility of putative mechanisms underpinning pathological changes in flight.Methods:We employed the wormCaenorhabditis elegansas a validated model of space biology, combined with 'NemaFlex-S' microfluidic devices for assessing animal strength production as one of the most reproducible physiological responses to spaceflight. Wild-type anddys-1(BZ33) strains (a Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) model for comparing predisposed muscle weak animals) were cultured on the International Space Station in chemically defined media before loading second-generation gravid adults into NemaFlex-S devices to assess individual animal strength. These same cultures were then frozen on orbit before returning to Earth for next-generation sequencing transcriptomic analysis.Results:Neuromuscular strength was lower in flightversusground controls (16.6% decline,p< 0.05), withdys-1significantly more (23% less strength,p< 0.01) affected than wild types. The transcriptional gene ontology signatures characterizing both strains of weaker animals in flight strongly corroborate previous results across species, enriched for upregulated stress response pathways and downregulated mitochondrial and cytoskeletal processes. Functional gene cluster analysis extended this to implicate decreased neuronal function, including abnormal calcium handling and acetylcholine signaling, in space-induced strength declines under the predicted control of UNC-89 and DAF-19 transcription factors. Finally, gene modules specifically altered indys-1animals in flight again cluster to neuronal/neuromuscular pathways, suggesting strength loss in DMD comprises a strong neuronal component that predisposes these animals to exacerbated strength loss in space.Conclusions:Highly reproducible gene signatures are strongly associated with space-induced neuromuscular strength loss across species and neuronal changes in calcium/acetylcholine signaling require further study. These results promote targeted medical efforts towards and provide an in vivo model for safely sending animals and people into deep space in the near future."

However, current exercise routines are not sufficient to reverse the adverse effects of microgravity exposure. Recently, salidroside (SAL), a valuable medicinal herb, has been demonstrated to display an important role for prevention and treatment in cardiovascular and other diseases. In the present work, Sprague-Dawley rats with four-week tail-suspension hindlimb-unloading were used to simulate microgravity effects on the cardiovascular system. We found that intragastrical administration of SAL not only significantly decreased the expressions of senescence biomarkers, such as P65 and P16, but also obviously increased the expressions of BK-dependent apoptotic genes, including the large-conductance calcium-activated K+channel (BK), Bax, Bcl-2, and cleaved caspase-3, in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in vivo and in vitro. In addition, relative non-coding RNAs were screened, and a luciferase assay identified that SAL increased apoptosis by activating LncRNA-FLORPAR, inhibiting miR-193, and then triggering the activity of the BK-α subunit. Our work indicated that SAL is a novel non-coding RNA modulator for regulating the LncRNA-FLORPAR sponging miR-193 pathway, which significantly promoted BK-dependent apoptosis and delayed cerebrovascular aging-like remodeling during simulated microgravity exposure.

Here we show that dry immersion rapidly induces a sedentarily-like metabolism shift mimicking the beginning of a metabolic syndrome with a drop in glucose tolerance, an increase in the atherogenic index of plasma, and an impaired lipid profile. Bone remodeling markers suggest a decreased bone formation coupled with an increased bone resorption.

In this study, we investigated the impact of simulated microgravity on the gut microbiome of 12 participants during a 60-day head-down tilt bed rest at the :envihab facilities. Over 60 days of simulated microgravity resulted in a mild change in the gut microbiome, with distinct microbial patterns and pathway expression in the feces of the countermeasure group compared to the microgravity simulation-only group. Additionally, we found that the countermeasure protocols selectively increased the abundance of beneficial short-chain fatty acids in the gut, such as acetate, butyrate, and propionate. Some physiological signatures also included the modulation of taxa reported to be either beneficial or opportunistic, indicating a mild adaptation in the microbiome network balance. Our results suggest that monitoring the gut microbial catalog along with pathway clustering and metabolite profiling is an informative synergistic strategy to determine health disturbances and the outcome of countermeasure protocols for future space missions."

Spaceflight elongates human telomeres in peripheral blood, which shorten upon return to Earth and approach baseline levels during postflight recovery. Astronauts also encounter muscle atrophy, losing up to 20% loss of muscle mass on spaceflights. Telomere length changes in muscle cells of astronauts remain unexplored. This study investigates telomere alterations in grounded mice experiencing radiation exposure and muscle atrophy, via a hindlimb unloading spaceflight mimicking model. We find telomere lengthening is present in muscle stem cells and in myofiber nuclei, but not in muscle-resident endothelial cells. We further assessed telomere length in the model following hindlimb unloading recovery. We find that telomere length failed to return to baseline values.

Therefore, pathogenesis-directed therapy is often necessary to treat severe viral infections and comorbidities associated with them. Despite significant differences in the etiopathogenesis of viral diseases, in general, they are associated with significant dysfunction of the immune system. Study of common mechanisms of immune dysfunction caused by different viral infections can help develop novel therapeutic strategies to combat infections and associated comorbidities.To identify common mechanisms of immune functions disruption during infection by nine different viruses (cytomegalovirus, Ebstein-Barr virus, human T-cell leukemia virus type 1, Hepatitis B and C viruses, human immunodeficiency virus, Dengue virus, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2), we analyzed the corresponding transcription profiles from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) using the originally developed pipeline that include transcriptome data collection, processing, normalization, analysis and search for master regulators of several viral infections. The ten datasets containing transcription data from patients infected by nine viruses and healthy people were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus. The analysis of the data was performed by Genome Enhancer pipeline.We revealed common pathways, cellular processes, and master regulators for studied viral infections. We found that all nine viral infections cause immune activation, exhaustion, cell proliferation disruption, and increased susceptibility to apoptosis. Using network analysis, we identified PBMC receptors, representing proteins at the top of signaling pathways that may be responsible for the observed transcriptional changes and maintain the current functional state of cells.The identified relationships between some of them and virus-induced alteration of immune functions are new and have not been found earlier, e.g., receptors for autocrine motility factor, insulin, prolactin, angiotensin II, and immunoglobulin epsilon.

In 2020, according to worldwide statistics, there were more than 313,000 new cases of ovarian cancer. Most concerning with ovarian cancer is the poor overall survival, with only 30% of patients surviving for longer than 5 years after diagnosis. The reason for this poor outcome includes late diagnosis due to non-specific symptoms and a lack of any highly effective biomarkers of the early stages of ovarian carcinogenesis. However, it is important to note that some modifiable lifestyle factors can be preventative [pregnancy, breastfeeding and combined oral contraceptives pill (COCP) use].There is now increasing data reporting the role of epigenetic changes, which are detectable in ovarian cancer tumors, suggesting the possibility that epigenetics may also play a key role in the mechanism of long-term effective prevention of ovarian cancer. To our knowledge, there is a lack of high-quality data on the molecular mechanisms of ovarian cancer prevention, although several hypotheses have been proposed.This review focusses on the evidence for a proposed novel hypothesis-that COCPs act as a chemoprevention through the impact on the epigenome of the cells of origin of ovarian cancer-fallopian tubes epithelium.© 2023.

Adverse outcomes include those that are observed at the time of birth, such as low birthweight, as well as those that arise later in life, such as neurological impairment. It is often the case that these adverse outcomes show sex-specific responses in relation to toxicant exposures. While the precise molecular mechanisms linking in utero toxic metal exposures with later-in-life health are unknown, placental inflammation is posited to play a critical role. Here, we sought to understand whether in utero metal exposure is associated with alterations in the expression of the placental proteome by identifying metal associated proteins (MAPs). Within the Extremely Low Gestational Age Newborns (ELGAN) cohort (n= 230), placental and umbilical cord tissue samples were collected at birth. Arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), selenium (Se), and manganese (Mn) concentrations were measured in umbilical cord tissue samples via ICP-MS/MS. Protein expression was examined in placental samples using an LC-MS/MS-based, global, untargeted proteomics analysis measuring more than 3400 proteins. MAPs were then evaluated for associations with pregnancy and neonatal outcomes, including placental weight and gestational age. We hypothesized that metal levels would be positively associated with the altered expression of inflammation/immune-associated pathways and that sex-specific patterns of metal-associated placental protein expression would be observed. Sex-specific analyses identified 89 unique MAPs expressed in female placentas and 41 unique MAPs expressed in male placentas. Notably, many of the female-associated MAPs are known to be involved in immune-related processes, while the male-associated MAPs are associated with intracellular transport and cell localization. Further, several MAPs were significantly associated with gestational age in males and females and placental weight in males. These data highlight the linkage between prenatal metal exposure and an altered placental proteome, with implications for altering the trajectory of fetal development."

By performing a genome-scale CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screen on highly recurrent region-associated enhancers in melanoma cells, we identified 66 significant hits which could have tumor-suppressive roles. These functional enhancers show unique mutational patterns independent of classical significantly mutated genes in melanoma. Target gene analysis for the essential enhancers reveal many known and hidden mechanisms underlying melanoma growth. Utilizing extensive functional validation experiments, we demonstrate that a super enhancer element could modulate melanoma cell proliferation by targeting MEF2A, and another distal enhancer is able to sustain PTEN tumor-suppressive potential via long-range interactions.Our study establishes a catalogue of crucial enhancers and their target genes in melanoma growth and progression, and illuminates the identification of novel mechanisms of dysregulation for melanoma driver genes and new therapeutic targeting strategies.© 2023.

Given the lack of clinical-grade KIF15/TPX2 inhibitors, we chose to target KIF11 (using SB-743921) in combination with AURKA (using VIC-1911) given that phosphorylation of KIF15S1169by Aurora A is required for its targeting to the spindle. In vitro, the drug combination demonstrated strong synergy (Bliss score ≥ 10) at nanomolar doses. Colony formation assay revealed significant reduction in plating efficiency (1-3%) and increased percentage accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase with the combination treatment (45-52%) upon cell cycle analysis, indicating mitotic arrest. In vivo studies in EWS xenograft mouse models showed significant tumor reduction and overall effectiveness: drug combination vs. vehicle control (p≤ 0.01), SB-743921 (p≤ 0.01) and VIC-1911 (p≤ 0.05). Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrated superior overall survival with the combination compared to vehicle or monotherapy arms (p≤ 0.0001)."

After a comprehensive evaluation on the expression patterns and immunological effects of PTPNs using a pan-cancer analysis based on RNA sequencing data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas, the most valuable gene PTPN2 was discovered. Further investigation of the expression patterns of PTPN2 in different tissues and cells showed a robust correlation with AML. PTPN2 was then systematically correlated with immunological signatures in the AML tumor microenvironment and its differential expression was verified using clinical samples. In addition, a prediction model, being validated and compared with other models, was developed in our research. The systematic analysis of PTPN family reveals that the effect of PTPNs on cancer may be correlated to mediating cell cycle-related pathways. It was then found that PTPN2 was highly expressed in hematologic diseases and bone marrow tissues, and its differential expression in AML patients and normal humans was verified by clinical samples. Based on its correlation with immune infiltrates, immunomodulators, and immune checkpoint, PTPN2 was found to be a reliable biomarker in the immunotherapy cohort and a prognostic predictor of AML. And PTPN2'riskscore can accurately predict the prognosis and response of cancer immunotherapy. These findings revealed the correlation between PTPNs and immunophenotype, which may be related to cell cycle. PTPN2 was differentially expressed between clinical AML patients and normal people. It is a diagnostic biomarker and potentially therapeutic target, providing targeted guidance for clinical treatment.© 2023. The Author(s)."

In this study, we comprehensively analyzed large-scale CRISPR, shRNA, and PRISM screens to identify potential synthetic lethal (SL) interactions in pan-cancer and 12 individual cancer types, using a new computational framework that leverages the biological function and signaling pathway information of key driver genes to mitigate the confounding effects of background genetic alterations in different cancer cell lines. This approach has successfully identified several putative SL interactions, includingKRAS-MAP3K2andAPC-TCF7L2in pan cancer, andCCND1-METTL1,TP53-FRS3,SMO-MDM2, andCCNE1-MTORin liver, blood, skin, and gastric cancers, respectively. In addition, we proposed several FDA-approved cancer-targeted drugs for various cancer types through PRISM drug screens, such as cabazitaxel forVHL-mutated kidney cancer and alectinib for lung cancer withNRASorKRASmutations. Leveraging pathway information can enhance the concordance of shRNA and CRISPR screens and provide clinically relevant findings such as the potential efficacy of dasatinib, an inhibitor ofSRC, for colorectal cancer patients with mutations in the WNT signaling pathway. These analyses revealed that taking signaling pathway information into account results in the identification of more promising SL interactions.© 2023 Karimpour et al."

Patients with neuroblastoma have a poor prognosis. The development of therapy targets and the ability to predict prognosis will be enhanced through further exploration of the genetically related genes of neuroblastoma. The present investigation utilized CRISPR-Cas9 genome-wide screening based on the DepMap database to determine essential genes for neuroblastoma cells' continued survival. WGCNA analysis was used to determine the progression-related genes, and a prognostic signature was constructed. The signature gene,NCAPG, was downregulated in neuroblastoma cells to explore its impact on various cellular processes. This research used DepMap and WGCNA to pinpoint 45 progression-related essential genes for neuroblastoma. A risk signature comprisingNCAPGandMAD2L1was established. The suppression ofNCAPGprevented neuroblastoma cells from proliferating, migrating, and invading. The results of flow cytometric analysis demonstrated thatNCAPGinhibition caused cell cycle arrest during the G2 and S phases and the activation of apoptosis. Additionally,NCAPGdownregulation activated thep53-mediated apoptotic pathway, inducing cell apoptosis. The present work showed thatNCAPGknockdown reduced neuroblastoma cell progression and may serve as a basis for further investigation into diagnostic indicators and therapy targets for neuroblastoma."
"574",37821946,NA,NA,"Genetic suppression occurs when the deleterious effects of a primary ""query"" mutation, such as a disease-causing mutation, are rescued by a suppressor mutation elsewhere in the genome.To capture existing knowledge on suppression relationships between human genes, we examined 2,400 published papers for potential interactions identified through either genetic modification of cultured human cells or through association studies in patients.The resulting network encompassed 476 unique suppression interactions covering a wide spectrum of diseases and biological functions. The interactions frequently linked genes that operate in the same biological process. Suppressors were strongly enriched for genes with a role in stress response or signaling, suggesting that deleterious mutations can often be buffered by modulating signaling cascades or immune responses. Suppressor mutations tended to be deleterious when they occurred in absence of the query mutation, in apparent contrast with their protective role in the presence of the query. We formulated and quantified mechanisms of genetic suppression that could explain 71% of interactions and provided mechanistic insight into disease pathology. Finally, we used these observations to predict suppressor genes in the human genome.The global suppression network allowed us to define principles of genetic suppression that were conserved across diseases, model systems, and species. The emerging frequency of suppression interactions among human genes and range of underlying mechanisms, together with the prevalence of suppression in model organisms, suggest that compensatory mutations may exist for most genetic diseases.© 2023.

"575",37812255,"Predicting synergistic anticancer drug combination based on low-rank global attention mechanism and bilinear predictor.","Bioinformatics","Drug combination therapy has exhibited remarkable therapeutic efficacy and has gradually become a promising clinical treatment strategy of complex diseases such as cancers. As the related databases keep expanding, computational methods based on deep learning model have become powerful tools to predict synergistic drug combinations. However, predicting effective synergistic drug combinations is still a challenge due to the high complexity of drug combinations, the lack of biological interpretability, and the large discrepancy in the response of drug combinations in vivo and in vitro biological systems.Here, we propose DGSSynADR, a new deep learning method based on global structured features of drugs and targets for predicting synergistic anticancer drug combinations. DGSSynADR constructs a heterogeneous graph by integrating the drug-drug, drug-target, protein-protein interactions and multi-omics data, utilizes a low-rank global attention (LRGA) model to perform global weighted aggregation of graph nodes and learn the global structured features of drugs and targets, and then feeds the embedded features into a bilinear predictor to predict the synergy scores of drug combinations in different cancer cell lines. Specifically, LRGA network brings better model generalization ability, and effectively reduces the complexity of graph computation. The bilinear predictor facilitates the dimension transformation of the features and fuses the feature representation of the two drugs to improve the prediction performance. The loss function Smooth L1 effectively avoids gradient explosion, contributing to better model convergence. To validate the performance of DGSSynADR, we compare it with seven competitive methods. The comparison results demonstrate that DGSSynADR achieves better performance. Meanwhile, the prediction of DGSSynADR is validated by previous findings in case studies. Furthermore, detailed ablation studies indicate that the one-hot coding drug feature, LRGA model and bilinear predictor play a key role in improving the prediction performance.DGSSynADR is implemented in Python using the Pytorch machine-learning library, and it is freely available at https://github.com/DHUDBlab/DGSSynADR.© The Author(s) 2023.

Here, we uncover that lipid metabolism reprogramming mediated by unconventional prefoldin RPB5 interactor (URI) endows HCC with resistance to TKIs-induced ferroptosis. Mechanistically, URI directly interacts with TRIM28 and promotes p53 ubiquitination and degradation in a TRIM28-MDM2 dependent manner. Importantly, p53 binds to the promoter of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) and represses its transcription. High expression of URI is correlated with high level of SCD1 and their synergetic expression predicts poor prognosis and TKIs resistance in HCC. The combination of SCD1 inhibitor aramchol and deuterated sorafenib derivative donafenib displays promising anti-tumor effects in p53-wild type HCC patient-derived organoids and xenografted tumors.

This study aimed to investigate the immunologic significance of CD80/CD86 or major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) expression in TETs, as potential predictive biomarkers for immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).We analyzed CD80, CD86, MHC class I (MHC-I), and MHC-II expression in TETs using immunohistochemistry and investigated their association with T-cell infiltration or ICI efficacy. In addition, we generated CD80- or MHC-II-expressing mouse tumors, evaluated the effects of ICIs, and analyzed tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. We also performed tumor-rechallenge experiments in vivo.We found that approximately 50% and 30% of TETs had high expression of CD80/CD86 and MHC-II in tumor cells, respectively, and that this expression was related to T-cell infiltration in clinical samples. In mouse models, both CD80 and MHC-II increase the effects of ICIs. In addition, senescent T cells and long-lived memory precursor effector T cells were significantly decreased and increased, respectively, in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes from CD80-expressing tumors, and rechallenged tumors were completely rejected after the initial eradication of CD80-expressing tumors by programmed cell death protein 1 blockade. Indeed, patients with CD80-high thymic carcinoma had longer progression-free survival with anti-programmed cell death protein 1 monoclonal antibody.Half of the TETs had high expression of CD80/CD86 or MHC-II with high T-cell infiltration. These molecules could potentially increase the effects of ICIs, particularly inducing a durable response.

Determining which of these covalent binding events affect protein function, however, remains challenging. Here we describe a base-editing strategy to infer the functionality of cysteines by quantifying the impact of their missense mutation on cancer cell proliferation. The resulting atlas, which covers more than 13,800 cysteines on more than 1,750 cancer dependency proteins, confirms the essentiality of cysteines targeted by covalent drugs and, when integrated with chemical proteomic data, identifies essential, ligandable cysteines in more than 160 cancer dependency proteins. We further show that a stereoselective and site-specific ligand targeting an essential cysteine in TOE1 inhibits the nuclease activity of this protein through an apparent allosteric mechanism.

Recently, we observed a phenotypic heterogeneity between GBM cell lines (U87MG, T98G, U251MG, DBTRG-05MG), among which the anti-GBM activity ofWWOXwas generally corresponding, but colony growth and formation were inconsistent in DBTRG-05MG. This prompted us to investigate the molecular landscapes of these cell lines, intending to translate them into the clinical context.U87MG/T98G/U251MG/DBTRG-05MG were subjected to high-throughput sequencing, and obtained data were explored via weighted gene co-expression network analysis, differential expression analysis, functional annotation, and network building. Following the identification of the most relevant DBTRG-distinguishing driver genes, data from GBM patients were employed for, e.g., differential expression analysis, survival analysis, and principal component analysis.Although most driver genes were unique for each cell line, some were inversely regulated in DBTRG-05MG. Alongside driver genes, the differentially-expressed genes were used to build a WWOX-related network depicting protein-protein interactions in U87MG/T98G/U251MG/DBTRG-05MG. This network revealed processes distinctly regulated in DBTRG-05MG, e.g., microglia proliferation or neurofibrillary tangle assembly.POLE4andHSF2BPwere selected as DBTRG-discriminating driver genes based on the gene significance, module membership, and fold-change. AlongsideWWOX,POLE4andHSF2BPexpression was used to stratify patients into cell lines-resembling groups that differed in, e.g., prognosis and treatment response. Some differences from a WWOX-related network were certified in patients, revealing genes that clarify clinical outcomes. Presumably,WWOXoverexpression in DBTRG-05MG resulted in expression profile change resembling that of patients with inferior prognosis and drug response. Among these patients, WWOX may be inaccessible for its partners and does not manifest its anti-cancer activity, which was proposed in the literature but not regarding glioblastoma or concerningPOLE4andHSF2BP.Cell lines data enabled the identification of patients among which, despite high expression ofWWOXtumor suppressor, no advantageous outcomes were noted due to the cancer-promoting profile ensured by other genes.Copyright © 2023 Kałuzińska-Kołat, Kołat, Kośla, Płuciennik and Bednarek."

Recent evidence has implicated AKR1B1 in cancer; however, the mechanisms underlying its pro-oncogenic function remain largely unknown. In this work, we report that AKR1B1 expression is controlled by the p53 tumor suppressor. We found that breast cancer patients bearing wild-typeTP53have reducedAKR1B1expression. In cancer cell lines, p53 reduced AKR1B1 mRNA and protein levels and repressed promoter activity in luciferase assays. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that p53 is recruited to the AKR1B1 promoter. We also observed that AKR1B1 overexpression promoted metastasis in the 4T1 orthotopic model of triple-negative breast cancer. Proteomic analysis of 4T1 cells overexpressing AKR1B1 showed that AKR1B1 exerts a marked effect on proteins related to metabolism, with a particular impact on mitochondrial function.

However, the underlying mechanism of GATA6 in ovarian cancer progression has not been elucidated. Data in the present study revealed that GATA6 expression was negatively correlated to microRNA-10a-5p (miR-10a-5p) in ovarian cancer tissue and cells and that GATA6 is directly targeted by miR-10a-5p. Notably, upregulated miR-10a-5p dramatically inhibited ovarian cancer cell proliferation, tumorigenic ability, migration, and invasion by targeting GATA6. In vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed that miR-10a-5p-mediated downregulation of GATA6 suppressed Akt pathway activation.

We first developed a platform to detect perturbations that cause long-term growth defects in a TPM-mutated glioblastoma cell line. However, we could not detect dependencies on either TERT itself or on an E-twenty six transcription (ETS) factor known to activate TPMs. To explore this finding, we cataloged TPM status for 441 cell lines and correlated this with genome-wide screening data. We found that TPM status was not associated with differential dependency on TERT, but that E-twenty six (ETS) transcription factors represent key dependencies in both TPM+ and TPM- lines. Further, we found that TPMs are associated with expression of gene programs regulated by a wide array of ETS-factors in both cell lines and primary glioblastoma tissues. This work contributes a unique TPM cell line reagent, establishes TPM status for many deeply-profiled cell lines, and catalogs TPM-associated vulnerabilities.

We aimed to identify molecular drivers for metastasis and devise corresponding therapeutic strategies.We performed an unbiased in vivo genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout (KO) screening in peritoneal dissemination using genetically engineered GC mouse models. Candidate genes were validated through in vivo transplantation assays using KO cells. We analyzed target expression patterns in GC clinical samples using immunohistochemistry. The functional contributions of target genes were studied through knockdown, KO, and overexpression approaches in tumorsphere and organoid assays. Small chemical inhibitors against Bcl-2 members and YAP were tested in vitro and in vivo.We identified Nf2 and Rasa1 as metastasis-suppressing genes through the screening. Clinically, RASA1 mutations along with low NF2 expression define a distinct molecular subtype of metastatic GC exhibiting aggressive traits. NF2 and RASA1 deficiency increased in vivo metastasis and in vitro tumorsphere formation by synergistically amplifying Wnt and YAP signaling in cancer stem cells (CSCs). NF2 deficiency enhanced Bcl-2-mediated Wnt signaling, conferring resistance to YAP inhibition in CSCs. This resistance was counteracted via synthetic lethality achieved by simultaneous inhibition of YAP and Bcl-2. RASA1 deficiency amplified the Wnt pathway via Bcl-xL, contributing to cancer stemness. RASA1 mutation created vulnerability to Bcl-xL inhibition, but the additional NF2 deletion conferred resistance to Bcl-xL inhibition due to YAP activation. The combined inhibition of Bcl-xL and YAP synergistically suppressed cancer stemness and in vivo metastasis in RASA1 and NF2 co-deficiency.Our research unveils the intricate interplay between YAP and Bcl-2 family members, which can lead to synthetic lethality, offering a potential strategy to overcome drug resistance.

Using a candidate drug screen, we identified that inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases 12 and 13 (CDK12/13) dramatically sensitizes diverse models of TNBC to EGFR blockade. This combination therapy drives cell death through the 4E-BP1-dependent suppression of the translation and translation-linked turnover of driver oncoproteins, including MYC. A genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen identified the CCR4-NOT complex as a major determinant of sensitivity to the combination therapy whose loss renders 4E-BP1 unresponsive to drug-induced dephosphorylation, thereby rescuing MYC translational suppression and promoting MYC stability. The central roles of CCR4-NOT and 4E-BP1 in response to the combination therapy were further underscored by the observation of CNOT1 loss and rescue of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in TNBC cells that naturally evolved therapy resistance. Thus, pharmacological inhibition of CDK12/13 reveals a long-proposed EGFR dependence in TNBC that functions through the cooperative regulation of translation-coupled oncoprotein stability."

However, comprehensive chemical screens in diverse biological models are impractical. To address this challenge, we developed ChemProbe, a model that predicts cellular sensitivity to hundreds of molecular probes and drugs by learning to combine transcriptomes and chemical structures. Using ChemProbe, we inferred the chemical sensitivity of cancer cell lines and tumor samples and analyzed how the model makes predictions. We retrospectively evaluated drug response predictions for precision breast cancer treatment and prospectively validated chemical sensitivity predictions in new cellular models, including a genetically modified cell line. Our model interpretation analysis identified transcriptome features reflecting compound targets and protein network modules, identifying genes that drive ferroptosis. ChemProbe is an interpretablein silicoscreening tool that allows researchers to measure cellular response to diverse compounds, facilitating research into molecular mechanisms of chemical sensitivity."

Many cancers express DUX4 but it is unknown whether this generates cells similar to early embryonic stem cells. Here we identified cancer cell lines that express DUX4 and showed that DUX4 is transiently expressed in a small subset of the cells. DUX4 expression activates the DUX4-regulated ZGA transcriptional program, the subsequent 8C-like program, and markers of early embryonic lineages, while suppressing steady-state and interferon-induced MHC class I expression. Although DUX4 was expressed in a small number of cells under standard culture conditions, DNA damage or changes in growth conditions increased the fraction of cells expressing DUX4 and its downstream programs. Our demonstration that transient expression of endogenous DUX4 in cancer cells induces a metastable early embryonic stem cell program and suppresses antigen presentation has implications for cancer growth, progression, and immune evasion.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

Here, based on the analysis of the splicing variants of an oncogene Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) in The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets that contain 9193 patients of 33 cancer subtypes, we found that Box 6/Box 7-containing FAK variants (FAK6/7) were observed in 7 (87.5%) of 8 pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas and 20 (11.76%) of 170 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs). We tested FAK variants in 157 tumor samples collected from Chinese patients with pancreatic tumors, and found that FAK6/7was positive in 34 (75.6%) of 45 pancreatic NENs, 19 (47.5%) of 40 pancreatic solid pseudopapillary neoplasms, and 2 (2.9%) of 69 PDACs. We further tested FAK splicing variants in breast neuroendocrine carcinoma (BrNECs), and found that FAK6/7was positive in 14 (93.3%) of 15 BrNECs but 0 in 23 non-NEC breast cancers. We explored the underlying mechanisms and found that a splicing factor serine/arginine repetitive matrix protein 4 (SRRM4) was overexpressed in FAK6/7-positive pancreatic tumors and breast tumors, which promoted the formation of FAK6/7in cells. These results suggested that FAK6/7could be a biomarker of NENs and represent a potential therapeutic target for these orphan diseases.© 2023. Higher Education Press."

"597",37679326,"A new wave of innovations within the DNA damage response.","Signal Transduct Target Ther","Genome instability has been identified as one of the enabling hallmarks in cancer. DNA damage response (DDR) network is responsible for maintenance of genome integrity in cells. As cancer cells frequently carry DDR gene deficiencies or suffer from replicative stress, targeting DDR processes could induce excessive DNA damages (or unrepaired DNA) that eventually lead to cell death. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have brought impressive benefit to patients with breast cancer gene (BRCA) mutation or homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), which proves the concept of synthetic lethality in cancer treatment. Moreover, the other two scenarios of DDR inhibitor application, replication stress and combination with chemo- or radio- therapy, are under active clinical exploration. In this review, we revisited the progress of DDR targeting therapy beyond the launched first-generation PARP inhibitors. Next generation PARP1 selective inhibitors, which could maintain the efficacy while mitigating side effects, may diversify the application scenarios of PARP inhibitor in clinic. Albeit with unavoidable on-mechanism toxicities, several small molecules targeting DNA damage checkpoints (gatekeepers) have shown great promise in preliminary clinical results, which may warrant further evaluations. In addition, inhibitors for other DNA repair pathways (caretakers) are also under active preclinical or clinical development. With these progresses and efforts, we envision that a new wave of innovations within DDR has come of age.© 2023. West China Hospital, Sichuan University."
"598",37678920,NA,NA,"Phenotypic heterogeneity of melanoma cells contributes to drug tolerance, increased metastasis, and immune evasion in patients with progressive disease. Diverse mechanisms have been individually reported to shape extensive intra-tumor and inter-tumor phenotypic heterogeneity, such as IFNγ signaling and proliferative to invasive transition, but how their crosstalk impacts tumor progression remains largely elusive.Here, we integrate dynamical systems modeling with transcriptomic data analysis at bulk and single-cell levels to investigate underlying mechanisms behind phenotypic heterogeneity in melanoma and its impact on adaptation to targeted therapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors. We construct a minimal core regulatory network involving transcription factors implicated in this process and identify the multiple 'attractors' in the phenotypic landscape enabled by this network. Our model predictions about synergistic control of PD-L1 by IFNγ signaling and proliferative to invasive transition were validated experimentally in three melanoma cell lines-MALME3, SK-MEL-5 and A375.We demonstrate that the emergent dynamics of our regulatory network comprising MITF, SOX10, SOX9, JUN and ZEB1 can recapitulate experimental observations about the co-existence of diverse phenotypes (proliferative, neural crest-like, invasive) and reversible cell-state transitions among them, including in response to targeted therapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors. These phenotypes have varied levels of PD-L1, driving heterogeneity in immunosuppression. This heterogeneity in PD-L1 can be aggravated by combinatorial dynamics of these regulators with IFNγ signaling. Our model predictions about changes in proliferative to invasive transition and PD-L1 levels as melanoma cells evade targeted therapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors were validated in multiple RNA-seq data sets from in vitro and in vivo experiments.Our calibrated dynamical model offers a platform to test combinatorial therapies and provide rational avenues for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. This improved understanding of crosstalk among PD-L1 expression, proliferative to invasive transition and IFNγ signaling can be leveraged to improve the clinical management of therapy-resistant and metastatic melanoma.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

This model utilizes insulin and LXR receptor ligand T0901317, eliminating the need for fatty acid treatment. Significant increases in triglycerides (TAGs) and expression of DNL-related transcription factors were observed. Transcriptomic analysis revealed distinct gene expression profiles between the DNL and conventional oleic acid (OA)-induced steatosis model. DNL steatosis model exhibited elevated pathways related to glycolysis, cholesterol homeostasis, and bile acid metabolism, reflecting its clinical relevance to MAFLD. Moreover, C75 and JNK-IN-5A compounds effectively reduced TAG accumulation and steatosis-related protein expression in the DNL model, whereas they had no significant impact on TAG accumulation in the OA model. In conclusion, we introduce an ideal model for steatosis study, which could help in understanding the MAFLD mechanisms.© 2023."

By integrating 8 previously established genomic signatures for GAC subtypes, we identified 6 clinically and molecularly distinct genomic consensus subtypes (CGSs). CGS1 have the poorest prognosis, very high stem cell characteristics, and high IGF1 expression, but low genomic alterations. CGS2 is enriched with canonical epithelial gene expression. CGS3 and CGS4 have high copy number alterations and low immune reactivity. However, CGS3 and CGS4 differ in that CGS3 has high HER2 activation, while CGS4 has high SALL4 and KRAS activation. CGS5 has the high mutation burden and moderately high immune reactivity that are characteristic of microsatellite instable tumors. Most CGS6 tumors are positive for Epstein Barr virus and show extremely high levels of methylation and high immune reactivity. In a systematic analysis of genomic and proteomic data, we estimated the potential response rate of each consensus subtype to standard and experimental treatments such as radiation therapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. Interestingly, CGS3 was significantly associated with a benefit from chemoradiation therapy owing to its high basal level of ferroptosis. In addition, we also identified potential therapeutic targets for each consensus subtype. Thus, the consensus subtypes produced a robust classification and provide for additional characterizations for subtype-based customized interventions.© 2023.

In this study, we have characterized a human cell line, IGROV-1, as a robust tool to detect, propagate, and titrate betacoronaviruses SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-OC43. IGROV-1 cells can be used for serological assays, antiviral drug testing, and isolating SARS-CoV-2 variants from patient samples. Using time-course transcriptomics, we confirmed that IGROV-1 cells exhibit a robust innate immune response upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, recapitulating the response previously observed in primary human nasal epithelial cells. We performed genome-wide CRISPR knockout genetic screens in IGROV-1 cells and identified Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) as a critical host dependency factor for both SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-OC43. Using DiMNF, a small molecule inhibitor of AHR, we observed that the drug selectively inhibits HCoV-OC43 infection but not SARS-CoV-2. Transcriptomic analysis in primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells revealed that DiMNF blocks HCoV-OC43 infection via basal activation of innate immune responses. Our findings highlight the potential of IGROV-1 cells as a valuable diagnostic and research tool to combat betacoronavirus diseases."

However, the aberrant expression of HNRNPA2B1 in Breast Cancer (BC) and its clinical significance still need to be further studied.We used related databases to analyze the relationship between HNRNPA2B1 and BC by bioinformatics. Then, we further detected the expression of HNRNPA2B1 by immunohistochemical method, and analyzed the relationship between it and the prognosis of breast cancer by COX regression method.In the study, we found that the expression level of HNRNPA2B1 in breast cancer (BC) was significantly higher than that in normal breast tissues. In addition, the expression level of HNRNPA2B1 in BC samples was significantly correlated with clinical indexes such as TNM stage.

GTF2I is an oncogene mutated in a subgroup of thymomas that is reputed to drive their growth. However, for GTF2I wild-type tumors, the relevant mutations remain to be identified.We performed a meta-analysis and identified 4,208 mutations in 339 patients. We defined a panel of 63 genes frequently mutated in thymic epithelial tumors, which we used to design a custom assay for next-generation sequencing. We sequenced tumor DNA from 67 thymomas of patients with myasthenia gravis who underwent resection in our institution.Among the 67 thymomas, there were 238 mutations, 83 of which were in coding sequences. There were 14 GTF2I mutations in 6 A, 5 AB, 2 B2 thymomas, and one in a thymoma with unspecified histology. No other oncogenes showed recurrent mutations, while sixteen tumor suppressor genes were predicted to be inactivated. Even with a dedicated assay for the identification of specific somatic mutations in thymic epithelial tumors, only GTF2I mutations were found to be significantly recurrent.Our evaluation provides insights into the mutational landscape of thymic epithelial tumors, identifies recurrent mutations in different histotypes, and describes the design and implementation of a custom panel for targeted resequencing.

However, real-world evidence reveals that a large subset of HER2+/ER+ patients receive ET as monotherapy, positioning this treatment pattern as a clinical challenge. In the present study, we developed and characterized two distinctin vitromodels of ET-resistant (ETR) HER2+/ER+ BCa to identify possible therapeutic vulnerabilities.To mimic ETR to aromatase inhibitors (AI), we developed two long-term estrogen-deprived (LTED) cell lines from BT-474 (BT474) and MDA-MB-361 (MM361). Growth assays, PAM50 molecular subtyping, genomic and transcriptomic analyses, followed by validation and functional studies, were used to identify targetable differences between ET-responsive parental and ETR-LTED HER2+/ER+ cells.Compared to their parental cells, MM361 LTEDs grew faster, lost ER, and increased HER2 expression, whereas BT474 LTEDs grew slower and maintained ER and HER2 expression. Both LTED variants had reduced responsiveness to fulvestrant. Whole-genome sequencing of the more aggressive MM361 LTED model system identified exonic mutations in genes encoding transcription factors and chromatin modifiers. Single-cell RNA sequencing demonstrated a shift towards non-luminal phenotypes, and revealed metabolic remodeling of MM361 LTEDs, with upregulated lipid metabolism and antioxidant genes associated with ferroptosis, includingGPX4. Combining the GPX4 inhibitor RSL3 with anti-HER2 agents induced significant cell death in both the MM361 and BT474 LTEDs.The BT474 and MM361 AI-resistant models capture distinct phenotypes of HER2+/ER+ BCa and identify altered lipid metabolism and ferroptosis remodeling as vulnerabilities of this type of ETR BCa."

ARTHS is clinically heterogeneous and characterized by several common features, including intellectual disability, developmental and speech delay, and hypotonia, and affects multiple organ systems. KAT6A is the enzymatic core of a histone-acetylation protein complex; however, the direct histone targets and gene regulatory effects remain unknown. In this study, we use ARTHS patient (n = 8) and control (n = 14) dermal fibroblasts and perform comprehensive profiling of the epigenome and transcriptome caused by KAT6A mutations. We identified differential chromatin accessibility within the promoter or gene body of 23% (14/60) of genes that were differentially expressed between ARTHS and controls. Within fibroblasts, we show a distinct set of genes from the posterior HOXC gene cluster (HOXC10, HOXC11, HOXC-AS3, HOXC-AS2, and HOTAIR) that are overexpressed in ARTHS and are transcription factors critical for early development body segment patterning. The genomic loci harboring HOXC genes are epigenetically regulated with increased chromatin accessibility, high levels of H3K23ac, and increased gene-body DNA methylation compared to controls, all of which are consistent with transcriptomic overexpression. Finally, we used unbiased proteomic mass spectrometry and identified two new histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) that are disrupted in ARTHS: H2A and H3K56 acetylation. Our multi-omics assays have identified novel histone and gene regulatory roles of KAT6A in a large group of ARTHS patients harboring diverse pathogenic mutations.

Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) provides objective parameters of functional capacity (e.g., oxygen consumption at peak exercise, peak VO2), with significant prognostication for postoperative complications. However, sex-specific thresholds for functional capacity to predict surgical risk are yet to be established. Therefore, we performed apost hocanalysis of the international, multicentre, prospective observational METS (Measurement of Exercise Tolerance before Surgery) study to evaluate if sex-specific thresholds of peak VO2improve risk prediction of postoperative complications.We undertook apost hocanalysis (HREC/71824/PMCC) of the METS study, which was performed between March 2013 and March 2016. We investigated whether sex-specific differences exist for CPET-derived parameters and associated thresholds for predicting postoperative complications in this large cohort of patients that had major non-cardiac surgery (n = 1266). Logistic regression models were analyzed for the association of low peak VO2with moderate-to-severe in-hospital postoperative complications. Optimal sex-specific peak VO2thresholds were obtained by maximizing the Youden index of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Finally, multivariable logistic regression models tested the resulting sex-specific thresholds against the established non-sex-specific peak VO2threshold (14 mL kg-1min-1) adjusted for clinically relevant features such as comorbidities and surgical complexity. Models were evaluated by bootstrapping optimism-corrected area under the ROC curve and the net reclassification improvement index (NRI).Female patients (n = 480) had a lower mean (SD) peak VO2than males (16.7 (4.9) mL kg-1min-1versus 21.2 (6.5) mL kg-1min-1, p < 0.001) and a lower postoperative complication rate (10.4% versus 15.3%; p = 0.018) than males (n = 786). The optimal peak VO2threshold for predicting postoperative complications was 12.4 mL kg-1min-1for females and 22.3 mL kg-1min-1for males, respectively. In the multivariable regression model, low non-sex-specific peak VO2did not independently predict postoperative complications. In contrast, low sex-specific peak VO2was an independent predictor of postoperative complications (OR 2.29; 95% CI: 1.60, 3.30; p < 0.001). The optimism-corrected AUC-ROC of the sex-specific model was higher compared with the non-sex-specific model (0.73 versus 0.7; DeLong's test: p = 0.021). The sex-specific model classified 39% of the patients more correctly than the baseline model (NRI = 0.39; 95% CI: 0.24, 0.55). In contrast, the non-sex-specific model only classified 9% of the patients more correctly when compared against the baseline model (NRI = 0.09; 95% CI: -0.04, 0.22).Our data report sex-specific differences in preoperative CPET-derived functional capacity parameters. Sex-specific peak VO2thresholds identify patients at increased risk for postoperative complications with a higher discriminatory ability than a sex-unspecific threshold. As such, sex-specific threshold values should be considered in preoperative CPET to potentially improve risk stratification and to guide surgical decision-making, including eligibility for surgery, preoperative optimization strategies (prehabilitation) or seeking non-surgical options.There was no funding for the present study.

Correction of the SAMe deficiency that is characteristic of the AD brain may attenuate or prevent pathological processes driving AD-associated neurodegeneration including aberrant tau hyperphosphorylation and DNA hypomethylation.The primary aim is to test the hypothesis that daily treatment with 400 mg oral SAMe for 180 days will lead to a greater reduction from baseline in plasma levels of p-tau181 compared to placebo in patients with mild cognitive impairment or dementia due to AD.This is a phase II, randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial among 60 participants with mild cognitive impairment or dementia due to AD. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either SAMe or matching placebo, to be taken as an adjunct to their AD standard of care.The primary outcome is change in plasma p-tau181 concentration between baseline and following 180 days of treatment, which will be compared between the active and placebo group. Secondary outcomes are the safety of SAMe administration (incidence of serious adverse events), change from baseline in cognitive performance (as measured by the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status), and epigenetic changes in DNA methylation.Demonstration of effective and safe lowering of plasma p-tau181 with SAMe in this phase II trial would pave the way for an exciting field of translational research and a larger phase III trial."

This study aimed to identify molecular biomarkers influencing patients with T2DM living in high-altitude areas by analyzing lncRNA and mRNA.RNA sequencing and bioinformatics analyses were used to identify significantly expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs in T2DM and healthy control groups. Coding potential was analyzed using coding-noncoding indices, the coding potential calculator, and PFAM, and the lncRNA function was predicted using Pearson's correlation. Differentially expressed transcripts between the groups were identified, and Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses were performed to identify the biological functions of both lncRNAs and mRNAs.We assembled 1766 lncRNAs in the T2DM group, of which 582 were novel. This study identified three lncRNA target genes (KLF2, CREBBP, andREL) and seven mRNAs (PIK3CD, PIK3R5, IL6R, TYK2, ZAP70, LAMTOR4, andSSH2) significantly enriched in important pathways, playing a role in the progression of T2DM.To the best of our knowledge, this comprehensive study is the first to explore the applicability of certain lncRNAs as diagnostic or management biomarkers for T2DM in females in Taif City, Saudi Arabia through the genome-wide identification of lncRNA and mRNA profiling using RNA seq and bioinformatics analysis.

We are now entering a new phase of MEI discovery where these methods are being replaced by whole genome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis to discover novel MEIs. We expect that the universe of sequenced human genomes will continue to expand rapidly over the next several years, both with short-read and long-read technologies. These resources will provide unprecedented opportunities to discover MEIs and study their impact on human traits and diseases. They also will allow the MEI community to discover and study the source elements that produce these new MEIs, which will facilitate our ability to study source element regulation in various tissue contexts and disease states.

High-throughput microbiome sequencing enables studying microbial communities but suffers from analytical challenges. In particular, the lack of dedicated preprocessing methods to improve data quality impedes effective minimization of biases prior to downstream analysis. This review aims to address this gap by providing a comprehensive overview of preprocessing techniques relevant to microbiome research. We outline a typical workflow for microbiome data analysis. Preprocessing methods discussed include quality filtering, batch effect correction, imputation of missing values, normalization, and data transformation. We highlight strengths and limitations of each technique to serve as a practical guide for researchers and identify areas needing further methodological development. Establishing robust, standardized preprocessing will be essential for drawing valid biological conclusions from microbiome studies.© 2023 The Authors."

Constructing such references requires integration of heterogeneous cohorts with varying metadata. Here we present single-cell population level integration (scPoli), an open-world learner that incorporates generative models to learn sample and cell representations for data integration, label transfer and reference mapping. We applied scPoli on population-level atlases of lung and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, the latter consisting of 7.8 million cells across 2,375 samples. We demonstrate that scPoli can explain sample-level biological and technical variations using sample embeddings revealing genes associated with batch effects and biological effects. scPoli is further applicable to single-cell sequencing assay for transposase-accessible chromatin and cross-species datasets, offering insights into chromatin accessibility and comparative genomics. We envision scPoli becoming an important tool for population-level single-cell data integration facilitating atlas use but also interpretation by means of multi-scale analyses.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Alternative splicing is a highly regulated process influenced by specific cell types and has been implicated in age-related disorders such as neurodegenerative diseases. A comprehensive detection of alternative splicing events (ASEs) at the cellular level in postmortem brain tissue can provide valuable insights into AD pathology. Here, we provided cell-level ASEs in postmortem brain tissue by employing bioinformatics pipelines on a bulk RNA sequencing study sorted by cell types and two single-cell RNA sequencing studies from the prefrontal cortex. This comprehensive analysis revealed previously overlooked splicing and expression changes in AD patient brains. Among the observed alterations were changed in the splicing and expression of transcripts associated with chaperones, includingCLUin astrocytes and excitatory neurons,PTGDSin astrocytes and endothelial cells, andHSP90AA1in microglia and tauopathy-afflicted neurons, which were associated with differential expression of the splicing factorDDX5. In addition, novel, unknown transcripts were altered, and structural changes were observed in lncRNAs such asMEG3in neurons. This work provides a novel strategy to identify the notable ASEs at the cell level in neurodegeneration, which revealed cell type-specific splicing changes in AD. This finding may contribute to interpreting associations between splicing and neurodegenerative disease outcomes.Copyright © 2023 Farhadieh and Ghaedi."
"618",37770437,"scBridge embraces cell heterogeneity in single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data integration.","Nat Commun","Single-cell multi-omics data integration aims to reduce the omics difference while keeping the cell type difference. However, it is daunting to model and distinguish the two differences due to cell heterogeneity. Namely, even cells of the same omics and type would have various features, making the two differences less significant. In this work, we reveal that instead of being an interference, cell heterogeneity could be exploited to improve data integration. Specifically, we observe that the omics difference varies in cells, and cells with smaller omics differences are easier to be integrated. Hence, unlike most existing works that homogeneously treat and integrate all cells, we propose a multi-omics data integration method (dubbed scBridge) that integrates cells in a heterogeneous manner. In brief, scBridge iterates between i) identifying reliable scATAC-seq cells that have smaller omics differences, and ii) integrating reliable scATAC-seq cells with scRNA-seq data to narrow the omics gap, thus benefiting the integration for the rest cells. Extensive experiments on seven multi-omics datasets demonstrate the superiority of scBridge compared with six representative baselines.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."

We showed that modeling both types of RNA counts can improve robustness in statistical estimation and can reveal new aspects of dynamic changes that can be missed in static analysis. We showcase that our modeling framework can be used to identify statistically significant dynamic gene programs in pancreatic cancer data. Our results discovered that seven dynamic gene programs (topics) are highly correlated with cancer prognosis and generally enrich immune cell types and pathways.© 2023 The Author(s)."

The BNST is a sexually dimorphic and highly complex structure as already evident by its anatomy consisting of 11 to 18 distinct sub-nuclei in rodents. Located in the ventral forebrain, the BNST is anatomically and functionally connected to many other limbic structures, including the amygdala, hypothalamic nuclei, basal ganglia, and hippocampus. Given this extensive connectivity, the BNST is thought to play a central and critical role in the integration of information on hedonic-valence, mood, arousal states, processing emotional information, and in general shape motivated and stress/anxiety-related behavior. Regarding its role in regulating stress and anxiety behavior the anterolateral group of the BNST (BNSTALG) has been extensively studied and contains a wide variety of neurons that differ in their electrophysiological properties, morphology, spatial organization, neuropeptidergic content and input and output synaptic organization which shape their activity and function. In addition to this great diversity, further species-specific differences are evident on multiple levels. For example, classic studies performed in adult rat brain identified three distinct neuron types(Type I-III)based on their electrophysiological properties and ion channel expression. Whilst similar neurons have been identified in other animal species, such as mice and non-human primates such as macaques, cross-species comparisons have revealed intriguing differences such as their comparative prevalence in the BNSTALGas well as their electrophysiological and morphological properties, amongst other differences. Given this tremendous complexity on multiple levels, the comprehensive elucidation of the BNSTALGcircuitry and its role in regulating stress/anxiety-related behavior is a major challenge. In the present Review we bring together and highlight the key differences in BNSTALGstructure, functional connectivity, the electrophysiological and morphological properties, and neuropeptidergic profiles of BNSTALGneurons between species with the aim to facilitate future studies of this important nucleus in relation to human disease.Copyright © 2023 van de Poll, Cras and Ellender."

To systematically trace its cellular and molecular origins, we established a spatially resolved cell type atlas of the entire brain of the sea lamprey-a jawless species whose phylogenetic position affords the reconstruction of ancestral vertebrate traits-based on extensive single-cell RNA-seq and in situ sequencing data. Comparisons of this atlas to neural data from the mouse and other jawed vertebrates unveiled various shared features that enabled the reconstruction of cell types, tissue structures and gene expression programs of the ancestral vertebrate brain. However, our analyses also revealed key tissues and cell types that arose later in evolution. For example, the ancestral brain was probably devoid of cerebellar cell types and oligodendrocytes (myelinating cells); our data suggest that the latter emerged from astrocyte-like evolutionary precursors in the jawed vertebrate lineage. Altogether, our work illuminates the cellular and molecular architecture of the ancestral vertebrate brain and provides a foundation for exploring its diversification during evolution.© 2023.

For current data integration methods, the feasibility of cross-modal integration relies on the existence of highly correlated, a priori 'linked' features. We describe matching X-modality via fuzzy smoothed embedding (MaxFuse), a cross-modal data integration method that, through iterative coembedding, data smoothing and cell matching, uses all information in each modality to obtain high-quality integration even when features are weakly linked. MaxFuse is modality-agnostic and demonstrates high robustness and accuracy in the weak linkage scenario, achieving 20~70% relative improvement over existing methods under key evaluation metrics on benchmarking datasets. A prototypical example of weak linkage is the integration of spatial proteomic data with single-cell sequencing data. On two example analyses of this type, MaxFuse enabled the spatial consolidation of proteomic, transcriptomic and epigenomic information at single-cell resolution on the same tissue section.© 2023.

For example, through rapid glutamate release, astrocytes can control excitability, plasticity and synchronous activity2,3of synaptic networks, while also contributing to their dysregulation in neuropsychiatric conditions4-7. For astrocytes to communicate through fast focal glutamate release, they should possess an apparatus for Ca2+-dependent exocytosis similar to neurons8-10. However, the existence of this mechanism has been questioned11-13owing to inconsistent data14-17and a lack of direct supporting evidence. Here we revisited the astrocyte glutamate exocytosis hypothesis by considering the emerging molecular heterogeneity of astrocytes18-21and using molecular, bioinformatic and imaging approaches, together with cell-specific genetic tools that interfere with glutamate exocytosis in vivo. By analysing existing single-cell RNA-sequencing databases and our patch-seq data, we identified nine molecularly distinct clusters of hippocampal astrocytes, among which we found a notable subpopulation that selectively expressed synaptic-like glutamate-release machinery and localized to discrete hippocampal sites. Using GluSnFR-based glutamate imaging22in situ and in vivo, we identified a corresponding astrocyte subgroup that responds reliably to astrocyte-selective stimulations with subsecond glutamate release events at spatially precise hotspots, which were suppressed by astrocyte-targeted deletion of vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1). Furthermore, deletion of this transporter or its isoform VGLUT2 revealed specific contributions of glutamatergic astrocytes in cortico-hippocampal and nigrostriatal circuits during normal behaviour and pathological processes. By uncovering this atypical subpopulation of specialized astrocytes in the adult brain, we provide insights into the complex roles of astrocytes in central nervous system (CNS) physiology and diseases, and identify a potential therapeutic target.© 2023.

"627",37736302,NA,NA,"Background:A growing body of literature has reported molecular and histological changes in the human placenta in association with preeclampsia (PE). Placental DNA methylation (DNAme) and transcriptomic patterns have revealed molecular subgroups of PE that are associated with placental histopathology and clinical phenotypes of the disease. However, the clinical and molecular heterogeneity of PE both across and within subtypes complicates the study of this disease. PE is most strongly associated with placental pathology and adverse fetal and maternal outcomes when it develops early in pregnancy. We focused on placentae from pregnancies affected by preeclampsia that were delivered before 34 weeks of gestation to develop eoPred, a predictor of the DNAme signature associated with the placental phenotype of early-onset preeclampsia (EOPE).Results:Public data from 83 placental samples (HM450K), consisting of 42 EOPE and 41 normotensive preterm birth (nPTB) cases, was used to develop eoPred-a supervised model that relies on a highly discriminative 45 CpG DNAme signature of EOPE in the placenta. The performance of eoPred was assessed using cross-validation (AUC = 0.95) and tested in an independent validation cohort (n= 49, AUC = 0.725). A subset of fetal growth restriction (FGR) and late-PE cases showed a similar DNAme profile at the 45 predictive CpGs, consistent with the overlap in placental pathology between these conditions. The relationship between the EOPE probability generated by eoPred and various phenotypic variables was also assessed, revealing that it is associated with gestational age, and it is not driven by cell composition differences.Conclusion:eoPred relies on a 45-CpG DNAme signature to predict a homogeneous placental phenotype of EOPE in a discrete or continuous manner. Using this classifier should 1) aid in the study of placental insufficiency and improve the consistency of future placental DNAme studies of PE, 2) facilitate identifying the placental phenotype of EOPE in public data sets and 3) importantly, standardize the placental diagnosis of EOPE to allow better cross-cohort comparisons. Lastly, classification of cases with eoPred will be useful for investigating the relationship between placental pathology and genetic or environmental variables.Copyright © 2023 Fernández-Boyano, Inkster, Yuan and Robinson."

Consistently, microbiota-gut-brain axis has been found altered in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We reasoned that such alterations occurring in ASD may impact both on methylation signatures of human host fecal DNA (HFD) and possibly on the types of human cells shed in the stools from intestinal tract giving origin to HFD. To test this hypothesis, we have performed whole genome methylation analysis of HFD from an age-restricted cohort of young children with ASD (N = 8) and healthy controls (N = 7). In the same cohort we have previously investigated the fecal microbiota composition and here we refined such analysis and searched for eventual associations with data derived from HFD methylome analysis. Our results showed that specific epigenetic signatures in human fecal DNA, especially at genes related to inflammation, associated with the disease. By applying methylation-based deconvolution algorithm, we found that the HFD derived mainly from immune cells and the relative abundance of those differed between patients and controls. Consistently, most of differentially methylated regions fitted with genes involved in inflammatory response. Interestingly, using Horvath epigenetic clock, we found that ASD affected children showed both epigenetic and microbiota age accelerated. We believe that the present unprecedented approach may be useful for the identification of the ASD associated HFD epigenetic signatures and may be potentially extended to other brain disorders and intestinal inflammatory diseases.© 2023.

In this study, temporal muscle inactivation inDrosophilalarvae carrying a temperature-sensitive mutation in theshibire(shi1) gene was induced to mimic sedentary behavior during early life and study its transcriptional outcome. Our findings indicated a significant change in the epigenetic profile, as well as the genomic profile, of RNA Pol II binding in the inactive muscles relative to control, within a relatively short time period. Whole-genome analysis of RNA-Pol II binding to DNA by muscle-specific targeted DamID (TaDa) protocol revealed that muscle inactivity altered Pol II binding in 121 out of 2010 genes (6%), with a three-fold enrichment of genes coding for lncRNAs. The suppressed protein-coding genes included genes associated with longevity, DNA repair, muscle function, and ubiquitin-dependent proteostasis. Moreover, inducing muscle inactivation exerted a multi-level impact upon chromatin modifications, triggering an altered epigenetic balance of active versus inactive marks. The downregulated genes in the inactive muscles included genes essential for muscle structure and function, carbohydrate metabolism, longevity, and others. Given the multiple analogous genes inDrosophilafor many human genes, extrapolating our findings to humans may hold promise for establishing a molecular link between sedentary behavior and metabolic diseases."

These cells employ immunosuppressive ligands to evade detection and elimination by the immune system. Therefore, the discovery and characterization of novel immunosuppressive ligands that facilitate immune evasion are crucial for developing more potent anti-cancer therapies.We conducted gain-of-function screens using a CRISPRa (CRISPR activation) library that covered the entire human transmembrane sub-genome to identify surface molecules capable of hindering NK-mediated cytotoxicity. The immunosuppressive role and mechanism of MUC21 were validated using NK and T cell mediated cytotoxicity assays. Bioinformatics tools were employed to assess the clinical implications of mucin-21 (MUC21) in cancer cell immunity.Our genetic screens revealed that MUC21 expression on cancer cell surfaces inhibits both the cytotoxic activity of NK cells and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, but not affecting complement-dependent cytotoxicity. Additionally, MUC21 expression hinders T cell activation by impeding antigen recognition, thereby diminishing the effectiveness of the immune checkpoint inhibitor, anti-PD-L1. Moreover, MUC21 expression suppress the antitumor function of both CAR-T cells and CAR-NK cells. Mechanistically, MUC21 facilitates immune evasion by creating steric hindrance, preventing interactions between cancer and immune cells. Bioinformatics analysis revealed elevated MUC21 expression in lung cancer, which correlated with reduced infiltration and activation of cytotoxic immune cells. Intriguingly, MUC21 expression was higher in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors that were non-responsive to anti-PD-(L)1 treatment compared to responsive tumors.These findings indicate that surface MUC21 serves as a potent immunosuppressive ligand, shielding cancer cells from NK and CD8+T cell attacks. This suggests that inhibiting MUC21 could be a promising strategy to improve cancer immunotherapy.© 2023. Italian National Cancer Institute ‘Regina Elena’."

The clinical value of GGH on prognosis was evaluated. The relationship between GGH and immune infiltration was assessed by CIBERSORT, EPIC, ssGSEA, unsupervised clustering and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Additionally, we investigated the effect of GGH knockdown in vitro.Among the GGH, CDKN2A, and SIX1 genes, the impact of GGH was predominant on immune infiltration in UCEC. A nomogram containing GGH and other clinical features showed good predictive performance via curve analysis (DCA). In the functional analysis, GGH affected differentiation, tumour proliferation, and immune regulation. The immunosuppressive components were enriched in the GGH-high group, with poor immunotherapy efficacy.

We leveraged diverse datasets to extensively evaluate tool performance across different intronic regions, distinguishing between variants that are expected to disrupt splicing through different molecular mechanisms. Notably, we compared the performance of SpliceAI, a widely used sequence-based deep learning model, with that of more recent methods that extend its original implementation. We observed considerable differences in tool performance depending on the region considered, with variants generating cryptic splice sites being better predicted than those that potentially affect splicing regulatory elements. Finally, we devised a novel quantitative assessment of tool interpretability and found that tools providing mechanistic explanations of their predictions are often correct with respect to the ground - information, but the use of these tools results in decreased predictive power when compared to black box methods.Our findings translate into practical recommendations for tool usage and provide a reference framework for applying prediction tools in deep intronic regions, enabling more informed decision-making by practitioners.© The Author(s) 2023.

Existing approaches to generating synthetic benchmarking datasets result in the generation of naive repertoires missing the key feature of many shared receptor sequences (selected for common antigens) found in antigen-experienced repertoires.We demonstrate that a common approach to generating simulated AIRR benchmark datasets can introduce biases, which may be exploited for undesired shortcut learning by certain ML methods. To mitigate undesirable access to true signals in simulated AIRR datasets, we devised a simulation strategy (simAIRR) that constructs antigen-experienced-like repertoires with a realistic overlap of receptor sequences. simAIRR can be used for constructing AIRR-level benchmarks based on a range of assumptions (or experimental data sources) for what constitutes receptor-level immune signals.

Despite being a part of a eukaryotic host cell, the mitochondria contain a separate genome whose origin is linked with the endosymbiosis of a prokaryotic cell by the host cell and encode independent genomic information throughout their genomes. Mitochondrial genomes accommodate essential genes and are regularly utilized in biotechnology and phylogenetics. Various assemblers capable of generating complete mitochondrial genomes are being continuously developed. These tools often use whole-genome sequencing data as an input containing reads from the mitochondrial genome. Till now, no published work has explored the systematic comparison of all the available tools for assembling human mitochondrial genomes using short-read sequencing data. This evaluation is required to identify the best tool that can be well-optimized for small-scale projects or even national-level research.In this study, we have tested the mitochondrial genome assemblers for both simulated datasets and whole genome sequencing (WGS) datasets of humans. For the highest computational setting of 16 computational threads with the simulated dataset having 1000X read depth, MitoFlex took the least execution time of 69 s, and IOGA took the longest execution time of 1278 s. NOVOPlasty utilized the least computational memory of approximately 0.098 GB for the same setting, whereas IOGA utilized the highest computational memory of 11.858 GB. In the case of WGS datasets for humans, GetOrganelle and MitoFlex performed the best in capturing the SNPs information with a mean F1-score of 0.919 at the sequencing depth of 10X. MToolBox and NOVOPlasty performed consistently across all sequencing depths with a mean F1 score of 0.897 and 0.890, respectively.Based on the overall performance metrics and consistency in assembly quality for all sequencing data, MToolBox performed the best. However, NOVOPlasty was the second fastest tool in execution time despite being single-threaded, and it utilized the least computational resources among all the assemblers when tested on simulated datasets. Therefore, NOVOPlasty may be more practical when there is a significant sample size and a lack of computational resources. Besides, as long-read sequencing gains popularity, mitochondrial genome assemblers must be developed to use long-read sequencing data.© 2023. BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature."

At the proviral genome level, exJSRV and enJSRV strains have a high degree of similarity with their main variation regions being the LTR,gag, andenvgenes. In this study, for the first time, we investigated and compared the distribution of CpG islands between these enJSRV and exJSRV strains. Specifically, we analyzed a total of 42 full-length JSRV genomic sequences obtained from the GenBank®database to identify CpG islands in the exJSRV and enJSRV genomes using the MethPrimer software. Our results showed that the CpG islands in the two JSRV strains were mainly distributed in the LTR,gag, andenvgenes. In exJSRVs, 66.66% (6/9), 33.33% (3/9), and 100% (9/9) of the sequences presented at least one CpG island in LTR,gag,envgenes, respectively, and for enJSRVs, 84.84% (28/33), 57.57% (19/33), and 96.96% (32/33) of the sequences presented at least one CpG island in the LTR,gag, andenvgenes. These findings suggested that the distribution, length, and genetic traits of CpG islands were different for the exJSRV and enJSRV strains. In future, it would be necessary to demonstrate the biological significance of CpG islands within these genes in exJSRV and enJSRV genomes. This will enhance understanding regarding the potential role of CpG islands in epigenetic regulation.© 2023 Urmia University. All rights reserved."

Herein, Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) was employed as a bioinformatics technology. LINC02587 is differentially expressed in bladder urothelial cancer, glioblastoma, lung adenocarcinoma, lung SCC, melanoma, and other tumor tissue and cells. However, its impact on the emergence of glioma and its mechanism is remaining elusive.Some of the in vitro assays employed in this study were the CCK-8 / Annexin-V / Transwell assays, colony formation, and wound healing, together with Western blot (WB) evaluation. MSP / BSP assays were employed for assessing the CpG island's methylation status in the LINC02587 promoter. Through transcriptome, ferroptosis-related experiments, and WB evaluation, it was confirmed that LINC02587 is correlated with the regulation of ferroptosis in tumor cells, and CoQ-Fsp1 is one of its regulatory pathways. Moreover, the underlined in-vitro results were further validated by in-vivo studies.The current study shows that the promoter sequence of LINC02587 is regulated by methylation. The silencing of LINC02587 can inhibit cellular proliferative, migrative, and invasive properties, and induce ferroptosis within gliomas through the CoQ-FSP1 pathway.LINC02587 is likely to be a novel drug target in treating glioma.© 2023.

The association between PCa and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) has been reported. Aberrantly expressed lncRNAs have been documented in each of the cancer ""hallmarks"". Androgen signaling plays an important role in PCa progression. This study aimed to profile the aberrantly expressed lncRNAs in androgen-dependent (LNCaP) PCa compared to androgen-independent (PC-3) PCa cells. This was achieved by using a 384-well plate of PCa lncRNA gene panel. Differential expression of ±2 up or downregulation was determined using the CFX Maestro software v2.1. LncSEA and DIANA-miRPath were used to identify the enriched pathways. Telomerase RNA component (TERC) lncRNA was illustrated to participate in various tumourigenic classes by in silico bioinformatics analysis and was thus selected for validation using RT-qPCR. Further bioinformatics analysis revealed the involvement of differentially expressed lncRNAs in oncogenic pathways. Some lncRNAs undergo hypermethylation, others are encapsulated by exosomes, while others interact with several microRNAs (miRNAs), favouring tumourigenic pathways. Notably, TERC lncRNA was shown to interact with tumour-suppressor miRNAs hsa-miR-4429 and hsa-miR-320b. This interaction in turn activates TGF-β-signaling and ECM-receptor interaction pathways, favouring the progression of PCa. Understanding lncRNAs as competitive endogenous RNA molecules and their interactions with miRNAs may aid in the identification of novel prognostic PCa biomarkers and therapeutic targets."

Thus, this study aimed to identifying the role of CYFIP2 in tumors and immune response.In this study, we first explored expression patterns, diagnostic role and prognostic value of CYFIP2 in cancers, particularly in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Then, we performed functional enrichment, genetic alterations, DNA methylation analysis, and immune cell infiltration analysis of CYFIP2 to uncover its potential mechanisms involved in immune microenvironment.We found that CYFIP2 significantly differentially expressed in different tumors including LUAD compared with normal tissues. Furthermore, CYFIP2 was found to be significantly correlated with clinical parameters in LUAD. According to the diagnostic and survival analysis, CYFIP2 may be employed as a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker. Moreover, genetic alterations revealed that mutation of CYFIP2 was the main types of alterations in different cancers. DNA methylation analysis indicated that CYFIP2 mRNA expression correlated with hypomethylation. Afterwards, functional enrichment analysis uncovered that CYFIP2 was involved in tumor-associated and immune-related pathways. Immune infiltration analysis indicated that CYFIP2 was significantly correlated with immune cells infiltration. In particular, CYFIP2 was strongly linked with immune microenvironment scores. Additionally, CYFIP2 exhibited a significant relationship with immune regulators and immune-related genes including chemokines, chemokines receptors, and MHC genes.Our results suggested that CYFIP2 may serve as a prognostic cancer biomarker for determining prognosis and might be a promising therapeutic strategy for tumor immunotherapy.© 2023.

The senescence of EPCs is involved in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Cigarette smoke extract (CSE) can directly induce the dysfunction and increased expression of senescence-related markers in EPCs cultured in vitro. Histone acetyltransferase p300 is a transcriptional activator, and its changes can lead to cell senescence. The present study investigated whether CSE can induce the senescence of EPCs by upregulating p300.EPCs were isolated from bone marrow of C57BL/6J mice by density gradient centrifugation. The p300 inhibitor C646 and agonist CTPB were used to interfere with EPCs, cell cycle and apoptosis were detected by flow cytometry, the proportion of senile cells was counted by β-galactosidase staining, the protein expression of p300, H4K12, Cyclin D1, TERT and Ki67 were detected by western blot.Compared with the control group, the cell cycle of CSE group and CTPB group were blocked, the apoptosis rate and early apoptosis rate were increased, the proportion of senile cells counted by β-galactosidase staining was increased, the expression of p300 and H4K12 protein were increased, the expression of Cyclin D1, TERT and Ki67 protein were decreased. C646 could partly alleviate the damages caused by CSE.CSE may promote the apoptosis and senescence of EPCs by upregulating the expression of p300 and H4K12 protein, thus preventing the transition of EPCs from G1 phase to S phase, affecting telomerase synthesis, and reducing EPCs proliferation.© 2023 Liang G. et al."
"643",37732013,"Early life adverse exposures in irritable bowel syndrome: new insights and opportunities.","Front Pediatr","Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a prevalent functional gastrointestinal disorder worldwide. Extensive research has identified multiple factors contributing to its development, including genetic predisposition, chronic infection, gut dysbiosis, aberrant serotonin metabolism, and brain dysfunction. Recent studies have emphasized the critical role of the early life stage as a susceptibility window for IBS. Current evidence suggests that diet can heighten the risk of IBS in offspring by influencing the microbiota composition, intestinal epithelium structure, gene expression, and brain-gut axis. The use of antibiotics during pregnancy and the neonatal period disrupts the normal gut microbiota structure, aligning it with the characteristics observed in IBS patients. Additionally, early life stress impacts susceptibility to IBS by modulating TLR4, NK1, and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis while compromising the offspring's immune system. Formula feeding facilitates the colonization of pathogenic bacteria in the intestines, concurrently reducing the presence of probiotics. This disruption of the Th1 and Th2 cell balance in the immune system weakens the intestinal epithelial barrier. Furthermore, studies suggest that delivery mode influences the occurrence of IBS by altering the composition of gut microbes. This review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of the existing evidence regarding the impact of adverse early life exposures on IBS during pregnancy, intrapartum, and neonatal period. By consolidating this knowledge, the review enhances our understanding of the direct and indirect mechanisms underlying early life-related IBS and offers new insights and research directions from childhood to adulthood.© 2023 Zhou, Huang, Yu, Zhang, Tao and Zhang."

Accumulated evidence suggested the alteration in epigenetic pathway was associated with clinical features and brain dysfunctions in schizophrenia. DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), a key enzyme for DNA methylation, are related to the development of schizophrenia, whereas the current research evidence is not sufficient. The aim of study was to explore the effects of gene polymorphisms of DNMTs on the susceptibility and symptoms of schizophrenia.The study was case-control study that designed and employed the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fifth Edition (DSM-5) as the diagnostic standard. 134 hospitalized patients with schizophrenia in the Third People's Hospital of Zhongshan City from January 2018 to April 2020 (Case group) as well as 64 healthy controls (Control group) from the same region were involved. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of DNMT1 genes (r s2114724 and rs 2228611) and DNMT3B genes (rs 2424932, rs 1569686, rs 6119954 and rs 2424908) were determined with massARRAY. Linkage disequilibrium analysis and haplotype analysis were performed, and genotype and allele frequencies were compared. The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was tested by the Chi-square test in SPSS software (version 20.0, SPSS Inc., USA). The severity of clinical symptoms was assessed by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). The correlation between DNMT1 genes (rs 2114724 and rs 2228611) and DNMT3B genes (rs2424932, rs1569686, rs6119954 and rs2424908) and clinical features was analyzed.There were no significant differences in genotype, allele frequency and haplotype of DNMT1 genes (rs 2114724 and rs 2228611) and DNMT3B genes (rs 2424932, rs 1569686, rs 6119954 and rs 2424908) between the case and healthy control group. There were significant differences in the PANSS total positive symptom scores, P3 (hallucinatory behavior), P6 (suspicious/persecution), G7 (motor retardation), and G15 (preoccupation) in patients with different DNMT1 gene rs 2114724 and rs 2228611 genotypes. The linkage disequilibrium analysis of gene polymorphic loci revealed that rs 2114724-rs 2228611 was complete linkage disequilibrium, and rs 1569686-rs 2424908, rs 2424932-rs 1569696 and rs 2424932-rs 2424908 were strongly linkage disequilibrium.The polymorphisms alteration in genetic pathway may be associated with development of specific clinical features in schizophrenia.© 2023.

Therefore, it is crucial to establish accurate and affordable markers that allow an individualized approach to GBM patients. Serum biomarkers could be the most accessible, as complete blood counts should be performed on all GBM patients before undergoing any surgical and/or pharmacological treatment. However, their prognostic role is still unclear. Our study aims to assess the influence of various hematological markers of inflammation in predicting the outcome of GBM patients.We retrospectively analyzed all adult patients diagnosed with primary glioblastoma in the Neurosurgery Department of the Emergency Clinical County Hospital of Târgu Mureș, Romania, from January 2017 until December 2019. We aimed to discover whether the immune/inflammatory status of the patients before receiving any kind of pharmacological or surgical treatment influenced their overall survival.Our study showed that pre-therapeutic elevated white blood count could predict reduced overall survival in not otherwise specified subtype (NOS) of GBMs (HR 0.4153, 95% CI 0.1825-0.9449, p 0.0362). Furthermore, patients with increased systemic immune response index (SIRI) had much larger tumors at the time of diagnosis (p 0.0359). In wild type, isocitrate dehydrogenase subpopulation (IDHwt), the higher values of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR, p 0.0412), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR, p 0.0376) and monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR, p 0.0412) were related to more advanced age at the moment of diagnosis. Moreover, our results revealed a weakly positive association between tumor size and NLR values in the NOS group (Spearman r 0.3212, p 0.0493).Our study does not provide enough evidence for the immune/inflammatory status of GBM patients to be used as an efficient prognostic marker to guide the therapeutic approach.Copyright © 2023, Serban et al."

"649",37670505,"Multi-omics regulatory network inference in the presence of missing data.","Brief Bioinform","A key problem in systems biology is the discovery of regulatory mechanisms that drive phenotypic behaviour of complex biological systems in the form of multi-level networks. Modern multi-omics profiling techniques probe these fundamental regulatory networks but are often hampered by experimental restrictions leading to missing data or partially measured omics types for subsets of individuals due to cost restrictions. In such scenarios, in which missing data is present, classical computational approaches to infer regulatory networks are limited. In recent years, approaches have been proposed to infer sparse regression models in the presence of missing information. Nevertheless, these methods have not been adopted for regulatory network inference yet. In this study, we integrated regression-based methods that can handle missingness into KiMONo, a Knowledge guided Multi-Omics Network inference approach, and benchmarked their performance on commonly encountered missing data scenarios in single- and multi-omics studies. Overall, two-step approaches that explicitly handle missingness performed best for a wide range of random- and block-missingness scenarios on imbalanced omics-layers dimensions, while methods implicitly handling missingness performed best on balanced omics-layers dimensions. Our results show that robust multi-omics network inference in the presence of missing data with KiMONo is feasible and thus allows users to leverage available multi-omics data to its full extent.© The Author(s) 2023.

Novel approaches are desperately needed to help address this immense public health issue. Data suggests that early intervention at the first stages of mild cognitive impairment may have a greater chance for success. The calcineurin (CN)-Pin1 signaling cascade can be selectively targeted with tacrolimus (FK506), a highly specific, FDA-approved CN inhibitor used safely for > 20 years in solid organ transplant recipients. AD prevalence was significantly reduced in solid organ recipients treated with FK506.Time release pellets were used to deliver constant FK506 dosage to APP/PS1 mice without deleterious manipulation or handling. Immunofluorescence, histology, molecular biology, and behavior were used to evaluate changes in AD pathology.FK506 can be safely and consistently delivered into juvenile APP/PS1 mice via time-release pellets to levels roughly seen in transplant patients, leading to the normalization of CN activity and reduction or elimination of AD pathologies including synapse loss, neuroinflammation, and cognitive impairment. Pin1 activity and function were rescued despite the continuing presence of high levels of transgenic Aβ42. Indicators of neuroinflammation including Iba1 positivity and IL-6 production were also reduced to normal levels. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained during treatment or splenocytes isolated at euthanasia activated normally after mitogens.Low-dose, constant FK506 can normalize CNS CN and Pin1 activity, suppress neuroinflammation, and attenuate AD-associated pathology without blocking peripheral IL-2 responses making repurposed FK506 a viable option for early, therapeutic intervention in AD.© 2023.

In addition, we estimated the impact of somatic mutations on the human prion protein (PrP) using PolyPhen-2, PANTHER and PROVEAN. Furthermore, we evaluated the 3D structure and electrostatic potential of the human PrP according to somatic mutations using DeepView. The rates ofPRNPK200 somatic mutation were significantly increased in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of sporadic CJD patients compared to the matched controls.

Here, we generate a panel of 107 fetal-like iPSC-derived pancreatic progenitor cells (iPSC-PPCs) from whole genome-sequenced individuals and identify 4065 genes and 4016 isoforms whose expression and/or alternative splicing are affected by regulatory variation. We integrate eQTLs identified in adult islets and whole pancreas samples, which reveal 1805 eQTL associations that are unique to the fetal-like iPSC-PPCs and 1043 eQTLs that exhibit regulatory plasticity across the fetal-like and adult pancreas tissues. Colocalization with GWAS risk loci for pancreatic diseases and traits show that some putative causal regulatory variants are active only in the fetal-like iPSC-PPCs and likely influence disease by modulating expression of disease-associated genes in early development, while others with regulatory plasticity likely exert their effects in both the fetal and adult pancreas by modulating expression of different disease genes in the two developmental stages.© 2023.

Here, we aimed to advance understanding of epigenetic regulation following innate immune activation, acutely and in endotoxin tolerant states.We exposed human primary monocytes from healthy donors (n = 6) to interferon-γ or differing combinations of endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide), including acute response (2 h) and two models of endotoxin tolerance: repeated stimulations (6 + 6 h) and prolonged exposure to endotoxin (24 h). Another subset of monocytes was left untreated (naïve). We identified context-specific regulatory elements based on epigenetic signatures for chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) and regulatory non-coding RNAs from total RNA sequencing.We present an atlas of differential gene expression for endotoxin and interferon response, identifying widespread context specific changes. Across assayed states, only 24-29% of genes showing differential exon usage are also differential at the gene level. Overall, 19.9% (6,884 of 34,616) of repeatedly observed ATAC peaks were differential in at least one condition, the majority upregulated on stimulation and located in distal regions (64.1% vs 45.9% of non-differential peaks) within which sequences were less conserved than non-differential peaks. We identified enhancer-derived RNA signatures specific to different monocyte states that correlated with chromatin accessibility changes. The endotoxin tolerance models showed distinct chromatin accessibility and transcriptomic signatures, with integrated analysis identifying genes and pathways involved in the inflammatory response, detoxification, metabolism and wound healing. We leveraged eQTL mapping for the same monocyte activation states to link potential enhancers with specific genes, identifying 1,946 unique differential ATAC peaks with 1,340 expression associated genes. We further use this to inform understanding of reported GWAS, for example involving FCHO1 and coronary artery disease.This study reports context-specific regulatory elements based on transcriptomic profiling and epigenetic signatures for enhancer-derived RNAs and chromatin accessibility in immune tolerant monocyte states, and demonstrates the informativeness of linking such elements and eQTL to inform future mechanistic studies aimed at defining therapeutic targets of immunosuppression and diseases.© 2023.

Early detection offers the best chance for curative treatment and reducing its mortality. However, the optimal population-based early screening for GC remains unmet. Aberrant DNA methylation occurs in the early stage of GC, exhibiting cancer-specific genetic and epigenetic changes, and can be detected in the media such as blood, gastric juice, and feces, constituting a valuable biomarker for cancer early detection. Furthermore, DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic alteration, and many innovative methods have been developed to quantify it rapidly and accurately. Nonetheless, large-scale clinical validation of DNA methylation serving as tumor biomarkers is still lacking, precluding their implementation in clinical practice. In conclusion, after a critical analysis of the recent existing literature, we summarized the evolving roles of DNA methylation during GC occurrence, expounded the newly discovered noninvasive DNA methylation biomarkers for early detection of GC, and discussed its challenges and prospects in clinical applications.© 2023 The Authors.

However, it is unclear whether the distinct disorder-specific mechanisms operate during adolescence despite the overlap among disorders.We studied a large cohort of more than 11 000 preadolescent (age 9-10 yr) children from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development cohort. We adopted a regrouping approach to compare cortical thickness (CT) alterations and longitudinal changes between healthy controls (n= 4041) and externalizing (n= 1182), internalizing (n= 1959) and thought disorder (n= 347) groups. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed on regional CT across 4468 unrelated European youth.Youth with externalizing or internalizing disorders exhibited increased regional CT compared with controls. Externalizing (p= 8 × 10-4, Cohend= 0.10) and internalizing disorders (p= 2 × 10-3, Cohend= 0.08) shared thicker CT in the left pars opercularis. The somatosensory and the primary auditory cortex were uniquely affected in externalizing disorders, whereas the primary motor cortex and higher-order visual association areas were uniquely affected in internalizing disorders. Only youth with externalizing disorders showed decelerated cortical thinning from age 10-12 years. The GWAS found 59 genome-wide significant associated genetic variants across these regions. Cortical thickness in common regions was associated with glutamatergic neurons, while internalizing-specific regional CT was associated with astrocytes, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and GABAergic neurons.The sample size of the GWAS was relatively small.Our study provides strong evidence for the presence of specificity in CT, developmental trajectories and underlying genetic underpinnings among externalizing and internalizing disorders during early adolescence.

"656",37680967,NA,NA,"Identifying biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease with a goal of early detection is a fundamental problem in clinical research. Both medical imaging and genetics have contributed informative biomarkers in literature. To further improve the performance, recently, there is an increasing interest in developing analytic approaches that combine data across modalities such as imaging and genetics. However, there are limited methods in literature that are able to systematically combine high-dimensional voxel-level imaging and genetic data for accurate prediction of clinical outcomes of interest. Existing prediction models that integrate imaging and genetic features often use region level imaging summaries, and they typically do not consider the spatial configurations of the voxels in the image or incorporate the dependence between genes that may compromise prediction ability. We propose a novel integrative Bayesian scalar-on-image regression model for predicting cognitive outcomes based on high-dimensional spatially distributed voxel-level imaging data, along with correlated transcriptomic features. We account for the spatial dependencies in the imaging voxels via a tensor approach that also enables massive dimension reduction to address the curse of dimensionality, and models the dependencies between the transcriptomic features via a Graph-Laplacian prior. We implement this approach via an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computation strategy. We apply the proposed method to the analysis of longitudinal ADNI data for predicting cognitive scores at different visits by integrating voxel-level cortical thickness measurements derived from T1w-MRI scans and transcriptomics data. We illustrate that the proposed imaging transcriptomics approach has significant improvements in prediction compared to prediction using a subset of features from only one modality (imaging or genetics), as well as when using imaging and transcriptomics features but ignoring the inherent dependencies between the features. Our analysis is one of the first to conclusively demonstrate the advantages of prediction based on combining voxel-level cortical thickness measurements along with transcriptomics features, while accounting for inherent structural information.Copyright © 2023 Liu, Chakraborty, Qin, Kundu and for the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative."

A ceRNA network was subsequently constructed. Differentially methylated genes were screened using the GSE62336 dataset. The abnormally expressed genes regulated by both the ceRNA network and DNA methylation were identified. In the ceRNA network, the expression of RP11-545G3.1 lncRNA was validated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma tissues and cells by RT-qPCR. After a knockdown of RP11-545G3.1, the viability, migration, and invasion of CNE-2 and NP69 cells was assessed by CCK-8, wound healing and Transwell assays.This study identified abnormally expressed mRNAs, miRNAs and lncRNAs in nasopharyngeal carcinoma tissues. A ceRNA network was constructed, which contained three lncRNAs, 15 miRNAs and 129 mRNAs. Among the nodes in the PPI network based on the mRNAs in the ceRNA network, HMGA1 was assessed in relation to the overall and disease-free survival of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. We screened two up-regulated genes regulated by the ceRNA network and hypomethylation and 26 down-regulated genes regulated by the ceRNA network and hypermethylation. RP11-545G3.1 was highly expressed in the nasopharyngeal carcinoma tissues and cells.

"658",37891246,NA,NA,"Psychiatric disorders show high co-morbidity, including co-morbid expressions of subclinical psychopathology across multiple disease spectra. Given the limitations of classical case-control designs in elucidating this overlap, new approaches are needed to identify biological underpinnings of spectra and their interaction. We assessed autistic-like traits (using the Autism Quotient, AQ) and schizotypy - as models of subclinical expressions of disease phenotypes and examined their association with volumes and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) of anterior, mid- and posterior hippocampus segments from  structural MRI scans in 318 and arterial spin labelling (ASL) in 346 nonclinical subjects, which overlapped with the structural imaging sample (N = 298). We demonstrate significant interactive effects of positive schizotypy and AQ social skills as well as of positive schizotypy and AQ imagination on hippocampal subfield volume variation. Moreover, we show that AQ attention switching modulated hippocampal head rCBF, while positive schizotypy by AQ attention to detail interactions modulated hippocampal tail rCBF. In addition, we show significant correlation of hippocampal volume and rCBF in both region-of-interest and voxel-wise analyses, which were robust after removal of variance related to schizotypy and autistic traits. These findings provide empirical evidence for both the modulation of hippocampal subfield structure and function through subclinical traits, and in particular how only the interaction of phenotype facets leads to significant reductions or variations in these parameters. This makes a case for considering the synergistic impact of different (subclinical) disease spectra on transdiagnostic biological parameters in psychiatry.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"659",37821906,"Single-cell sequencing technology applied to epigenetics for the study of tumor heterogeneity.","Clin Epigenetics","Previous studies have traditionally attributed the initiation of cancer cells to genetic mutations, considering them as the fundamental drivers of carcinogenesis. However, recent research has shed light on the crucial role of epigenomic alterations in various cell types present within the tumor microenvironment, suggesting their potential contribution to tumor formation and progression. Despite these significant findings, the progress in understanding the epigenetic mechanisms regulating tumor heterogeneity has been impeded over the past few years due to the lack of appropriate technical tools and methodologies.The emergence of single-cell sequencing has enhanced our understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms governing tumor heterogeneity by revealing the distinct epigenetic layers of individual cells (chromatin accessibility, DNA/RNA methylation, histone modifications, nucleosome localization) and the diverse omics (transcriptomics, genomics, multi-omics) at the single-cell level. These technologies provide us with new insights into the molecular basis of intratumoral heterogeneity and help uncover key molecular events and driving mechanisms in tumor development.This paper provides a comprehensive review of the emerging analytical and experimental approaches of single-cell sequencing in various omics, focusing specifically on epigenomics. These approaches have the potential to capture and integrate multiple dimensions of individual cancer cells, thereby revealing tumor heterogeneity and epigenetic features. Additionally, this paper outlines the future trends of these technologies and their current technical limitations.© 2023. BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature."

But there is still a lack of understanding regarding its pathogenesis. Thus, this study aimed to identify potential hub genes and their important pathways and pathological mechanisms of interactions between IBD and BC using bioinformatics methods.The data from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) were analyzed to screen common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between IBD and BC. The ""clusterProfiler"" package was used to analyze GO term and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment in DEGs. After that, we conducted a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) on these DEGs to determine the vital modules and genes significantly related to BC. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks was used to identify hub genes. Further, the hub genes were used to develop a prognostic signature by Cox analysis. The validity of the ten hub DEGs was tested using three classification algorithms. Finally, we analyzed the microRNAs (miRNA)-mRNA, transcription factors (TFs)-mRNA regulatory network.Positive regulation of organelle fission, chromosomal region, tubulin binding, and cell cycle signaling pathway were the major enriched pathways for the common DEGs. PPI networks identified three hub proteins (AURKB, CDK1, and CCNA2) with high connectivity. Three machine-learning classification algorithms based on ten hub genes performed well for IBD and BC (accuracy > 0.80). The robust predictive model based on the ten hub genes could accurately classify BC cases with various clinical outcomes. Based on the gene-TFs and gene-miRNAs network construction, 9 TFs and 6 miRNAs were identified as potential critical TFs and miRNAs. There are 13 drugs that interact with the hub gene based on gene-drug interaction analysis.This study explored common gene signatures and the potential pathogenesis of IBD and BC. We revealed that an unbalanced immune response, cell cycle pathway, and neutrophil infiltration might be the common pathogenesis of IBD and BC. Molecular mechanisms for the treatment of IBD and CC still require further investigation.© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."
"661",37828407,NA,NA,"Currently, most men with infertility cannot be given an aetiology, which reflects a lack of knowledge around gamete production and how it is affected by genetics and the environment. A failure to recognize the burden of male infertility and its potential as a biomarker for systemic illness exists. The absence of such knowledge results in patients generally being treated as a uniform group, for whom the strategy is to bypass the causality using medically assisted reproduction (MAR) techniques. In doing so, opportunities to prevent co-morbidity are missed and the burden of MAR is shifted to the woman. To advance understanding of men's reproductive health, longitudinal and multi-national centres for data and sample collection are essential. Such programmes must enable an integrated view of the consequences of genetics, epigenetics and environmental factors on fertility and offspring health. Definition and possible amelioration of the consequences of MAR for conceived children are needed. Inherent in this statement is the necessity to promote fertility restoration and/or use the least invasive MAR strategy available. To achieve this aim, protocols must be rigorously tested and the move towards personalized medicine encouraged. Equally, education of the public, governments and clinicians on the frequency and consequences of infertility is needed. Health options, including male contraceptives, must be expanded, and the opportunities encompassed in such investment understood. The pressing questions related to male reproductive health, spanning the spectrum of andrology are identified in the Expert Recommendation.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."

However, the impact of single-cell-based Cuproptosis-associated lncRNAs on the Tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) of Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) and its potential value for individualized immunotherapy has not been clarified.14 immune-related CRGs were screened by exploring the interaction between differentially expressed Immune-Related Genes (IRGs) and Cuproptosis-Related Genes (CRGs) in PAAD. Next, the expression amount and expression distribution of CRGs in single-cell samples were analyzed by focusing on 7-CRGs with significant expressions. On the one hand, MAP2K2, SOD1, and VEGFA, which were significantly differentially expressed between PAAD sites and normal tissues adjacent to them, were subjected to immunohistochemical validation and immune landscape analysis. On the other hand, from these 7-CRGs, prognostic signatures of lncRNAs were established by co-expression and LASSO-COX regression analysis, and their prognostic value and immune relevance were assessed. In addition, this study not only validated the hub CRGs and the lncRNAs constituting the signature in a PAAD animal model treated with immunotherapy-based combination therapy using immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR but also explored the potential value of the combination of targeted, chemotherapy and immunotherapy.Based on the screening of 7-CRGs significantly expressed in a PAAD single-cell cohort and their co-expressed Cuproptosis-Related lncRNAs (CRIs), this study constructed a prognostic signature of 4-CRIs named CIR-score. A Nomogram integrating the CIR-score and clinical risk factors was constructed on this basis to predict the individualized survival of patients. Moreover, high and low-risk groups classified according to the median of signatures exhibited significant differences in clinical prognosis, immune landscape, bioenrichment, tumor burden, and drug sensitivity. And the immunohistochemical and qRT-PCR results of different mouse PAAD treatment strategies were consistent with the trend of inter-group variability in drug sensitivity of hub CRGs and CIR-score. The combination of immunotherapy, targeted therapy, and chemotherapy exhibited a better tumor suppression effect.CIR-score, as a Cuproptosis-related TIME-specific prognostic signature based on PAAD single cells, not only predicts the prognosis and immune landscape of PAAD patients but also provides a new strategy for individualized immunotherapy-based combination therapy.Copyright © 2023 Sun, Yao, Man, Gao, He and Fan."

Increasing evidence highlights the significant role of immune-related genes (IRGs) in ACC progression and immunotherapy, but the research is still limited. Based on the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, immune-related molecular subtypes were identified by unsupervised consensus clustering. Univariate Cox analysis and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression were employed to further establish immune-related gene signatures (IRGS). An evaluation of immune cell infiltration, biological function, tumor mutation burden (TMB), predicted immunotherapy response, and drug sensitivity in ACC patients was conducted to elucidate the applicative efficacy of IRGS in precision therapy. ACC patients were divided into two molecular subtypes through consistent clustering. Furthermore, the 3-gene signature (including PRKCA, LTBP1, and BIRC5) based on two molecular subtypes demonstrated consistent prognostic efficacy across the TCGA and GEO datasets and emerged as an independent prognostic factor. The low-risk group exhibited heightened immune cell infiltration, TMB, and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), associated with a favorable prognosis. Pathways associated with drug metabolism, hormone regulation, and metabolism were activated in the low-risk group. In conclusion, our findings suggest IRGS can be used as an independent prognostic biomarker, providing a foundation for shaping future ACC immunotherapy strategies."

Timely, appropriate therapy may improve clinical outcomes, and therefore, determining which patients benefit from more comprehensive diagnostic strategies (i.e., direct specimen testing) could be of value. We performed an assessment of procalcitonin (PCT) and clinical characteristics in the discrimination of bacteremic hospitalizations. We analyzed 71,105 encounters and 14,846 visits of patients with bacteremia alongside 56,259 without an admission. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic (AUROC) curve for the prediction of bacteremia via procalcitonin was 0.782 (95% CI 0.779-0.787). The prediction modeling of clinical factors with or without PCT resulted in a similar performance to PCT alone. However, the clinically predicted risk of bacteremia stratified by PCT thresholds allowed the targeting of high-incidence bacteremia groups (e.g., ≥50% positivity). The combined use of PCT and clinical characteristics could be useful in diagnostic stewardship by targeting further advanced diagnostic testing in patients with a high predicted probability of bacteremia."

The customization of specialized prognostication approaches and the exploration of supplementary treatment options hold critical clinical implications in relation to the inflammatory response.In the present study, unsupervised clustering was implemented on TCGA-KIRC tumors using transcriptome profiles of inflammatory response genes, which was then validated in two ccRCC datasets (E-MATB-1980 and ICGC) and two immunotherapy datasets (IMvigor210 and Liu et al.) via SubMap and NTP algorithms. Combining co-expression and LASSO analyses, inflammatory response-based scoring system was defined, which was evaluated in pan-cancer.Three reproducible inflammatory response subtypes (named IR1, IR2 and IR3) were determined and independently verified, each exhibiting distinct molecular, clinical, and immunological characteristics. Among these subtypes, IR2 had the best OS outcomes, followed by IR3 and IR1. In terms of anti-angiogenic agents, sunitinib may be appropriate for IR1 patients, while axitinib and pazopanib may be suitable for IR2 patients, and sorafenib for IR3 patients. Additionally, IR1 patients might benefit from anti-CTLA4 therapy. A scoring system called IRscore was defined for individual ccRCC patients. Patients with high IRscore presented a lower response rate to anti-PD-L1 therapy and worse prognostic outcomes. Pan-cancer analysis demonstrated the immunological features and prognostic relevance of the IRscore.Altogether, characterization of inflammatory response subtypes and IRscore provides a roadmap for patient risk stratification and personalized treatment decisions, not only in ccRCC, but also in pan-cancer.© 2023.

The prognosis of patients with advanced HGSOC requires prediction by genetic markers. This study systematically analyzed gene expression profile data to establish a genetic marker for predicting HGSOC prognosis.The RNA-seq data set and information on clinical follow-up of HGSOC were retrieved from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and the data were standardized by DESeq2 as a training set. On the other hand, HGSOC RNA sequence data and information on clinical follow-up were retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) as a test set. Additionally, ovarian cancer microarray data set was obtained from GEO as the external validation set. Prognostic genes were screened from the training set, and characteristic selection was performed using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) with 80% re-sampling for 5000 times. Genes with a frequency of more than 2000 were selected as robust biomarkers. Finally, a gene-related prognostic model was validated in both the test and GEO validation sets.A total of 148 genes were found to be significantly correlated with HGSOC prognosis. The expression profile of these genes could stratify HGSOC prognosis and they were enriched to multiple tumor-related regulatory pathways such as tyrosine metabolism and AMPK signaling pathway. AKR1B10 and ANGPT4 were obtained after 5000-time re-sampling by LASSO regression. AKR1B10 was associated with the metastasis and progression of several tumors. In this study, Cox regression analysis was performed to create a 2-gene signature as an independent prognostic factor for HGSOC, which has the ability to stratify risk samples in all three data sets (p < 0.05). The Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) discovered abnormally active REGULATION_OF_AUTOPHAGY and OLFACTORY_TRANSDUCTION pathways in the high-risk group samples.This study resulted in the creation of a 2-gene molecular prognostic classifier that distinguished clinical features and was a promising novel prognostic tool for assessing the prognosis of HGSOC. RiskScore was a novel prognostic model which might be effective in guiding accurate prognosis of HGSOC.© 2023. The Author(s)."

However, the role of P2RY6 in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains unknown.We used transcriptomic, genomic, single-cell transcriptomic, and methylation sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas database to analyze the aberrant status and prognostic value of P2RY6 in a variety of tumors. The LUAD single-cell sequencing dataset was used to explore the effect of P2RY6 on the tumor microenvironment. Cell-type identification by estimating relative subsets of RNA transcripts (CIBERSORT) was used to quantify immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. We also analyzed the correlation of P2RY6 with immune checkpoints and immune regulation-related genes. The correlation of between tumor mutation burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), and P2RY6 expression was also analyzed simultaneously. Tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry were employed to assess the expression of P2RY6 in internal tumor samples.Our findings indicate that P2RY6 exhibits significantly higher expression levels in various cancer tissues, particularly in LUAD. High expression of P2RY6 was closely associated with a poor prognosis for patients, and it plays a role in regulating immune-related pathways, such as cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction. Notably, P2RY6 expression is closely linked to the abundance of CD8 + T cells. Furthermore, we have developed a P2RY6-related inflammation prediction model that demonstrates promising results in predicting the prognosis of LUAD patients, with an AUC (area under the curve) value of 0.83. This performance is significantly better than the traditional TNM staging system. Through single-cell transcriptome sequencing analysis, we observed that high P2RY6 expression is associated with increased intercellular communication. Additionally, pathway enrichment analysis revealed that P2RY6 influences antigen presentation and processing pathways within the LUAD microenvironment.This study suggests that P2RY6 would be a new target for immunotherapy in LUAD.© 2023.

Predictive models that use questionnaire-based factors such as diet, supplement use, recency of blood donation, and medical conditions could potentially provide a noninvasive alternative for studying health effects associated with iron status. We hypothesized that a model based on questionnaire data could predict blood-based measures of iron status biomarkers. Using iron (mcg/dL), ferritin (mcg/dL), and transferrin saturation (%) based on blood collected at study entry, in a subsample from the U.S.-wide Sister Study (n = 3171), we developed and validated a prediction model for iron with multivariable linear regression models. Model performance based on these cross-sectional data was weak, with R2less than 0.10 for serum iron and transferrin saturation, but better for ferritin, with an R2of 0.13 in premenopausal women and 0.19 in postmenopausal women. When menopause was included in the predictive model for the sample, the R2was 0.31 for ferritin. Internal validation of the estimates indicated some optimism present in the observed prediction model, implying there would be worse performance when applied to new samples from the same population. Serum iron status is hard to assess based only on questionnaire data. Reducing measurement error in both the exposure and outcome may improve the prediction model performance, but environmental heterogeneity, temporal variation, and genetic heterogeneity in absorption and storage may contribute substantially to iron status.© 2023.

The basement membrane (BM) is critical for establishing and maintaining cell polarity, adult function, embryonic and organ morphogenesis, and many other biological processes. Some basement membrane protein genes have been proven to be prognostic biomarkers for various cancers. This research aimed to develop a novel risk assessment system based on BMRGs that would serve as a theoretical foundation for tailored and accurate treatment.Methods:We used gene expression profiles and clinical data from the TCGA-UVM cohort of 80 UVM patients as a training set. 56 UVM patients from the combined cohort of GSE84976 and GSE22138 were employed as an external validation dataset. Prognostic characteristics of basement membrane protein-related genes (BMRGs) were characterized by Lasso, stepwise multifactorial Cox. Multivariate analysis revealed BMRGs to be independent predictors of UVM. The TISCH database probes the crosstalk of BMEGs in the tumor microenvironment at the single-cell level. Finally, we investigated the function of ITGA5 in UVM using multiple experimental techniques, including CCK8, transwell, wound healing assay, and colony formation assay.Results:There are three genes in the prognostic risk model (ADAMTS10, ADAMTS14, and ITGA5). After validation, we determined that the model is quite reliable and accurately forecasts the prognosis of UVM patients. Immunotherapy is more likely to be beneficial for UVM patients in the high-risk group, whereas the survival advantage may be greater for UVM patients in the low-risk group. Knockdown of ITGA5 expression was shown to inhibit the proliferation, migration, and invasive ability of UVM cells in vitro experiments.Conclusion:The 3-BMRGs feature model we constructed has excellent predictive performance which plays a key role in the prognosis, informing the individualized treatment of UVM patients. It also provides a new perspective for assessing pre-immune efficacy.Copyright © 2023 Li, Cai, Yang, Xie, Pei, Wu, Zhang, Song, Zhang, Zhang, Chi and Yang."

However, the potential implications of 5-methylcytosine (m5C) in soft tissue sarcoma (STS) are unclear.The RNA sequence profile of 911 normal and 259 primary STS tissues were obtained from GTEx and TCGA databases, respectively. We systematically analyzed the m5C modification patterns of STS samples based on 11 m5C regulators, and comprehensively correlated these modification patterns with clinical characteristics, prognosis, and tumor microenvironment (TME) cell-infiltrating. Furthermore, an m5C-related signature was generated using Cox proportional hazard model and validated by the GSE17118 cohort.Two distinct m5C modification patterns (cluster1/2) were discovered. The cluster1 had favorable overall survival, higher immune score, higher expression of most immune checkpoints, and active immune cell infiltration. The GSVA analysis of the P53 pathway, Wnt signaling pathway, G2M checkpoint, mTORC1 signaling, Wnt/β catenin signaling, and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling were significantly enriched in the cluster2. Moreover, 1220 genes were differentially expressed between two clusters, and a m5C prognostic signature was constructed with five m5C-related genes. The signature represented an independent prognostic factor and showed the favorable performance in the GSE17118 cohort. Patients in the low-risk group showed higher immunoscore and higher expression of most immune checkpoints. Further GSVA analysis indicated that the levels of P53 pathway, Wnt signaling pathway, and TGF-β signaling pathway were different between low- and high-risk groups. Moreover, a nomogram incorporating m5C signature and clinical variables was established and showed well performance.This work showed that the m5C modification plays a significant role in the progression of STS and the formation of TME diversity. Evaluating the m5C modification pattern of tumor will enhance our cognition of TME infiltration characterization to guide more effective immunotherapy strategies.© 2023 The Authors."

PMRGs are not known to be involved in Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).In this study, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases were accessed for HCC-related transcriptome data and clinical information. First, DE-PMRGs were derived by intersecting PMRGs and DEGs between HCC tissues and normal controls. The clusterProfiler R package was then used to enrich DE-PMRGs. In addition, biomarkers of HCC were identified, and a prognostic model was developed. Using functional analysis and tumor microenvironment analysis, new insights were obtained into HCC. The expression of biomarkers was validated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).132 DE-PMRGs were obtained by intersecting 3690 DEGs and 291 PMRGs. Steroid and organic acid metabolism were associated with these genes. For the construction of the risk model for HCC samples, five biomarkers were identified, including Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase short chain (ACADS), CYP19A1, formiminotransferase cyclodeaminase (FTCD), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), and glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT2). ACADS, FTCD, and GOT2 were positive factors, whereas CYP19A1 and G6PD were negative. HCC patients with AUC greater than 0.6 were predicted to survive 1/2/3/4/5 years, indicating decent efficiency of the model. The probability of 1/3/5-survival for HCC was also predicted by the nomogram using the risk score, pathologic T stage, and cancer status. Moreover, functional enrichment analysis revealed the high-risk genes were associated with invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Significantly, immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint expression were linked to HCC development.This study identified five biomarkers of propionate metabolism that can predict HCC prognosis. This finding may provide a deeper understanding of PMRG function in HCC.© 2023 Xiao et al."

Differently expressed ion channel-related genes (DEICRGs) enrichment analyses were performed. We utilized the protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis and machine learning of LASSO and support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) to identify the target genes. Based on these target genes, a nomogram diagnostic model was constructed and verified by a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Moreover, immune infiltration analysis, single-gene gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and gene set variation analysis (GSVA) were executed. Finally, a drug-gene interaction network was constructed.Results:We identified 29 DEICRGs, and enrichment analyses indicated they were primarily enriched in ion transport, cellular ion homeostasis, pancreatic secretion, and lysosome. Moreover, the PPI network and machine learning recognized three target genes (MCOLN1,ATP6V0E1, andATP4A). Based on these target genes, we constructed an efficiently predictable diagnosis model for identifying insulinomas with a nomogram and validated it with the ROC curve (AUC = 0.801, 95% CI 0.674-0.898). Then, single-gene GSEA analysis revealed that these target genes had a significantly positive correlation with insulin secretion and lysosome. In contrast, the TGF-beta signaling pathway was negatively associated with them. Furthermore, statistically significant discrepancies in immune infiltration were revealed.Conclusion:We identified three ion channel-related genes and constructed an efficiently predictable diagnosis model to offer a novel approach for diagnosing insulinoma.Copyright © 2023 Mo, Wang, Wu, Zhao, Jiang and Qin."

Copper ion accumulation was elevated in HCC tissue samples. Copper homeostasis is implicated in cancer cell proliferation and angiogenesis. The potential of copper homeostasis as a new theranostic biomarker for molecular imaging and the targeted therapy of HCC has been demonstrated. Recent studies have reported a novel copper-dependent nonapoptotic form of cell death called cuproptosis, strikingly different from other known forms of cell death. The correlation between cuproptosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not fully understood.The transcriptomic data of patients with HCC were retrieved from the Cancer Genome Atlas-Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma (TCGA-LIHC) and were used as a discovery cohort to construct the prognosis model. The gene expression data of patients with HCC retrieved from the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases were used as the validation cohort. The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression analysis was used to construct the prognosis model. A principal component analysis (PCA) was used to evaluate the overall characteristics of cuproptosis regulator genes and obtain the PC1 and PC2 scores. Unsupervised clustering was performed using the ConsensusClusterPlus R package to identify the molecular subtypes of HCC. Cox regression analysis was performed to identify cuproptosis regulator genes that could predict the prognosis of patients with HCC. The receiver operating characteristics curve and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were used to understand the role of hub genes in predicting the diagnosis and prognosis of patients, as well as the prognosis risk model. A weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used for screening the cuproptosis subtype-related hub genes. The functional enrichment analysis was performed using Metascape. The 'glmnet' R package was used to perform the LASSO regression analysis, and the randomForest algorithm was performed using the 'randomForest' R package. The 'pRRophetic' R package was used to estimate the anticancer drug sensitivity based on the data retrieved from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer database. The nomogram was constructed using the 'rms' R package. Pearson's correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlations.We constructed a six-gene signature prognosis model and a nomogram to predict the prognosis of patients with HCC. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that patients with a high-risk score, which was predicted by the six-gene signature model, had poor prognoses (log-rank testp< 0.001; HR = 1.83). The patients with HCC were grouped into three distinct cuproptosis subtypes (Cu-clusters A, B, and C) based on the expression pattern of cuproptosis regulator genes. The patients in Cu-cluster B had poor prognosis (log-rank testp< 0.001), high genomic instability, and were not sensitive to conventional chemotherapeutic treatment compared to the patients in the other subtypes. Cancer cells in Cu-cluster B exhibited a higher degree of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), a marker of cellular senescence. Three representative genes,CDCA8,MCM6, andNCAPG2, were identified in patients in Cu-cluster B using WGCNA and the ""randomForest"" algorithm. A nomogram was constructed to screen patients in the Cu-cluster B subtype based on three genes:CDCA8,MCM6, andNCAPG2.Publicly available databases and various bioinformatics tools were used to study the heterogeneity of cuproptosis in patients with HCC. Three HCC subtypes were identified, with differences in the survival outcomes, genomic instability, senescence environment, and response to anticancer drugs. Further, three cuproptosis-related genes were identified, which could be used to design personalized therapeutic strategies for HCC."

On the other hand, hub MAGs were obtained by a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Following the expression of hub MAGs, patients with LUAD were classified into two molecular subtypes. A comparison was made of the differences in half-maximal drug inhibitory concentration (IC50) and tumor mutational burden (TMB) between groups. In addition, the influence of MAGs on the anticancer efficacy of different therapies was explored. MAGs, which were included in both the prognosis signature and hub genes, were considered to have great value in prognosis and targeted therapy. They were identified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). A total of 154 differently expressed MAGs were discovered. For one thing, a microtubule-related prognostic signature based on 14 MAGs was created and identified in an external validation cohort. The prognostic signature was used as an independent prognostic factor. For another, 45 hub MAGs were obtained. In accordance with the expression profile of 45 MAGs, patients with LUAD were divided into two subtypes. Distinct differences were observed in TMB and IC50 values of popular chemotherapy and targeted drugs between subtypes. Finally, five genes were included in both the prognosis signature and hub genes, and identified by qRT-PCR. A microtubule-related prognosis signature that can serve as an independent prognostic factor was constructed. Microtubule subtype influenced the efficacy of different treatments and could be used to guide therapy selection. In this research, five key MAGs, including MYB proto-oncogene like 2 (MYBL2), nucleolar and spindle-associated protein 1 (NUSAP1), kinesin family member 4A (KIF4A), KIF15 and KIF20A, were verified and identified. They are promising biomarkers and therapeutic targets in LUAD.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."

However, characterization of cellular senescence-associated phenotypes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unexplored.To address this issue, we delineated cellular senescence landscape across HCC.We enrolled two HCC datasets, TCGA-LIHC and International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC). Unsupervised clustering was executed to probe tumor heterogeneity based upon cellular senescence genes. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithm were utilized to define a cellular senescence-relevant scoring system.TRNP1expression was measured in HCCs and normal tissues through immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The influence of TMF-regulated nuclear protein (TRNP)1 on HCC senescence and growth was provenviaa series of experiments.TCGA-LIHC patients were classified as three cellular senescence subtypes, named C1-3. The robustness and reproducibility of these subtypes were proven in the ICGC cohort. C2 had the worst overall survival, C1 the next, and C3 the best. C2 presented the highest levels of immune checkpoints, abundance of immune cells, and immunogenetic indicators. Thus, C2 might possibly respond to immunotherapy. C2 had the lowest somatic mutation rate, while C1 presented the highest copy number variations. A cellular senescence-relevant gene signature was generated, which can predict patient survival, and chemo- or immunotherapeutic response. Experimentally, it was proven that TRNP1 presented the remarkable upregulation in HCCs. TRNP1 knockdown induced apoptosis and senescence of HCC cells and attenuated tumor growth.These findings provide a systematic framework for assessing cellular senescence in HCC, which decode the tumor heterogeneity and tailor the pharmacological interventions to improve clinical management.©The Author(s) 2023.

The elevated risk of osteoporotic fracture in elderly women poses a substantial burden on individuals and society. Unfortunately, the current lack of dependable diagnostic markers and precise therapeutic targets for PMOP remains a major challenge.PMOP-related datasets GSE7429, GSE56814, GSE56815, and GSE147287, were downloaded from the GEO database. The DEGs were identified by ""limma"" packages. WGCNA and Machine Learning were used to choose key module genes highly related to PMOP. GSEA, DO, GO, and KEGG enrichment analysis was performed on all DEGs and the selected key hub genes. The PPI network was constructed through the GeneMANIA database. ROC curves and AUC values validated the diagnostic values of the hub genes in both training and validation datasets. xCell immune infiltration and single-cell analysis identified the hub genes' function on immune reaction in PMOP. Pan-cancer analysis revealed the role of the hub genes in cancers.A total of 1278 DEGs were identified between PMOP patients and the healthy controls. The purple module and cyan module were selected as the key modules and 112 common genes were selected after combining the DEGs and module genes. Five Machine Learning algorithms screened three hub genes (KCNJ2, HIPK1, and ROCK1), and a PPI network was constructed for the hub genes. ROC curves validate the diagnostic values of ROCK1 in both the training (AUC = 0.73) and validation datasets of PMOP (AUC = 0.81). GSEA was performed for the low-ROCK1 patients, and the top enriched field included protein binding and immune reaction. DCs and NKT cells were highly expressed in PMOP. Pan-cancer analysis showed a correlation between low ROCK1 expression and SKCM as well as renal tumors (KIRP, KICH, and KIRC).ROCK1 was significantly associated with the pathogenesis and immune infiltration of PMOP, and influenced cancer development, progression, and prognosis, which provided a potential therapy target for PMOP and tumors. However, further laboratory and clinical evidence is required before the clinical application of ROCK1 as a therapeutic target."

Cuproptosis is a recently discovered form of regulated cell death. However, its significance in ESCC remains largely unknown. In this study, we observed significant expression differences in most of the 12 cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) in the TCGA-ESCC dataset, which was validated using GSE20347, GSE38129, and individual ESCC datasets. We were able to divide patients in the TCGA-ESCC cohort into two subgroups based on disease, and found significant differences in survivor outcomes and biological functions between these subgroups. Additionally, we identified 11 prognosis-related genes from the 12 CRGs using LASSO COX regression analysis and constructed a CRGs signature for ESCC. Patients were categorized into high- and low-risk subgroups based on their median risk score, with those in the high-risk subgroup having significantly worse overall survival than those in the low-risk subgroup. The CRGs signature was also highly accurate in predicting prognosis and survival outcomes. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses revealed that 8 of the 11 CRGs were independent prognostic factors for predicting survival in ESCC patients. Furthermore, our nomogram performed well and could serve as a useful tool for predicting prognosis. Finally, our risk model was found to be relevant to the sensitivity of targeted agents and immune infiltration. Functional enrichment analysis demonstrated that the risk model was associated with biological pathways of tumor migration and invasion. In summary, our study may provide a promising prognostic signature based on CRGs and offers potential targets for personalized therapy."

Then, TUNEL, H&E, Masson staining, immunohistochemical (IHC) and serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK), as well as the expression levels of CaSR and pyroptosis-related proteins in heart tissues, were measured. H9c2 cells were cultured to create a hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) model and exposed to different concentrations of RF. After pretreatment with the CaSR activator gadolinium chloride (GdCl3) and inhibitor NPS2143 in the H/R model and treatment with HRF, we compared cellular viability, TUNEL, cytosolic [Ca2+]i, the levels of LDH and CK, pyroptosis-related proteins and CaSR in H9c2 cells. We further researched the mechanisms of CaSR-mediated pyroptosis in the H/R+HRF model by CaSR-shRNA, Ac-YVAD-CMK, MCC950 and NAC.Results:We found that HRF significantly increased CaSR expression, rate of cell death, levels of CK and LDH, and exacerbated pyroptosis in MI/R model.In vitro, HRF increased CaSR expression, decreased viability, enhanced cytosolic [Ca2+]iand exacerbated pyroptosis in H/R cells.

Sixty-one patients with a median age of 67 years (range: 28-88 years) were recruited, and only 44 subjects were included for further analyses. Our investigation revealed 120 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between smokers and nonsmokers, with a fold change (FC) of ≥1.5 and ap-value < 0.05. Among these DEGs, 15 were upregulated and 105 were downregulated. Notably, when applying a more stringent adjusted FC ≥ 2.0, 31 DEGs (5 upregulated, annotated to immune response pathways, and 26 downregulated, involving oxygen and haem binding or activity, with FDR ≤ 0.03) remained statistically significant at an alpha level of <0.05. Our results illuminate the molecular mechanisms underlying CAD, fortifying existing epidemiological evidence. Of particular interest is the unexplored overexpression ofRCAN3,TRAV4, andJCHAINgenes, which may hold promising implications for the involvement of these genes in CAD among smokers."

However, in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients, the role of gene methylation in the development of CV disease is under-studied. We aimed to identify the CV disease-related DNA methylation loci in patients with T2D and to explore the potential pathways underlying the development of CV disease using a two-stage design.The participants were from the Jinan Diabetes Cohort Study (JNDCS), an ongoing longitudinal study designed to evaluate the development of CV risk in patients with T2D. In the discovery cohort, 10 diabetic patients with CV events at baseline were randomly selected as the case group, and another 10 diabetic patients without CV events were matched for sex, age, smoking status, and body mass index as the control group. In 1438 T2D patients without CV disease at baseline, 210 patients with CV events were identified after a mean 6.5-year follow-up. Of whom, 100 patients who experienced CV events during the follow-up were randomly selected as cases, and 100 patients who did not have CV events were randomly selected as the control group in the validation cohort. Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing and Targeted Bisulfite Sequencing were used to measure the methylation profiles in the discovery and validation cohort, respectively.In the discover cohort, 127 DMRs related to CV disease were identified in T2D patients. Further, we validated 23 DMRs mapped to 25 genes, of them, 4 genes (ARSG, PNPLA6, NEFL, and CRYGEP) for the first time were reported.

Linear and logistic regressions were used to estimate 3-month preconception and trimester-averaged air pollution exposure associations; and distributed lag models (DLM) were used to identify critical exposure windows at the weekly resolution from preconception to delivery. Two-pollutant models and children's sex-specific associations were explored.After controlling for covariates, one standard deviation (SD) (11.5 μg/m3, equivalent to 6.1 ppb) increase in NO2exposure during the second and the third trimester was associated with 13% (95% confidence interval: 2 - 26%) and 14% (95% CI: 1 - 29%) increase in SGA, respectively; and one SD (9.6 μg/m3) increase in PM2.5exposure during the third trimester was associated with 15% (95% CI: 1 - 31%) increase in SGA. No association have been found for outcomes of birthweight, birthweight Z-score and LGA. DLM found that gestational weeks 22-32 were a critical window, when NO2exposure had strongest associations with SGA. The associations of air pollution exposure tended to be stronger in female newborns than in male newborns. However, no significant associations of air pollution exposure during preconception period on birthweight outcomes were found.Consistent with previous studies, we found that air pollution exposure during mid-to-late pregnancy was associated with adverse birthweight outcomes.© 2023.

Relationships between MIR99AHG expression and immune cells infiltration were analyzed in Xiantao platform. In addition, co-expressed genes and interacting proteins of MIR99AHG were predicted. CancerSEA analyzed its relationship with functional states. Next, CNV status, DNA methylation, interacting transcription factors (TFs) and ceRNA network were analyzed to explore its possible mechanisms. Then, RNA ISH and FISH assays were used to detect its expression and location in BRCA tissues and cell lines, respectively. Finally, qRT-PCR was utilized to investigate MIR99AHG expression in cell lines.Compared with the corresponding normal tissues, MIR99AHG expression levels were lower in all BRCA subtypes, and luminal B's was the lowest one. And MIR99AHG expression was negatively related to the tumor stage. In addition, 4 transcripts (ENST00000619222.4, ENST00000418813.6, ENST00000602901.5 and ENST00000453910.5) of MIR99AHG showed significant differences in the expression. Databases also suggested that the high MIR99AHG expression levels indicated good prognosis, especially in patients without lymph node metastasis. Xiantao found that MIR99AHG was positively related to 17 immune cells and negatively linked with 2 immune cells. CancerSEA analysis showed no relationships between MIR99AHG and functional states. From GEPIA and BCIP databases, 19 co-expressed genes were highly related to these four significant transcripts of MIR99AHG. StarBase, RNAct and HDOCK showed that several tumor-associated proteins, including U2AF65, hnRNPC, AEBP2, CHIC1 and so on, might interact with MIR99AHG. Genetically, BRCA had a higher proportion of MIR99AHG CNV loss than CNV gain, and the high level of DNA methylation indicated a good prognosis. Furthermore, 19 TFs were predicted to combine with the promoter of MIR99AHG. Then, we screened out 10 miRNAs potentially interacting with the significant transcripts of MIR99AHG, and five were significantly increased in breast tumors compared to normal tissues, including miR-194-5p, miR-320 b and so on, which could combine 14 mRNAs. Through ISH and FISH assays, we verified that MIR99AHG was down-regulated in BRCA samples and cell lines in comparison to non-tumor tissues and mammary epithelial cell line (MCF10A), and MIR99AHG was located both in cytoplasm and nucleus. qRT-PCR assay also showed the lower expression of MIR99AHG in breast cancer cells than that in MCF10A.These results indicate that MIR99AHG can be a favorable prognostic indicator for BRCA. ENST00000619222.4, ENST00000418813.6, ENST00000602901.5 and ENST00000453910.5 are significant transcripts and their down-regulation may play crucial roles in the progression of BRCA.© 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd."

We report herein a mechanistic link between disrupted DNA methylation at PMDs and the spatial relocalization of H3K9me3-marked heterochromatin in aged hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) or those with impaired DNA methylation. We uncover that TET2 modulates the spatial redistribution of H3K9me3-marked heterochromatin to mediate the upregulation of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), hence contributing to functional decline of aged HSPCs. TET2-deficient HSPCs retain perinuclear distribution of heterochromatin and exhibit age-related clonal expansion. Reverse transcriptase inhibitors suppress ERVs and ISGs expression, thereby restoring age-related defects in aged HSPCs. Collectively, our findings deepen the understanding of the functional interplay between DNA methylation and histone modifications, which is vital for maintaining heterochromatin function and safeguarding genome stability in stem cells.© 2023.

Recent RNA-Seq data with large samples pose challenges to existing DGE methods, which were mainly developed for dichotomous traits and small sample sizes. Especially, existing DGE methods are likely to result in inflated false positive rates. To address this gap, we employed a linear mixed model (LMM) that has been widely used in genetic association studies for DGE analysis of quantitative traits. We first applied the LMM method to the discovery RNA-Seq data of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) tissue (n = 632) with four continuous measures of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) cognitive and neuropathologic traits. The quantile-quantile plots of p-values showed that false positive rates were well calibrated by LMM, whereas other methods not accounting for sample-specific mixed effects led to serious inflation. LMM identified 37 potentially significant genes with differential expression in DLPFC for at least one of the AD traits, 17 of which were replicated in the additional RNA-Seq data of DLPFC, supplemental motor area, spinal cord, and muscle tissues. This application study showed not only well calibrated DGE results by LMM, but also possibly shared gene regulatory mechanisms of AD traits across different relevant tissues.© 2023.

To alleviate this problem, we proposed the EpiMCI, a model for multi-way chromatin interaction prediction based on a hypergraph neural network with epigenomic signals as the input. The EpiMCI integrated separate hyperedge representations with coupling hyperedge information and obtained AUCs of 0.981 and 0.984 in the GM12878 and K562 datasets, respectively, which outperformed the current available method. Moreover, the EpiMCI can be applied to denoise the HiPore-C data and improve the data quality efficiently. Furthermore, the vertex embeddings extracted from the EpiMCI reflected the global chromatin architecture accurately. The principal component analysis suggested that it was well aligned with the activities of genomic regions at the chromatin compartment level. Taken together, the EpiMCI can accurately predict multi-way chromatin interactions and can be applied to studies relying on chromatin architecture."

Raw data generated by whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) requires several computational steps before it is ready for statistical analysis, and particular care is required to process data in a timely and memory-efficient manner. Alignment to a reference genome is one of the most computationally demanding steps in a WGBS workflow, taking several hours or even days with commonly used WGBS-specific alignment software. This naturally motivates the creation of computational workflows that can utilize GPU-based alignment software to greatly speed up the bottleneck step. In addition, WGBS produces raw data that is large and often unwieldy; a lack of memory-efficient representation of data by existing pipelines renders WGBS impractical or impossible to many researchers.We present BiocMAP, a Bioconductor-friendly methylation analysis pipeline consisting of two modules, to address the above concerns. The first module performs computationally-intensive read alignment using Arioc, a GPU-accelerated short-read aligner. Since GPUs are not always available on the same computing environments where traditional CPU-based analyses are convenient, the second module may be run in a GPU-free environment. This module extracts and merges DNA methylation proportions-the fractions of methylated cytosines across all cells in a sample at a given genomic site. Bioconductor-based output objects in R utilize an on-disk data representation to drastically reduce required main memory and make WGBS projects computationally feasible to more researchers.BiocMAP is implemented using Nextflow and available at http://research.libd.org/BiocMAP/ . To enable reproducible analysis across a variety of typical computing environments, BiocMAP can be containerized with Docker or Singularity, and executed locally or with the SLURM or SGE scheduling engines.

Subjects were classified into pre-pregnancy obese and non-obese subgroups by pBMI levels with a cutoff of 25 kg/m2. Sensitivity to thyroid hormone was evaluated by Thyroid Feedback Quartile-Based Index (TFQI), Chinese-referenced parametric TFQI (PTFQI), TSH Index (TSHI) and Thyrotrophic T4 Resistance Index (TT4RI). The associations between these composite indices and GDM were analyzed using multivariate regression models in the two subgroups, respectively.In pre-pregnancy non-obese group, early pregnancy TFQI, PTFQI, TSHI and TT4RI levels were higher in subjects with incident GDM compared to those without GDM (all P < 0.05). By contrast, obese women with GDM exhibited lower levels of those indices (all P < 0.05). The occurrence of GDM were increased with rising TFQI, PTFQI, TSHI and TT4RI quartiles in non-obese women ( all P for trend < 0.05), while exhibited decreased trend across quartiles of those indices in obese women (all P for trend < 0.05).

During pregnancy, certain deficiencies in critical nutrients are mainly associated with central nervous system impairment. The vitamin B9 (folate) is primarily related to one-carbon and methionine metabolism, participating in methyl donor generation. In addition, supplementation with folic acid (FA) is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) in the first three gestational months to prevent neural tube defects. Vitamin B12 is related to folate regeneration, converting it into an active form. Deficiencies in this vitamin have a negative impact on cognitive function and brain development since it is involved in myelin synthesis. Vitamin D is intimately associated with Ca2+levels, acting in bone development and calcium-dependent signaling. This vitamin is associated with ASD at several levels since it has a relation with ASD genes and oxidative stress environment. This review carries the recent literature about the role of folate, vitamin B12, and vitamin D in ASD. In addition, we discuss the possible impact of nutrient deficiency or hypersupplementation during fetal development. On the other hand, we explore the biases of vitamin supplementation studies such as the loss of participants in retrospective studies, as well as multiple variants that are not considered in the conclusion, like dietary intake or auto-medication during pregnancy. In this regard, we aim to contribute to the discussion about the role of vitamins in ASD currency, but also in pregnancy and fetal development as well. Furthermore, stress during pregnancy can be an ASD predisposition, with cortisol as a regulator. In this view, we propose that cortisol is the bridge of susceptibility between vitamin disorders and ASD prevalence.© 2023.

IBD (including CD and UC), and nine mental disorders were used as both exposures and outcomes.We found that UC could significantly lead to obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and autism spectrum disorder, with odds ratio (OR) of 1.245 (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 1.069-1.450;P=0.008), 1.050 (95%CI: 1.023-1.077;P=2.42×10-4), and 1.041 (95%CI: 1.015-1.068;P=0.002) respectively. In addition, we found that bipolar disorder and schizophrenia could increase the odds of IBD, with OR values of 1.138 (95%CI: 1.084-1.194;P=1.9×10-7), and 1.115 (95%CI: 1.071-1.161;P=1.12×10-7), respectively. Our results also indicate that obsessive-compulsive disorder could lead to IBD, especially for UC, with OR values of 1.091 (95%CI: 1.024-1.162;P=0.009), and 1.124 (95%CI: 1.041-1.214;P=0.004), respectively.Our findings indicate that the brain-gut axis involves the association between IBD, especially UC, and some mental disorders, which guides the targeted prevention, management, and mechanism exploration of these diseases.Copyright © 2023 Yang, Yang, Zhang, Zhang, Chen and Zuo."
"693",37854422,"Advances in the molecular neurobiology of posttraumatic stress disorder from global contexts: A systematic review of longitudinal studies.","Glob Ment Health (Camb)","Trauma exposure is prevalent globally and is a defining event for the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), characterised by intrusive thoughts, avoidance behaviours, hypervigilance and negative alterations in cognition and mood. Exposure to trauma elicits a range of physiological responses which can interact with environmental factors to confer relative risk or resilience for PTSD. This systematic review summarises the findings of longitudinal studies examining biological correlates predictive of PTSD symptomology. Databases (Pubmed, Scopus and Web of Science) were systematically searched using relevant keywords for studies published between 1 January 2021 and 31 December 2022. English language studies were included if they were original research manuscripts or meta-analyses of cohort investigations that assessed longitudinal relationships between one or more molecular-level measures and either PTSD status or symptoms. Eighteen of the 1,042 records identified were included. Studies primarily included military veterans/personnel, individuals admitted to hospitals after acute traumatic injury, and women exposed to interpersonal violence or rape. Genomic, inflammation and endocrine measures were the most commonly assessed molecular markers and highlighted processes related to inflammation, stress responding, and learning and memory. Quality assessments were done using the Systematic Appraisal of Quality in Observational Research, and the majority of studies were rated as being of high quality, with the remainder of moderate quality. Studies were predominantly conducted in upper-income countries. Those performed in low- and middle-income countries were not broadly representative in terms of demographic, trauma type and geographic profiles, with three out of the four studies conducted assessing only female participants, rape exposure and South Africa, respectively. They also did not generate multimodal data or use machine learning or multilevel modelling, potentially reflecting greater resource limitations in LMICs. Research examining molecular contributions to PTSD does not adequately reflect the global burden of the disorder.© The Author(s) 2023."

We conducted this two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to comprehensively investigate associations of blood lipids with psychiatric disorders.Univariable and multivariable models were established for MR analyses. Inverse variance-weighted (IVW) MR was employed as the main approach; weighted median and MR-Egger were used as sensitivity analysis methods. The possibility of violating MR assumptions was evaluated utilizing several sensitivity analyses, including heterogeneity statistics, horizontal pleiotropy statistics, single SNP analysis, leave-one-out analysis and MR-PRESSO analysis. As instrumental variables, we screened 362 independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) related to blood lipids from a recent genome-wide association study involving 76,627 individuals of European ancestry, with a genome-wide significance level of p < 5 × 10- 8. Summary-level information for the six psychiatric disorders was extracted from Psychiatric Genomics Consortium and Alzheimer Disease Genetics Consortium.We observed eight significant associations in univariable MR analysis, four of which were corroborated by multivariable MR (MVMR) analysis modified for the other three lipid traits: high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level with the risk of PTSD (OR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.85-0.97, p = 0.002) and AD (OR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.71-0.88, p < 0.001) and triglycerides (TG) level with the risk of MDD (OR = 1.02, 95% CI = 1.003-1.03, p = 0.01) and panic disorder (OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.74-0.92, p < 0.001). In addition, four associations were not significant in MVMR analysis after adjustment for three lipid traits: total cholesterol (TC) level with the risk of PTSD, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level with the risk of MDD and AD and TG level with the risk of AD.Our results show that blood lipids and psychiatric disorders may be related in a causal manner. This shows that abnormal blood lipid levels may act as reliable biomarker of psychiatric disorders and as suitable targets for their prevention and treatment.© 2023.

"695",37833589,"Chemogenetic activation of CRF neurons as a model of chronic stress produces sex-specific physiological and behavioral effects.","Neuropsychopharmacology","Trauma and chronic stress exposure are the strongest predictors of lifetime neuropsychiatric disease presentation. These disorders often have significant sex biases, with females having higher incidences of affective disorders such as major depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Understanding the mechanisms by which stress exposure heightens disease vulnerability is essential for developing novel interventions. Current rodent stress models consist of a battery of sensory, homeostatic, and psychological stressors that are ultimately integrated by corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) neurons to trigger corticosteroid release. These stress paradigms, however, often differ between research groups in the type, timing, and duration of stressors utilized. These inconsistencies, along with the variability of individual animals' perception and response to each stressor, present challenges for reproducibility and translational relevance. Here, we hypothesized that a more direct approach using chemogenetic activation of CRF neurons would recapitulate the effects of traditional stress paradigms and provide a high-throughput method for examining stress-relevant phenotypes. Using a transgenic approach to express the Gq-coupled Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD) receptor hM3Dq in CRF-neurons, we found that the DREADD ligand clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) produced an acute and robust activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, as predicted. Interestingly, chronic treatment with this method of direct CRF activation uncovered a novel sex-specific dissociation of glucocorticoid levels with stress-related outcomes. Despite hM3Dq-expressing females producing greater corticosterone levels in response to CNO than males, hM3Dq-expressing males showed significant typical physiological stress sensitivity with reductions in body and thymus weights. hM3Dq-expressing females while resistant to the physiological effects of chronic CRF activation, showed significant increases in baseline and fear-conditioned freezing behaviors. These data establish a novel mouse model for interrogating stress-relevant phenotypes and highlight sex-specific stress circuitry distinct for physiological and limbic control that may underlie disease risk.© 2023.

Electronic health records (EHR) provide an opportunity to overcome prior clinical knowledge gaps and uncover associations with biological relevance that potentially vary by sex.PTSD was defined among biobank participants (total N=123,365) in a major healthcare system using two ICD code-based definitions: broad (1+ PTSD or acute stress codes versus 0; NCase=14,899) and narrow (2+ PTSD codes versus 0; NCase=3,026). Using a phenome-wide association (PheWAS) design, we tested associations between each PTSD definition and all prevalent disease umbrella categories, i.e., phecodes. We also conducted sex-stratified PheWAS analyses including a sex-by-diagnosis interaction term in each logistic regression.A substantial number of phecodes were significantly associated with PTSDNarrow(61%) and PTSDBroad(83%). While top associations were shared between the two definitions, PTSDBroadcaptured 334 additional phecodes not significantly associated with PTSDNarrowand exhibited a wider range of significantly associated phecodes across various categories, including respiratory, genitourinary, and circulatory conditions. Sex differences were observed, in that PTSDBroadwas more strongly associated with osteoporosis, respiratory failure, hemorrhage, and pulmonary heart disease among male patients, and with urinary tract infection, acute pharyngitis, respiratory infections, and overweight among female patients.This study provides valuable insights into a diverse range of comorbidities associated with PTSD, including both known and novel associations, while highlighting the influence of sex differences and the impact of defining PTSD using EHR."

The role of DNA and histone methylation in bacterial infections.","Epigenetics","Epigenetics describes chemical modifications of the genome that do not alter DNA sequence but participate in the regulation of gene expression and cellular processes such as proliferation, division, and differentiation of eukaryotic cell. Disruption of the epigenome pattern in a human cell is associated with different diseases, including infectious diseases. During infection pathogens induce epigenetic modifications in the host cell. This can occur by controlling expression of genes involved in immune response. That enables bacterial survival and replication within the host and evasion of the immune response. Methylation is an example of epigenetic modification that occurs on DNA and histones. Reasoning that DNA and histone methylation of human host cells plays a crucial role during pathogenesis, these modifications are promising targets for the development of alternative treatment strategies in infectious diseases. Here, we discuss the role of DNA and histone methyltransferases in human host cell upon bacterial infections. We further hypothesize that compounds targeting methyltransferases are tools to study epigenetics in the context of host-pathogen interactions and can open new avenues for the treatment of bacterial infections."

Medical data often contain thousands of features and identifying potential biomarkers is challenging due to small number of samples in the data, method dependence and non-reproducibility. This paper proposes a novel ensemble feature selection method, named Filter and Wrapper Stacking Ensemble (FWSE), to identify reproducible biomarkers from high-dimensional omics data. In FWSE, filter feature selection methods are run on numerous subsets of the data to eliminate irrelevant features, and then wrapper feature selection methods are applied to rank the top features. The method was validated on four high-dimensional medical datasets related to mental illnesses and cancer. The results indicate that the features selected by FWSE are stable and statistically more significant than the ones obtained by existing methods while also demonstrating biological relevance. Furthermore, FWSE is a generic method, applicable to various high-dimensional datasets in the fields of machine intelligence and bioinformatics.© The Author(s) 2023.

Molecular biomarkers play key roles in its prognosis. In particular, immune-related lncRNAs (IRL) have attracted enormous interest in diagnosis and treatment, but less is known about their potential functions. We aimed to investigate dysfunctional IRL and construct a risk model for improving the outcomes of patients. Nineteen immune cell types were collected for identifying house-keeping lncRNAs (HKLncRNA). GSE39582 and TCGA-COAD were treated as the discovery and validation datasets, respectively. Four machine learning algorithms (LASSO, Random Forest, Boruta, and Xgboost) and a Gaussian mixture model were utilized to mine the optimal combination of lncRNAs. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression was utilized to construct the risk score model. We distinguished the functional difference in an immune perspective between low- and high-risk cohorts calculated by this scoring system. Finally, we provided a nomogram. By leveraging the microarray, sequencing, and clinical data for immune cells and colon cancer patients, we identified the 221 HKLncRNAs with a low cell type-specificity index. Eighty-seven lncRNAs were up-regulated in the immune compared to cancer cells. Twelve lncRNAs were beneficial in improving performance. A risk score model with three lncRNAs (CYB561D2, LINC00638, and DANCR) was proposed with robust ROC performance on an independent dataset. According to immune-related analysis, the risk score is strongly associated with the tumor immune microenvironment. Our results emphasized IRL has the potential to be a powerful and effective therapy for enhancing the prognostic of colon cancer.© 2023.

However, molecular mechanisms that underlie this risk are largely unidentified. TBI triggers widespread epigenetic modifications. Similarly, NDs such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's are associated with numerous epigenetic changes. Although epigenetic changes can persist after TBI, it is unresolved if these modifications increase the risk of later ND development and/or dementia. We briefly review TBI-related epigenetic changes, and point out putative feedback loops that might contribute to long-term persistence of some modifications. We then focus on evidence suggesting persistent TBI-associated epigenetic changes may contribute to pathological processes (e.g., neuroinflammation) which may facilitate the development of specific NDs - Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, or chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Finally, we discuss possible directions for TBI therapies that may help prevent or delay development of NDs.Copyright © 2023 Smolen, Dash and Redell."
"704",37889793,NA,NA,"Dairy cows require a balanced diet that provides enough nutrients to support milk production, growth, and reproduction. Inadequate nutrition can lead to metabolic disorders, impaired fertility, and reduced milk yield. Recent studies have shown that nutrition can affect epigenetic modifications in dairy cows, which can impact gene expression and affect the cows' health and productivity. One of the most important epigenetic modifications in dairy cows is DNA methylation, which involves the addition of a methyl group to the DNA molecule. Studies have shown that the methylation status of certain genes in dairy cows can be influenced by dietary factors such as the level of methionine, lysine, choline, and folate in the diet. Other important epigenetic modifications in dairy cows are histone modification and microRNAs as regulators of gene expression. Overall, these findings suggest that nutrition can have a significant impact on the epigenetic regulation of gene expression in dairy cows. By optimizing the diet of dairy cows, it may be possible to improve their health and productivity by promoting beneficial epigenetic modifications. This paper reviews the main nutrients that can cause epigenetic changes in dairy cattle by analyzing the effect of diet on milk production and its composition."

We found that approximately a quarter of the individuals carry a clonally-expanded mCA in at least one tissue, with incidence strongly correlated with age. The prevalence and genome-wide patterns of mCAs vary considerably across tissue types, suggesting tissue-specific mutagenic exposure and selection pressures. The mCA landscapes in normal adrenal and pituitary glands resemble those in tumors arising from these tissues, whereas the same is not true for the esophagus and skin.

CHIP occurs frequently with ageing - more than 10% of individuals over 65 years of age are affected - and is associated with an increased risk of disease across several organ systems and premature death. Emerging evidence suggests that CHIP has a role in kidney health, including associations with predisposition to acute kidney injury, impaired recovery from acute kidney injury and kidney function decline, both in the general population and among those with chronic kidney disease. Beyond its direct effect on the kidney, CHIP elevates the susceptibility of individuals to various conditions that can detrimentally affect the kidneys, including cardiovascular disease, obesity and insulin resistance, liver disease, gout, osteoporosis and certain autoimmune diseases. Aberrant pro-inflammatory signalling, telomere attrition and epigenetic ageing are potential causal pathophysiological pathways and mediators that underlie CHIP-related disease risk.

Improving our understanding of underlying processes is important to develop personalized approaches to management.We investigated whether: 1) global genetic variability differs in women with TS, which might contribute to co-morbidities; 2) common variants in X genes - on the background of haploinsufficiency - are associated with phenotype (a ""two-hit"" hypothesis); 3) the previously reported association of autosomalTIMP3variants with CCA can be replicated.Whole exome sequencing was undertaken in leukocyte DNA from 134 adult women with TS and compared to 46,XX controls (n=23), 46,XX women with primary ovarian insufficiency (n=101), and 46,XY controls (n=11). 1) Variability in autosomal and X chromosome genes was analyzed for all individuals; 2) the relation between common X chromosome variants and the long-term phenotypes listed above was investigated in a subgroup of women with monosomy X; 3)TIMP3variance was investigated in relation to CCA.Standard filtering identified 6,457,085 autosomal variants and 126,335 X chromosome variants for the entire cohort, whereas a somatic variant pipeline identified 16,223 autosomal and 477 X chromosome changes. 1) Overall exome variability of autosomal genes was similar in women with TS and control/comparison groups, whereas X chromosome variants were proportionate to the complement of X chromosome material; 2) when adjusted for multiple comparisons, no X chromosome gene/variants were strongly enriched in monosomy X women with key phenotypes compared to monosomy X women without these conditions, although several variants of interest emerged; 3) an association betweenTIMP322:32857305:C-T and CCA was found (CCA 13.6%; non-CCA 3.4%, p<0.02).Women with TS do not have an excess of genetic variability in exome analysis. No obvious X-chromosome variants driving phenotype were found, but several possible genes/variants of interest emerged. A reported association between autosomalTIMP3variance and congenital cardiac anomalies was replicated.Copyright © 2023 Suntharalingham, Ishida, Cameron-Pimblett, McGlacken-Byrne, Buonocore, del Valle, Madhan, Brooks, Conway and Achermann."

Research indicates that exercise can positively influence MetS-associated conditions and TL. However, the effects of low-volume exercise types on TL are still unknown. We investigated the impact of very-low-volume high-intensity interval training (LV-HIIT), one-set resistance training (1-RT), and whole-body electromyostimulation (WB-EMS) on TL, inflammation, and cardiometabolic indices in 167 MetS patients. Data were derived from two randomized controlled trials where patients were allocated to an exercise group (2 sessions/week, for 12 weeks) or a control group. All groups received standard-care nutritional weight loss counselling. TL was determined as the T/S ratio (telomere to single-copy gene amount). All groups significantly reduced body weight (p< 0.05), but the T/S-ratio (p< 0.001) only increased with LV-HIIT. OS-related inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein) only decreased (p< 0.05) following LV-HIIT. The MetS severity z-score improved with LV-HIIT (p< 0.001) and 1-RT (p= 0.014) but not with WB-EMS. In conclusion, very-low-volume exercise modalities have differential effects on telomeres, inflammation, and cardiometabolic health. Only LV-HIIT but not strength-based low-volume exercise increased TL in MetS patients, presumably due to superior effects on OS-related inflammatory markers."

The aim of this study was to analyze the association between the ALT/HDL-C ratio and NAFLD.We conducted a retrospective analysis of data from 14,251 individuals participating in the NAGALA project's health screening program. The presence of NAFLD was diagnosed based on the participants' alcohol consumption status and liver ultrasonography images. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess the association between the ALT/HDL-C ratio and NAFLD. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to determine and compare the effectiveness of ALT, HDL-C, the aspartate aminotransferase to HDL-C (AST/HDL-C) ratio, the gamma-glutamyl transferase to HDL-C (GGT/HDL-C) ratio and the ALT/HDL-C ratio in identifying NAFLD.We observed a significant positive association between the ALT/HDL-C ratio and the prevalence of NAFLD. For each standard deviation (SD) increase in the ALT/HDL-C ratio, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for NAFLD among the participants was 3.05 [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.63, 3.53], with the highest quartile of ALT/HDL-C ratio having a 9.96-fold increased risk compared to the lowest quartile. In further subgroup analyses stratified by gender, age, and waist circumference (WC), we observed a significantly higher risk of NAFLD associated with the ALT/HDL-C ratio among individuals aged ≥45 years, males, and those who were abdominal obesity. Furthermore, based on the results of ROC analysis, we found that the ALT/HDL-C ratio [area under the curves (AUC): 0.8553] was significantly superior to ALT, HDL-C, AST/HDL-C ratio and GGT/HDL-C ratio in identifying NAFLD (All DelongP<0.05); the threshold of suggested ALT/HDL-C ratio for identifying NAFLD was 15.97.This population-based study demonstrates a positive association between the ALT/HDL-C ratio and NAFLD. The ALT/HDL-C ratio can effectively identify individuals with NAFLD.Copyright © 2023 Qiu, Kuang, Yang, Yu, He, Sheng and Zou."

Here we report an exploration of genetic influences in stunted Zambian children with environmental enteropathy.Children with stunting (LAZ < -2) were enrolled and given nutritional therapy. Those that were non-responsive to therapy were designated as cases, and children with good growth (LAZ > -1) from the same community as controls. Blood and stool samples were taken to measure biomarkers of intestinal inflammation, epithelial damage, and microbial translocation. Single nucleotide polymorphism array genotyping was carried out on saliva samples using the H3Africa consortium array.Genome wide associations were analysed in 117 cases and 41 controls. While no significant associations with stunting were observed at P<5x10-8, likely due to the small sample size, interesting associations were observed at lower thresholds. SNPs associated with stunting were in genomic regions known to modulate neuronal differentiation and fatty acid biosynthesis. SNPs associated with increased microbial translocation were associated with non-integrin membrane ECM interactions, tight junctions, hemostasis, and G-alpha signalling events. SNPs associated with increased inflammation were associated with, ECM interactions, purine metabolism, axon guidance, and cell motility. SNPs negatively associated with inflammation overlapped genes involved in semaphoring interactions. We explored the existing coeliac disease risk HLA genotypes and found present: DQ2.5 (7.5%), DQ8 (3.5%) and DQ2.2 (3.8%); however, no children were positive for coeliac antibodies. We detected HLA-DRB:1301 and HLA-C:1802 with high odds ratios and P<0.05 in stunted children compared to controls.Genetic variations associated with stunting and the enteropathy underlying it, include variants associated with multiple pathways relating to gene expression, glycosylation, nerve signalling, and sensing of the nutritional and microbiological milieu.Copyright: © 2023 Mweetwa et al.

To understand the molecular mechanisms of cancer progression, acquired drug resistance, and the metastatic process, the use of preclinical in vitro models that faithfully summarize the properties of the tumor in patients is still a necessity. The tumor is represented by a diverse group of cell clones, and in recent years, to reproduce in vitro preclinical tumor models, monolayer cell cultures have been supplanted by patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models and cultured organoids derived from the patient (PDO). These models have proved indispensable for the study of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and its interaction with tumor cells. Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common neoplasia in men in the world. It is characterized by genomic instability and resistance to conventional therapies. Despite recent advances in diagnosis and treatment, PCa remains a leading cause of cancer death. Here, we review the studies of the last 10 years as the number of papers is growing very fast in the field. We also discuss the discovered limitations and the new challenges in using the organoid culture system and in using PDXs in studying the prostate cancer phenotype, performing drug testing, and developing anticancer molecular therapies."

Unfortunately, because of the heterogeneity of pancreatic cancer, it is difficult to find a personalized treatment strategy for patients. Organoids are ideal preclinical models for personalized medicine. Therefore, we explore the cultivation conditions and construction methods of PDAC organoid models to screen the individualized therapy strategy.Fresh PDAC tissues from surgical resection were collected and digested with digestive enzymes; then the tumor cells were embedded in Matrigel with a suitable medium to establish the PDAC organoid models. The genetic stability of the organoids was analyzed using whole exon sequencing; hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry of organoids were performed to analyze their consistency with the pathological morphology of the patient's tumor tissue; After 2 days of organoid culture, we selected four commonly used clinical chemotherapy drugs for single or combined treatment to analyze drug sensitivity.Two cases of PDAC organoid models were successfully established, and the results of their pathological characteristics and exome sequencing were consistent with those of the patient's tumor tissue. Both PDAC organoids showed more sensitivity to gemcitabine and cisplatin, and the combined treatment was more effective than monotherapy.Both organoids better retained the pathological characteristics, genomic stability, and heterogeneity with the original tumor. Individual PDAC organoids exhibited different sensitivities to the same drugs. Thus, this study provided ideal experimental models for screening individualized therapy strategy for patients with PDAC.© 2023 The Authors.

"722",37880806,NA,NA,"Patient Derived Organoids (PDOs) emerged as the best technology to develop ex vivo tumor avatars. Whether drug testing on PDOs to identify efficient therapies will bring clinical utility by improving patient survival remains unclear. To test this hypothesis in the frame of clinical trials, PDO technology faces three main challenges to be implemented in routine clinical practices: i) generating PDOs with a limited amount of tumor material; ii) testing a wide panel of anti-cancer drugs; and iii) obtaining results within a time frame compatible with patient disease management. We aimed to address these challenges in a prospective study in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC).Fresh surgical or core needle biopsies were obtained from patients with CRC. PDOs were established and challenged with a panel of 25 FDA-approved anti-cancer drugs (chemotherapies and targeted therapies) to establish a scoring method ('chemogram') identifying in vitro responders. The results were analyzed at the scale of the cohort and individual patients when the follow-up data were available.A total of 25 PDOs were successfully established, harboring 94% concordance with the genomic profile of the tumor they were derived from. The take-on rate for PDOs derived from core needle biopsies was 61.5%. A chemogram was obtained with a 6-week median turnaround time (range, 4-10 weeks). At least one hit (mean 6.16) was identified for 92% of the PDOs. The number of hits was inversely correlated to disease metastatic dissemination and the number of lines of treatment the patient received. The chemograms were compared to clinical data obtained from 8 patients and proved to be predictive of their response with 75% sensitivity and specificity.We show that PDO-based drug tests can be achieved in the frame of routine clinical practice. The chemogram could provide clinicians with a decision-making tool to tailor patient treatment. Thus, PDO-based functional precision oncology should now be tested in interventional trials assessing its clinical utility for patients who do not harbor activable genomic alterations or have developed resistance to standard of care treatments.© 2023.

However, their usage is limited due to lengthy establishment time, high engraftment failure rates and different tumor microenvironment from original tumors. To overcome the limitations, we developed real time-live tissue sensitivity assay (RT-LTSA) using fresh tumor samples.Tissue slices from resected pancreatic cancer samples were placed in 96-well plates, and the slices were treated with chemotherapeutic agents. The correlation between the chemo-sensitivity of tissue slices and each patient's clinical outcome was analyzed.The viability and tumor microenvironment of the tissue slices are well-preserved over 5 days. The drug sensitivity assay results are available within 5 days after tissue collection. While all 4 patients who received RT-LTSA sensitive adjuvant regimens did not develop recurrence, 7 of 8 patients who received resistant adjuvant regimens developed recurrence. We observed significantly improved disease-free survival in the patients who received RT-LTSA sensitive adjuvant regimens (median: not reached versus 10.6 months,P= 0.02) compared with the patient who received resistant regimens. A significant negative correlation between RT-LTSA value and relapse-free survival was observed (Somer's D: -0.58;P= 0.016).RT-LTSA which maintains the tumor microenvironment and architecture as found in patients may reflect clinical outcome and could be used as a personalized strategy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

However, its transcriptome has been compiled using short-read sequencing data, which fails to capture most full-length mRNAs. Here, we generate an isoform-resolved transcriptome of early human development by performing long- and short-read RNA sequencing on 73 embryos spanning the zygote to blastocyst stages. We identify 110,212 unannotated isoforms transcribed from known genes, including highly conserved protein-coding loci and key developmental regulators. We further identify 17,964 isoforms from 5,239 unannotated genes, which are largely non-coding, primate-specific, and highly associated with transposable elements. These isoforms are widely supported by the integration of published multi-omics datasets, including single-cell 8CLC and blastoid studies. Alternative splicing and gene co-expression network analyses further reveal that embryonic genome activation is associated with splicing disruption and transient upregulation of gene modules. Together, these findings show that the human embryo transcriptome is far more complex than currently known, and will act as a valuable resource to empower future studies exploring development.© 2023.

Previous studies have evaluated the predictive utility of omics measurements, such as metabolites, proteins or polygenic scores, but have considered these separately. The improvement that combined omics biomarkers can provide over and above current clinical standard models is unclear. The aim of this study was to test the predictive performance of genome, proteome, metabolome and clinical biomarkers when added to established clinical prediction models for type 2 diabetes.We developed sparse interpretable prediction models in a prospective, nested type 2 diabetes case-cohort study (N=1105, incident type 2 diabetes cases=375) with 10,792 person-years of follow-up, selecting from 5759 features across the genome, proteome, metabolome and clinical biomarkers using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. We compared the predictive performance of omics-derived predictors with a clinical model including the variables from the Cambridge Diabetes Risk Score and HbA1c.Among single omics prediction models that did not include clinical risk factors, the top ten proteins alone achieved the highest performance (concordance index [C index]=0.82 [95% CI 0.75, 0.88]), suggesting the proteome as the most informative single omic layer in the absence of clinical information. However, the largest improvement in prediction of type 2 diabetes incidence over and above the clinical model was achieved by the top ten features across several omic layers (C index=0.87 [95% CI 0.82, 0.92], Δ C index=0.05, p=0.045). This improvement by the top ten omic features was also evident in individuals with HbA1c<42 mmol/mol (6.0%), the threshold for prediabetes (C index=0.84 [95% CI 0.77, 0.90], Δ C index=0.07, p=0.03), the group in whom prediction would be most useful since they are not targeted for preventative interventions by current clinical guidelines. In this subgroup, the type 2 diabetes polygenic risk score was the major contributor to the improvement in prediction, and achieved a comparable improvement in performance when added onto the clinical model alone (C index=0.83 [95% CI 0.75, 0.90], Δ C index=0.06, p=0.002). However, compared with those with prediabetes, individuals at high polygenic risk in this group had only around half the absolute risk for type 2 diabetes over a 20 year period.Omic approaches provided marginal improvements in prediction of incident type 2 diabetes. However, while a polygenic risk score does improve prediction in people with an HbA1cin the normoglycaemic range, the group in whom prediction would be most useful, even individuals with a high polygenic burden in that subgroup had a low absolute type 2 diabetes risk. This suggests a limited feasibility of implementing targeted population-based genetic screening for preventative interventions.© 2023. The Author(s)."

While the relationship between the underlying disease and diet is natural in conditions such as metabolic disorders, obesity, diabetes, etc., the direct effect is not so evident in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Poor diet quality and the development of nutrient deficiencies in respiratory diseases, including COPD, can be associated with disease-specific factors such as the exacerbation of respiratory symptoms. These symptoms can be improved by dietary interventions, leading to positive changes in the pathogenesis of the disease and the quality of life of patients. Therefore, our aim was to review the latest randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of dietary interventions in chronic respiratory patients and describe their effects on respiratory function, physical activity, systemic inflammatory parameters, and quality of life. We conducted a literature search on dietary interventions for COPD patients in the PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases, focusing on publications from 1 July 2018 to 1 July 2023. We used specific keywords and MESH terms, focusing on RCTs. A total of 26 articles and 1811 COPD patients were included in this review.

As epigenetic processes are suggested to contribute to the development of ageing-associated diseases, we investigated whether differential DNA methylation was associated with IR in human primary muscle stem cells (myoblasts) from community-dwelling older individuals.We measured DNA methylation (Infinium HumanMethylationEPIC BeadChip) in myoblast cultures from vastus lateralis biopsies (119 males/females, mean age 78.24 years) from the Hertfordshire Sarcopenia Study extension (HSSe) and examined differentially methylated cytosine phosphate guanine (CpG) sites (dmCpG), regions (DMRs) and gene pathways associated with HOMA2-IR, an index for the assessment of insulin resistance, and levels of glycated hemoglobin HbA1c.Thirty-eight dmCpGs (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05) were associated with HOMA2-IR, with dmCpGs enriched in genes linked with JNK, AMPK and insulin signaling. The methylation signal associated with HOMA2-IR was attenuated after the addition of either BMI (6 dmCpGs), appendicular lean mass index (ALMi) (7 dmCpGs), grip strength (15 dmCpGs) or gait speed (23 dmCpGs) as covariates in the model. There were 8 DMRs (Stouffer < 0.05) associated with HOMA2-IR, including DMRs within T-box transcription factor (TBX1) and nuclear receptor subfamily-2 group F member-2 (NR2F2); the DMRs within TBX1 and NR2F2 remained associated with HOMA2-IR after adjustment for BMI, ALMi, grip strength or gait speed. Forty-nine dmCpGs and 21 DMRs were associated with HbA1c, with cg13451048, located within exoribonuclease family member 3 (ERI3) associated with both HOMA2-IR and HbA1c. HOMA2-IR and HbA1c were not associated with accelerated epigenetic ageing.These findings suggest that insulin resistance is associated with differential DNA methylation in human primary myoblasts with both muscle mass and body composition making a significant contribution to the methylation changes associated with IR.© 2023.

However, much less is known about the interplay between environmental and genetic risks relevant to ADHD-a better understanding of which could inform both mechanistic models and clinical prediction algorithms.Two independent data sets, the population-based Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (ABCD) (N = 11,876) and the case-control Oregon-ADHD-1000 (N = 1449), were used to examine additive (G + E) and interactive (GxE) effects of selected polygenic risk scores (PRS) and environmental factors in a cross-sectional design. Genetic risk was measured using PRS for nine mental health disorders/traits. Exposures included family income, family conflict/negative sentiment, and geocoded measures of area deprivation, lead exposure risk, and air pollution exposure (nitrogen dioxide and fine particulate matter).ADHD PRS and family conflict jointly predicted concurrent ADHD symptoms in both cohorts. Additive-effects models, including both genetic and environmental factors, explained significantly more variation in symptoms than any individual factor alone (jointR2 = .091 for total symptoms in ABCD; jointR2 = .173 in Oregon-ADHD-1000; all delta-R2p-values <2e-7). Significant effect size heterogeneity across ancestry groups was observed for genetic and environmental factors (e.g.,Q = 9.01,p = .011 for major depressive disorder PRS;Q = 13.34,p = .001 for area deprivation). GxE interactions observed in the full ABCD cohort suggested stronger environmental effects when genetic risk is low, though they did not replicate.Reproducible additive effects of PRS and family environment on ADHD symptoms were found, but GxE interaction effects were not replicated and appeared confounded by ancestry. Results highlight the potential value of combining exposures and PRS in clinical prediction algorithms. The observed differences in risks across ancestry groups warrant further study to avoid health care disparities.© 2023 The Authors.

"734",37880634,"Unveiling adcyap1 as a protective factor linking pain and nerve regeneration through single-cell RNA sequencing of rat dorsal root ganglion neurons.","BMC Biol","Severe peripheral nerve injury (PNI) often leads to significant movement disorders and intractable pain. Therefore, promoting nerve regeneration while avoiding neuropathic pain is crucial for the clinical treatment of PNI patients. However, established animal models for peripheral neuropathy fail to accurately recapitulate the clinical features of PNI. Additionally, researchers usually investigate neuropathic pain and axonal regeneration separately, leaving the intrinsic relationship between the development of neuropathic pain and nerve regeneration after PNI unclear. To explore the underlying connections between pain and regeneration after PNI and provide potential molecular targets, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing and functional verification in an established rat model, allowing simultaneous study of the neuropathic pain and axonal regeneration after PNI.First, a novel rat model named spared nerve crush (SNC) was created. In this model, two branches of the sciatic nerve were crushed, but the epineurium remained unsevered. This model successfully recapitulated both neuropathic pain and axonal regeneration after PNI, allowing for the study of the intrinsic link between these two crucial biological processes. Dorsal root ganglions (DRGs) from SNC and naïve rats at various time points after SNC were collected for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). After matching all scRNA-seq data to the 7 known DRG types, we discovered that the PEP1 and PEP3 DRG neuron subtypes increased in crushed and uncrushed DRG separately after SNC. Using experimental design scRNA-seq processing (EDSSP), we identified Adcyap1 as a potential gene contributing to both pain and nerve regeneration. Indeed, repeated intrathecal administration of PACAP38 mitigated pain and facilitated axonal regeneration, while Adcyap1 siRNA or PACAP6-38, an antagonist of PAC1R (a receptor of PACAP38) led to both mechanical hyperalgesia and delayed DRG axon regeneration in SNC rats. Moreover, these effects can be reversed by repeated intrathecal administration of PACAP38 in the acute phase but not the late phase after PNI, resulting in alleviated pain and promoted axonal regeneration.Our study reveals that Adcyap1 is an intrinsic protective factor linking neuropathic pain and axonal regeneration following PNI.

However, its role in trigeminal neuralgia (TN) has not been well investigated. The current study aims to determine whether BMP7 plays a role in demyelination, its effects on pain behaviors and mechanism of action in rats with TN.We used an infraorbital-nerve chronic-constriction injury (ION-CCI) to establish a rat model of TN. Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) were injected into the rats to upregulate or downregulate BMP7. The mechanical withdrawal thresholds (MWT) of the injured rats were detected using Von Frey filaments. The changes in expression levels of BMP7 and oligodendrocyte (OL) markers were examined by western blotting, quantitative real-time PCR, immunofluorescence, and transmission electron microscopy.The ION-CCI induced mechanical allodynia, demyelination, and loss of OLs with a reduction of BMP7. Short-hairpin RNA (shRNA)-BMP7 that inhibited BMP7 expression also caused mechanical allodynia, demyelination, and loss of OLs, and its mechanism may be OL apoptosis. Overexpressing BMP7 in the trigeminal spinal subnucleus caudalis(VC) with AAV-BMP7 relieved all three phenotypes induced by the CCI, and its mechanism may be alleviating OLs apoptosis. Two signal pathways associated with apoptosis, STAT3 and p65, were significantly downregulated in the VC after CCI and rescued by BMP7 overexpression.BMP7 can alleviate TN by reducing OLs apoptosis and subsequent demyelination. The mechanism behind this protection could be BMP7-mediated activation of the STAT3 and NF-κB/p65 signaling pathway and subsequent decrease in OL apoptosis. Importantly, our study presents clear evidence in support of BMP7 as a possible therapeutic target for the treatment of TN.© 2023. Springer-Verlag Italia S.r.l., part of Springer Nature."

Although the etiology of MS is heterogeneous, it is well established that aberrant activity of adaptive and innate immune cells plays a crucial role in its pathogenesis. Several immune cell abnormalities have been described in MS and its animal models, including T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, neutrophils, microglia/macrophages, and astrocytes, among others. Physical exercise offers a valuable alternative or adjunctive disease-modifying therapy for MS. A growing body of evidence indicates that exercise may reduce the autoimmune responses triggered by immune cells in MS. This is partially accomplished by restricting the infiltration of peripheral immune cells into the central nervous system (CNS) parenchyma, curbing hyperactivation of immune cells, and facilitating a transition in the balance of immune cells from a pro-inflammatory to an anti-inflammatory state. This review provides a succinct overview of the correlation between physical exercise, immune cells, and MS pathology, and highlights the potential benefits of exercise as a strategy for the prevention and treatment of MS.Copyright © 2023 Zong, Yu, Zhang, Zhao, Li and Li."
"737",37759482,NA,NA,"The term neuroinflammation defines the reactions of astrocytes and microglia to alterations in homeostasis in the diseased central nervous system (CNS), the exacerbation of which contributes to the neurodegenerative effects of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Local environmental conditions, such as the presence of proinflammatory molecules, mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM), and local cell-cell interactions, are determinants of glial cell phenotypes. In AD, the load of the cytotoxic/proinflammatory amyloid β (Aβ) peptide is a microenvironmental component increasingly growing in the CNS, imposing time-evolving challenges on resident cells. This study aimed to investigate the temporal and spatial variations of the effects produced by this process on astrocytes and microglia, either directly or by interfering in their interactions.Ex vivoconfocal analyses of hippocampal sections from the mouse model TgCRND8 at different ages have shown that overproduction of Aβ peptide induced early and time-persistent disassembly of functional astroglial syncytium and promoted a senile phenotype of reactive microglia, hindering Aβ clearance. In the late stages of the disease, these patterns were altered in the presence of Aβ-plaques, surrounded by typically reactive astrocytes and microglia. Morphofunctional characterization of peri-plaque gliosis revealed a direct contribution of astrocytes in plaque buildup that might result in shielding Aβ-peptide cytotoxicity and, as a side effect, in exacerbating neuroinflammation."

Here we map IL-12 receptor (IL-12R) expression to NK and T cells as well as neurons and oligodendrocytes. Conditionally ablating the IL-12R across these cell types in adult mice and assessing their susceptibility to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis revealed that the neuroprotective role of IL-12 is mediated by neuroectoderm-derived cells, specifically neurons, and not immune cells. In human brain tissue from donors with multiple sclerosis, we observe an IL-12R distribution comparable to mice, suggesting similar mechanisms in mice and humans.

While their involvement in various diseases is increasingly recognized, their exact role in demyelinating lesions remains uncertain. Astrocytes have the potential to influence demyelination positively or negatively. They can produce and release inflammatory molecules that modulate the activation and movement of other immune cells. Moreover, they can aid in the clearance of myelin debris through phagocytosis and facilitate the recruitment and differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells, thereby promoting axonal remyelination. However, excessive or prolonged astrocyte phagocytosis can exacerbate demyelination and lead to neurological impairments. This review provides an overview of the involvement of astrocytes in various demyelinating diseases, emphasizing the underlying mechanisms that contribute to demyelination.

Here we show that astrocytes upregulate the immunomodulatory checkpoint molecule PD-L1 during acute autoimmune CNS inflammation in response to aryl hydrocarbon receptor and interferon signaling. Using CRISPR-Cas9 genetic perturbation in combination with small-molecule and antibody-mediated inhibition of PD-L1 and PD-1 both in vivo and in vitro, we demonstrate that astrocytic PD-L1 and its interaction with microglial PD-1 is required for the attenuation of autoimmune CNS inflammation in acute and progressive stages in a mouse model of MS.

"742",37681904,"Region-Specific Homeostatic Identity of Astrocytes Is Essential for Defining Their Response to Pathological Insults.","Cells","The transformation of astrocytes into reactive states constitutes a biological response of the central nervous system under a variety of pathological insults. Astrocytes display diverse homeostatic identities that are developmentally predetermined and regionally specified. Upon transformation into reactive states associated with neurodegenerative diseases and other neurological disorders, astrocytes acquire diverse reactive phenotypes. However, it is not clear whether their reactive phenotypes are dictated by region-specific homeostatic identity or by the nature of an insult. To address this question, region-specific gene expression profiling was performed for four brain regions (cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and hypothalamus) in mice using a custom NanoString panel consisting of selected sets of genes associated with astrocyte functions and their reactivity for five conditions: prion disease, traumatic brain injury, brain ischemia, 5XFAD Alzheimer's disease model and normal aging. Upon transformation into reactive states, genes that are predominantly associated with astrocytes were found to respond to insults in a region-specific manner. Regardless of the nature of the insult or the insult-specificity of astrocyte response, strong correlations between undirected GSA (gene set analysis) scores reporting on astrocyte reactivity and on their homeostatic functions were observed within each individual brain region. The insult-specific gene expression signatures did not separate well from each other and instead partially overlapped, forming continuums. The current study demonstrates that region-specific homeostatic identities of astrocytes are important for defining their response to pathological insults. Within region-specific populations, reactive astrocytes show continuums of gene expression signatures, partially overlapping between individual insults."

Genetic variation has been shown to play a considerable role in determining an individual's response to antipsychotic medication. However, previous pharmacogenetic (PGx) studies have been limited by small sample sizes, lack of consensus regarding relevant genetic variants, and cross-sectional designs. The current study aimed to investigate the association between PGx variants and long-term clinical outcomes in 691 patients of European ancestry with SSD. Using evidence from the literature on candidate genes involved in antipsychotic pharmacodynamics, we created a polygenic risk score (PRS) to investigate its association with clinical outcomes. We also created PRS using core variants of psychotropic drug metabolism enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP2C19. Furthermore, the CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 functional activity scores were calculated to determine the relationship between metabolism and clinical outcomes. We found no association for PGx PRSs and clinical outcomes; however, an association was found with CYP2D6 activity scores by the traditional method. Higher CYP2D6 metabolism was associated with high positive and high cognitive impairment groups relative to low symptom severity groups. These findings highlight the need to test PGx efficacy with different symptom domains. More evidence is needed before pharmacogenetic variation can contribute to personalized treatment plans."

Most patients with MS manifest the relapsing-remitting phenotype at a younger age, while progressive phenotypes are mainly seen in older patients. Current disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) primarily targeting adaptive immunity are less efficacious in older patients, suggesting that immunosenescence plays a role in treatment response.

In this study, we analyzed previously published scRNA-seq data from a large cohort of COVID-19 patients, castrated and regenerated mice, and bulk RNA-seq of a RNAi library of 400 genes, and revealed that both immunity and OXPHOS displayed cell-type-, sex-, and age-related variation in the severe or critical COVID-19 patients during disease progression, with a more prominent increase in immunity and decrease in OXPHOS in myeloid cells in the males relative to the females (60-69 years old). Male severe or critical patients above 70 years old were an exception in that the compromised negative correlation between OXPHOS and immunity in these patients was associated with its disordered transcriptional regulation. Finally, the expression levels of OXPHOS and androgens were revealed to be positively correlated, and the responses of macrophages to android fluctuation were more striking than other types of detected immune cells in the castrated mice model.

Similar numbers of infections have been documented in males and females; males, however, are more likely than females to be hospitalized, require intensive care unit, or die from COVID-19. The mechanisms that account for this are multi-factorial and are likely to include differential expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 molecules that are required for viral entry into hosts cells and sex differences in the immune response, which are due to modulation of cellular functions by sex hormones and differences in chromosomal gene expression. Furthermore, as comorbidities are also associated with poorer outcomes to SARS-CoV-2 infection and several comorbidities are overrepresented in males, these are also likely to contribute to the observed sex differences. Despite their relative better prognosis following infection with SARS-CoV-2, females do have poorer outcomes during pregnancy. This is likely to be due to pregnancy-induced changes in the immune system that adversely affect viral immunity and disruption of the renin-angiotensin system. Importantly, vaccination reduces the severity of disease in males and females, including pregnant females, and there is no evidence that vaccination has any adverse effects on the outcomes of pregnancy.© 2023.

Our approach uses scBERT, which harnesses shared transcriptomic features among cell types to establish consistent cell-type annotations across multiple scRNA-seq datasets. Additionally, we employed a symbolic regression algorithm to pinpoint highly relevant, yet minimally redundant models and features for inferring a cell type's disease state based on its transcriptomic profile. We ascertained the versatility of these cell-specific gene signatures across datasets, showcasing their resilience as molecular markers to pinpoint and characterize disease-associated cell types. The validation was carried out using four publicly available scRNA-seq datasets from both healthy individuals and those suffering from ulcerative colitis (UC). This demonstrates our approach's efficacy in bridging disparities specific to different datasets, fostering comparative analyses.

To selectively enrich mRNA from abundant non-polyadenylated transcripts, poly(A) selection is a key step during library preparation. However, some transcripts, such as mitochondrial genes, can escape this elimination and overwhelm libraries. Often, these transcripts are removed in silico, but whether physical depletion improves detection of rare transcripts in single cells is unclear.We find that a single 16S ribosomal RNA is widely enriched in planarian scRNA-seq datasets, independent of the library preparation method. To deplete this transcript from scRNA-seq libraries, we design 30 single-guide RNAs spanning its length. To evaluate the effects of depletion, we perform a side-by-side comparison of the effects of eliminating the 16S transcript and find a substantial increase in the number of genes detected per cell, coupled with virtually complete loss of the 16S RNA. Moreover, we systematically determine that library complexity increases with a limited number of PCR cycles following CRISPR treatment. When compared to in silico depletion of 16S, physically removing it reduces dropout rates, retrieves more clusters, and reveals more differentially expressed genes.Our results show that abundant transcripts reduce the retrieval of informative transcripts in scRNA-seq and distort the analysis. Physical removal of these contaminants enables the detection of rare transcripts at lower sequencing depth, and also outperforms in silico depletion.

It is a key step to facilitate downstream interpretations such as differential expression, trajectory inference, etc. scRNA-seq data contains technical variations that could affect the interpretation of the cell types. Therefore, gene selection, also known as feature selection in data science, plays an important role in selecting informative genes for scRNA-seq cell type identification. Generally speaking, feature selection methods are categorized into filter-, wrapper-, and embedded-based approaches. From the existing literature, methods from filter- and embedded-based approaches are widely applied in scRNA-seq gene selection tasks. The wrapper-based method that gives promising results in other fields has yet been extensively utilized for selecting gene features from scRNA-seq data; in addition, most of the existing wrapper methods used in this field are clustering instead of classification-based. With a large number of annotated data available today, this study applied a classification-based approach as an alternative to the clustering-based wrapper method. In our work, a quantum-inspired differential evolution (QDE) wrapped with a classification method was introduced to select a subset of genes from twelve well-known scRNA-seq transcriptomic datasets to identify cell types. In particular, the QDE was combined with different machine-learning (ML) classifiers namely logistic regression, decision tree, support vector machine (SVM) with linear and radial basis function kernels, as well as extreme learning machine. The linear SVM wrapped with QDE, namely QDE-SVM, was chosen by referring to the feature selection results from the experiment. QDE-SVM showed a superior cell type classification performance among QDE wrapping with other ML classifiers as well as the recent wrapper methods (i.e., FSCAM, SSD-LAHC, MA-HS, and BSF). QDE-SVM achieved an average accuracy of 0.9559, while the other wrapper methods achieved average accuracies in the range of 0.8292 to 0.8872.Copyright: © 2023 Ng et al.

The results obtained from these methods highlight significant opportunities for improvement.In this article, we propose a potential avenue for enhancement through the development of a semi-supervised convolutional neural network based approach. Named ""ScribbleDom"", our method leverages human expert's input as a form of semi-supervision, thereby seamlessly combines the cognitive abilities of human experts with the computational power of machines. ScribbleDom incorporates a loss function that integrates two crucial components: similarity in gene expression profiles and adherence to the valuable input of a human annotator through scribbles on histology images, providing prior knowledge about spot labels. The spatial continuity of the tissue domains is taken into account by extracting information on the spot microenvironment through convolution filters of varying sizes, in the form of ""Inception"" blocks. By leveraging this semi-supervised approach, ScribbleDom significantly improves the quality of spatial domains, yielding superior results both quantitatively and qualitatively.

We utilized UMAP, TSNE, and clustering algorithm Louvain for dimensionality reduction and FindAllMarkers function for determining the DEGs. Monocle2 was utilized to perform pseudo-time series analysis. SCENIC was implemented for transcription factor analysis of each cell subgroup. A series of WB, CFA, CCK-8, and EDU analysis was utilized for the validation of the role of MT2A in ccRCC carcinogenesis. We observed higher infiltration of T/NK and B cells in tumorous tissues, indicating the role of immune cells in ccRCC carcinogenesis. Transcription factor analysis revealed the activation of EOMES and ETS1 in CD8 + T cells, while CAFs were divided into myo-CAFs and i-CAFs, with i-CAFs showing distinct enrichment of ATF3, JUND, JUNB, EGR1, and XBP1. Through cell trajectory analysis, we discerned three distinct stages of cellular evolution, where State2 symbolizes normal renal tubular cells that underwent transitions into State1 and State3 as the CNV score ascended. Functional enrichment examination revealed an amplification of interferon gamma and inflammatory response pathways within tumor cells. The consensus clustering algorithm yielded two molecular subtypes, with cluster 2 being associated with advanced tumor stages and an abundance of infiltrated immune cells. We identified 17 prognostic genes through Cox and LASSO regression models and used them to construct a prognostic model, the efficacy of which was verified in multiple cohorts. Furthermore, we investigated the role of MT2A, one of our hub genes, in ccRCC carcinogenesis, and found it to regulate proliferation and migration of malignant cells.

However, few methods have met the need to recognize and quantify the underlying cellular programs that determine the specialization and differentiation of the cell types.In this study, we present scGEM, a nested tree-structured nonparametric Bayesian model, to reveal the gene co-expression modules (GEMs) reflecting transcriptome processes in single cells.We show that scGEM can discover shared and specialized transcriptome signals across different cell types using peripheral blood mononuclear single cells and early brain development single cells. scGEM outperformed other methods in perplexity and topic coherence (p< 0.001) on our simulation data. Larger datasets, deeper trees and pre-trained models are shown to be positively associated with better scGEM performance. The GEMs obtained from triple-negative breast cancer single cells exhibited better correlations with lymphocyte infiltration (p= 0.009) and the cell cycle (p< 0.001) than other methods in additional validation on the bulk RNAseq dataset.Altogether, we demonstrate that scGEM can be used to model the hidden cellular functions of single cells, thereby unveiling the specialization and generalization of transcriptomic programs across different types of cells."

The imputation performance of an autoencoder relies on both the neural network architecture and the hyperparameter choice. So far, literature in the single-cell field lacks a formal discussion on how to design the neural network and choose the hyperparameters. Here, we conducted an empirical study to answer this question. Our study used many real and simulated scRNA-seq datasets to examine the impacts of the neural network architecture, the activation function, and the regularization strategy on imputation accuracy and downstream analyses. Our results show that (i) deeper and narrower autoencoders generally lead to better imputation performance; (ii) the sigmoid and tanh activation functions consistently outperform other commonly used functions including ReLU; (iii) regularization improves the accuracy of imputation and downstream cell clustering and DE gene analyses. Notably, our results differ from common practices in the computer vision field regarding the activation function and the regularization strategy. Overall, our study offers practical guidance on how to optimize the autoencoder design for scRNA-seq data imputation.© 2023 The Authors."
"761",37848673,"Ferroptosis: underlying mechanisms and involvement in neurodegenerative diseases.","Apoptosis","Ferroptosis, a mode of cell death that was recently identified in 2012, is driven by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation and distinct from other mechanisms of cell death such as autophagy and apoptosis. Ferroptosis has the unique features of disruptions in iron equilibrium, iron-induced lipid peroxidation, and the accumulation of glutamate-induced cellular toxicity. The regulation of ferroptosis mainly involves the iron, lipid, and amino acid metabolic pathways, which are controlled by system Xc-, voltage-dependent anion channels, p53 and other pathways. Neurodegenerative diseases involve gradual neuronal loss predominantly within the central nervous system and are categorized into both sporadic and rare hereditary disorders. These diseases result in the progressive decline of specific neuron populations and their interconnections. Recent investigations have revealed a strong correlation between the manifestation and progression of neurodegenerative diseases and ferroptosis. The pharmacological modulation of ferroptosis, whether by induction or inhibition, exhibits promising prospects for therapeutic interventions for these diseases. This review aims to examine the literature on ferroptosis and its implications in various neurodegenerative diseases. We hope to offer novel insights into the potential therapies targeting ferroptosis in central nervous system neurodegenerative diseases. However, there are still limitations of this review. First, despite our efforts to maintain objectivity during our analysis, this review does not cover all the studies on ferroptosis and neurodegenerative diseases. Second, cell death in neurodegenerative diseases is not solely caused by ferroptosis. Future research should focus on the interplay of different cell death mechanisms to better elucidate the specific disease pathogenesis.© 2023.

To induce this lineage, we use a combination of Bone Morphogenetic Protein-4 (BMP4) and the WNT inhibitor IWP2. This protocol has enabled us to obtain a pure population of trophectoderm (TE)-like cells that could subsequently be terminally differentiated into syncytiotrophoblasts (STB) and extravillous trophoblasts (EVT). However, the resulting TE-like cells could only be terminally differentiated to a variable mixture of STB and EVT, with a bias toward the STB lineage. Recently, methods have been developed for derivation and culture of self-renewing human trophoblast stem cells (TSC) from human embryos and early gestation placental tissues. These primary TSCs were further able to differentiate into either STB or EVT with high efficiency using the lineage specific differentiation protocols. Based partly on these protocols, we have developed methods for establishing self-renewing TSC-like cells from PSC, and for efficient lineage-specific terminal differentiation.

Here by simultaneously investigating the chromatin accessibility, DNA methylome and transcriptome landscapes using the modified single-cell chromatin overall omic-scale landscape sequencing approach, we revealed that the transcriptional changes throughout human spermatogenesis were correlated with chromatin accessibility changes. In particular, we identified a set of transcription factors and cis elements with potential functions. A round of DNA demethylation was uncovered upon meiosis initiation in human spermatogenesis, which was associated with male meiotic recombination and conserved between human and mouse. Aberrant DNA hypermethylation could be detected in leptotene spermatocytes of certain nonobstructive azoospermia patients. Functionally, the intervention of DNA demethylation affected male meiotic recombination and fertility. Our work provides multi-omics landscapes of human spermatogenesis at single-cell resolution and offers insights into the association between DNA demethylation and male meiotic recombination.© 2023.

We hypothesized that the molecular profile of patients with PV and ET is dynamic throughout the disease.In this study, we performed a 37-gene targeted next-generation sequencing panel on the DNA samples collected from 49 study participants in two-time points, separated by 78-141 months. We identified 78 variants across 37 analyzed genes in the study population.By analyzing the change in variant allele frequencies and revealing the acquisition of new mutations during the disease, we confirmed the dynamic nature of the molecular profile of patients with PV and ET. We found connections between specific variants with the development of secondary myelofibrosis, thrombotic events, and response to treatment. We confronted our results with existing conventional and mutation-enhanced prognostic systems, showing the limited utility of available prognostic tools.The results of this study underline the significance of repeated molecular testing in patients with PV and ET and indicate the need for further research within this field to better understand the disease and improve available prognostic tools.Copyright © 2023 Sobieralski, Wasąg, Leszczyńska, Żuk and Bieniaszewska."

Concerningly, there is a lack of caution provided by medical providers to pregnant individuals as to the impact the use of cannabinoids could have on the developing fetus. Research continues in both the preclinical and clinical areas, and is severely needed, as the potency of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive component of cannabis, has increased dramatically since the initial studies were completed. Thus far, clinical studies raise compelling evidence for short term memory deficits, impulse control issues, and attention deficiencies following prenatal cannabinoid exposure (PCE). These changes may be mediated through epigenetic modifications that not only impact the current offspring but could carry forward to future generations. While additional studies are needed, a pregnancy pause from cannabinoid products should be strongly recommended by providers to ensure the optimal health and well-being of our future generations.© 2023 Lin, Dent, Davies, Dominguez, Cioffredi, McLemore and Maxwell."

However, how much and which ensemble learning techniques are useful in deep learning-based pipelines for pancreas computed tomography (CT) image classification is a challenge. Ensemble approaches are the most advanced solution to many machine learning problems. These techniques entail training multiple models and combining their predictions to improve the predictive performance of a single model. This article introduces the idea of Stacked Ensemble Deep Learning (SEDL), a pipeline for classifying pancreas CT medical images. The weak learners are Inception V3, VGG16, and ResNet34, and we employed a stacking ensemble. By combining the first-level predictions, an input train set for XGBoost, the ensemble model at the second level of prediction, is created. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), employed as a strong learner, will make the final classification. Our findings showed that SEDL performed better, with a 98.8% ensemble accuracy, after some adjustments to the hyperparameters. The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) public access dataset consists of 80 pancreas CT scans with a resolution of 512 * 512 pixels, from 53 male and 27 female subjects. A sample of two hundred and twenty-two images was used for training and testing data. We concluded that implementing the SEDL technique is an effective way to strengthen the robustness and increase the performance of the pipeline for classifying pancreas CT medical images. Interestingly, grouping like-minded or talented learners does not make a difference.Copyright © 2023 Bakasa and Viriri."

This study aimed to develop a tool to identify the risk of liver fibrosis after cholecystectomy. For this purpose, the extreme gradient boosting (XGB) algorithm was used to construct an effective predictive model. The factors associated with a better predictive method were platelet level, followed by dyslipidaemia and type-2 diabetes (T2DM). Compared to other ML methods, our proposed method, XGB, achieved higher accuracy values. The XGB method had the highest balanced accuracy (93.16%). XGB outperformed KNN in accuracy (93.16% vs. 84.45%) and AUC (0.92 vs. 0.84).

This study aims to describe and compare the body composition profiles between metabolic healthy (MH) and metabolic unhealthy (MU) phenotype in normal and obesity population in China, and to explore the predictive ability of body composition indices to distinguish MU by generating machine learning algorithms.A cross-sectional study was conducted and the subjects who came to the hospital to receive a health examination were enrolled. Body composition was assessed using bioelectrical impedance analyser. A model generator with a gradient-boosting tree algorithm (LightGBM) combined with the SHapley Additive exPlanations method was adapted to train and interpret the model. Receiver-operating characteristic curves were used to analyze the predictive value.We found the significant difference in body composition parameters between the metabolic healthy normal weight (MHNW), metabolic healthy obesity (MHO), metabolic unhealthy normal weight (MUNW) and metabolic unhealthy obesity (MUO) individuals, especially among the MHNW, MUNW and MUO phenotype. MHNW phenotype had significantly lower whole fat mass (FM), trunk FM and trunk free fat mass (FFM), and had significantly lower visceral fat areas compared to MUNW and MUO phenotype, respectively. The bioimpedance phase angle, waist-hip ratio (WHR) and free fat mass index (FFMI) were found to be remarkably lower in MHNW than in MUNW and MUO groups, and lower in MHO than in MUO group. For predictive analysis, the LightGBM-based model identified 32 status-predicting features for MUNW with MHNW group as the reference, MUO with MHO as the reference and MUO with MHNW as the reference, achieved high discriminative power, with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.842 [0.658, 1.000] for MUNW vs. MHNW, 0.746 [0.599, 0.893] for MUO vs. MHO and 0.968 [0.968, 1.000] for MUO and MHNW, respectively.

Melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer arising from pigment-producing melanocytes and is often associated with the dysregulation of epigenetic factors targeting histones. Here, we demonstrate that VprBP is highly expressed and phosphorylates threonine 120 (T120) on histone H2A to drive the transcriptional inactivation of growth-regulatory genes in melanoma cells. As is the case for its epigenetic function in other types of cancers, VprBP acts to induce a gene silencing program dependent on H2AT120 phosphorylation (H2AT120p). The significance of VprBP-mediated H2AT120p is further underscored by the fact that VprBP knockdown- or VprBP inhibitor-induced lockage of H2AT120p mitigates melanoma tumor growth in xenograft models. Collectively, our results establish VprBP-mediated H2AT120p as a key epigenetic signal for melanomagenesis and suggest the therapeutic potential of targeting VprBP kinase activity for effective melanoma treatment."
"771",37781386,NA,NA,"C-reactive protein (CRP) is an evolutionary highly conserved protein. Like humans, CRP acts as a major acute phase protein in pigs. WhileCRPregulatory mechanisms have been extensively studied in humans, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that control pigCRPgene expression. The main goal of the present work was to study the regulatory mechanisms and identify functional genetic variants regulatingCRPgene expression and CRP blood levels in pigs. The characterization of the porcineCRPproximal promoter region revealed a high level of conservation with both cow and human promoters, sharing binding sites for transcription factors required forCRPexpression. Through genome-wide association studies and fine mapping, the most associated variants with both mRNA and protein CRP levels were localized in a genomic region 39.3 kb upstream ofCRP. Further study of the region revealed a highly conserved putative enhancer that contains binding sites for several transcriptional regulators such as STAT3, NF-kB or C/EBP-β. Luciferase reporter assays showed the necessity of this enhancer-promoter interaction for the acute phase induction ofCRPexpression in liver, where differences in the enhancer sequences significantly modifiedCRPactivity. The associated polymorphisms disrupted the putative binding sites for HNF4α and FOXA2 transcription factors. The high correlation betweenHNF4αandCRPexpression levels suggest the participation of HNF4α in the regulatory mechanism of porcineCRPexpression through the modification of its binding site in liver.

Prevalence is higher among families of low socioeconomic position (SEP) and systematic reviews have identified relevant factors, but have not quantified their relative importance to SEP differentials. This paper examines the relative importance of different factors to Body Mass Index (BMI) and obesity trajectories from age 9 to age 17/18.Multi-level models of child BMI/obesity risk trajectory by maternal education were conducted using a nationally representative cohort of children born in Ireland in 1998 and aged 9 at baseline (N = 8568), with follow-up at 13 and 17/18 years (88% and 73% response rate respectively). Models were stratified by sex and both time-varying (e.g. child physical activity, diet, sedentary activity) and time-invariant (e.g. early life) factors were tested.Significant inverse gradients in BMI and obesity risk by level of maternal education were present across both sexes and at each age; unadjusted absolute differentials in obesity risk between highest/lowest education groups increased by 56% for males and 42% for females between age 9 and 17/18. Early life factors accounted for 22% of the differential in obesity risk between the lowest and highest education groups among males at age 9, falling to 13% at 17/18. Among females the proportion fell from 33 to 23%. Unadjusted absolute high/low maternal education group differentials in BMI were 7.5 times higher among males and 11 times higher among females at 17/18 than at age 9.Given the importance of early life exposures to subsequent differentials in BMI and obesity risk our findings suggest that policy makers should focus resources on primary prevention during the prenatal and early life period if they wish to reduce the prevalence of child and adolescent obesity.© 2023 The Authors."

Non-genetic information is considered to be a key element to explain the adaptation of wild species to environmental constraints because it lies at the root of the transgenerational transmission of environmental effects. The ""transmissibility model"" was proposed several years ago to better predict the transmissible potential of each animal by taking these diverse sources of inheritance into account in a global transmissible potential. We propose to improve this model to account for the influence of the environment on the global transmissible potential as well. This extension of the transmissibility model is the ""transmissibility model with environment"" that considers a covariance between transmissibility samplings of animals sharing the same environment. The null hypothesis of ""no transmitted environmental effect"" can be tested by comparing the two models using a likelihood ratio test (LRT).We performed simulations that mimicked an experimental design consisting of two lines of animals with one exposed to a particular environment at a given generation. This enabled us to evaluate the performances of the transmissibility model with environment so as to detect and quantify transgenerational transmitted environmental effects. The power and the realized type I error of the LRT were compared to those of a T-test comparing the phenotype of the two lines, three generations after the environmental exposure for different sets of parameters. The power of the LRT ranged from 45 to 94%, whereas that of the T-test was always lower than 26%. In addition, the realized type I error of the T-test was 15% and that of the LRT was 5%, as expected. Variances, the covariance between transmissibility samplings, and path coefficients of transmission estimated with the transmissibility model with environment were close to their true values for all sets of parameters.The transmissibility model with environment is effective in modeling vertical transmission of environmental effects.© 2023. ’Institut National de Recherche en Agriculture, Alimentation et Environnement (INRAE)."

The pheromone 2,5-dimethylpyrazine (2,5-DMP), which is released by female mice in crowded conditions, induced aversion, glucocorticoid elevation and, when chronic, resulted in reproductive and immune suppression. 2,5-DMP olfaction induced genome destabilization in bone marrow cells in a stress-dependent manner, providing a plausible mechanism for crowding-induced immune dysfunction. Interestingly, the genome-destabilizing effect of 2,5-DMP was comparable to a potent mouse stressor (immobilization), and both stressors led to correlated expression changes in genes regulating cellular stress response. Thus, our findings demonstrate that, in mice, the health effects of crowding may be explained at least in part by chemosignals and also propose a significant role of stress and genome destabilization in the emergence of crowding effects.© 2023.

To date, there is no approved pharmacotherapy for the treatment of NAFLD, and necessary lifestyle changes such as weight loss, diet, and exercise are usually not sufficient to manage this disease. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have a significantly higher risk of developing NAFLD and vice versa. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are antidiabetic agents that have recently been approved for two other indications: chronic kidney disease and heart failure in diabetics and non-diabetics. They are also emerging as promising new agents for NAFLD treatment, as they have shown beneficial effects on hepatic inflammation, steatosis, and fibrosis. Studies in animals have reported favorable effects of SGLT2 inhibitors, and studies in patients also found positive effects on body mass index (BMI), insulin resistance, glucose levels, liver enzymes, apoptosis, and transcription factors. There are some theories regarding how SGLT2 inhibitors affect the liver, but the exact mechanism is not yet fully understood. Therefore, biomarkers to evaluate underlying mechanisms of action of SGLT2 inhibitors on the liver have now been scrutinized to assess their potential as a future in-label therapy for NAFLD. In addition, finding suitable non-invasive biomarkers could be helpful in clinical practice for the early detection of NAFLD in patients. This is crucial for a positive disease outcome. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the most recent findings on the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on NAFLD biomarkers and the potential of SGLT2 inhibitors to successfully treat NAFLD."

The post-translational modifications (PTMs) are functionally relevant and strengthen the link between metabolism and cellular functions. Lysine crotonylation is a newly identified PTM, the function of which in PCOS has not yet been reported. To explore the molecular mechanisms of crotonylation involved in the abnormalities of metabolic homeostasis and oocyte maturation in PCOS, by using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, we constructed a comprehensive map of crotonylation modifications in ovarian tissue of PCOS-like mouse model established by dehydroepiandrosterone induction. The crotonylation levels of proteins involved in metabolic processes were significantly decreased in PCOS ovaries compared to control samples. Further investigation showed that decrotonylation of Lon protease 1 (LONP1) at lysine 390 was associated with mitochondrial dysfunction in PCOS. Moreover, LONP1 crotonylation levels in PCOS were correlated with ovarian tissue oxidative stress levels, androgen levels, and oocyte development. Consistently, down-regulation of LONP1 and LONP1 crotonylation levels were also observed in the blood samples of PCOS patients. Collectively, our study revealed a mechanism by which the decrotonylation of LONP1 may attenuate its activity and alter follicular microenvironment to affect oocyte maturation in PCOS.© 2023 The Authors.

Several evidences suggest that the accumulation of epigenetic alterations is one of the key driving forces triggering aberrant cellular proliferation, invasion, metastasis and chemoresistance pathways. Recently a novel class of histone ""non-enzymatic covalent modifications"" (NECMs), correlating epigenome landscape and metabolic rewiring, have been described. These modifications are tightly related to cell metabolic fitness and are able to impair chromatin architecture. During metabolic reprogramming, the high metabolic flux induces the accumulation of metabolic intermediate and/or by-products able to react with histone tails altering epigenome homeostasis. The accumulation of histone NECMs is a damaging condition that cancer cells counteracts by overexpressing peculiar ""eraser"" enzymes capable of removing these modifications preserving histones architecture. In this review we explored the well-established NECMs, emphasizing the role of their corresponding eraser enzymes. Additionally, we provide a parterre of drugs aiming to target those eraser enzymes with the intent to propose novel routes of personalized medicine based on the identification of epi-biomarkers which might be selectively targeted for therapy.

Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) sequencing has recently shown potential as a non-invasive strategy for monitoring cancer. There is an opportunity for high-yield cancer early detection in HCS. To assess clinical validity of cfDNA in individuals with HCS, representatives from eight genetics centers from across Canada founded the CHARM (cfDNA in Hereditary and High-Risk Malignancies) Consortium in 2017. In this perspective, we discuss operationalization of this consortium and early data emerging from the most common and well-characterized HCSs: hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, Lynch syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and Neurofibromatosis type 1. We identify opportunities for the incorporation of cfDNA sequencing into surveillance protocols; these opportunities are backed by examples of earlier cancer detection efficacy in HCSs from the CHARM Consortium. We seek to establish a paradigm shift in early cancer surveillance in individuals with HCSs, away from highly centralized, regimented medical screening visits and toward more accessible, frequent, and proactive care for these high-risk individuals.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

"782",37745752,"Exploring Circulating Tumor DNA (CtDNA) and Its Role in Early Detection of Cancer: A Systematic Review.","Cureus","There is a significant increase in the need for an efficient screening method that might identify cancer at an early stage and could improve patients' long-term survival due to the continued rise in cancer incidence and associated mortality. One such effort involved using circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) as a rescue agent for a non-invasive blood test that may identify many tumors. A tumor marker called ctDNA is created by cells with the same DNA alterations. Due to its shorter half-life, it may be useful for both early cancer detection and real-time monitoring of tumor development, therapeutic response, and tumor outcomes. We obtained 156 papers from PUBMED using the MeSH approach in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) criteria and ten articles from additional online resources. After removing articles with irrelevant titles and screening the abstract and full text of the articles that contained information unrelated to or not specific to the title query using inclusion and exclusion criteria, 18 out of 166 articles were chosen for the quality check. Fourteen medium to high-quality papers were chosen out of the 18 publications to be included in the study design. The reviewed literature showed no significant utility of ctDNA in detecting early-stage tumors of size less than 1 cm diameter. Still, the ideal screening test would require the assay to detect a size <5 mm tumor, which is nearly impossible with the current data. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay ranged from 69% to 98% and 99%, respectively. Furthermore, CancerSEEK achieves tumor origin localization in 83% of cases, while targeted error correction sequencing (TEC-Seq) assays demonstrate a cancer detection rate ranging from 59% to 71%, depending on the type of cancer. However, it could be of great value as a prognostic indicator, and the levels are associated with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates, wherein the positive detection of ctDNA is associated with worse OS compared to the tumors detected through standard procedures, with an odds ratio (OS) of 4.83. We conclude that ctDNA could be better applied in cancer patients for prognosis, disease progression monitoring, and treatment outcomes compared to its use in early cancer detection. Due to its specific feature of recognizing the tumor-related mutations, it could be implemented as a supplemental tool to assess the nature of the tumor, grade, and size of the tumor and for predicting the outcomes by pre-operative and post-operative evaluation of the tumor marker, ctDNA, and thereby estimating PFS and OS depending on the level of marker present. A vast amount of research is required in early detection to determine the sensitivity, specificity, false positive rates, and false negative rates in evaluating its true potential as a screening tool. Even if the test could detect the mutations, an extensive workup for the search of tumor is required as the assay could only detect but cannot localize the disease. Establishing the clinical validity and utility of ctDNA is imperative for its implementation in future clinical practice.Copyright © 2023, Bittla et al."

We hypothesized that a panel of methylated DNA markers (MDMs) found in HPV(+) cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) will have similar discrimination in HPV(+)OPSCC tissues.Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues were obtained from patients with primary HPV(+)OPSCC or HPV(+)CSCC; control tissues included normal oropharynx palatine tonsil (NOP) and cervix (NCS). Using a methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction, 21 previously validated cervical MDMs were evaluated on tissue-extracted DNA. Discrimination between case and control cervical and oropharynx tissue was assessed using area under the curve (AUC).34 HPV(+)OPSCC, 36 HPV(+)CSCC, 26 NOP, and 24 NCS patients met inclusion criteria. Within HPV(+)CSCC, 18/21 (86%) of MDMs achieved an AUC ≥ 0.9 and all MDMs exhibited better than chance classifications relative to control cervical tissue (all p < 0.001). In contrast, within HPV(+)OPSCC only 5/21 (24%) MDMs achieved an AUC ≥ 0.90 but 19/21 (90%) exhibited better than chance classifications relative to control tonsil tissue (all p < 0.001). Overall, 13/21 MDMs had statistically significant lower AUCs in the oropharyngeal cohort compared to the cervical cohort, and only 1 MDM exhibited a statistically significant increase in AUC.Previously validated MDMs exhibited robust performance in independent HPV(+)CSCC patients. However, most of these MDMs exhibited higher discrimination for HPV(+)CSCC than for HPV(+)OPSCC. This suggests that each SCC subtype requires a unique set of MDMs for optimal discrimination. Future studies are necessary to establish an MDM panel for HPV(+)OPSCC.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Metabolome-wide association studies were performed for PBB-153 separately for each generation andΣPCB(PCB-118, PCB-138, PCB-153, and PCB-180) in the two generations combined, as both had direct PCB exposure. Metabolite and metabolic pathway alterations were evaluated following a well-established untargeted HRM workflow.Mean levels were1.75 ng/mL[standard deviation (SD): 13.9] for PBB-153 and1.04 ng/mL(SD: 0.788) forΣPCB. Sixty-two and 26 metabolic features were significantly associated with PBB-153 in F0 and F1 [false discovery rate (FDR)p<0.2], respectively. There were 2,861 features associated withΣPCB(FDRp<0.2). Metabolic pathway enrichment analysis using a bioinformatics tool revealed perturbations associated withΣPCBin numerous oxidative stress and inflammation pathways (e.g., carnitine shuttle, glycosphingolipid, and vitamin B9 metabolism). Metabolic perturbations associated with PBB-153 in F0 were related to oxidative stress (e.g., pentose phosphate and vitamin C metabolism) and in F1 were related to energy production (e.g., pyrimidine, amino sugars, and lysine metabolism). Using authentic chemical standards, we confirmed the chemical identity of 29 metabolites associated withΣPCBlevels (level 1 evidence).Our results demonstrate that serum PBB-153 is associated with alterations in inflammation and oxidative stress-related pathways, which differed when stratified by generation. We also found thatΣPCBwas associated with the downregulation of important neurotransmitters, serotonin, and 4-aminobutanoate. These findings provide novel insights for future investigations of molecular mechanisms underlying PBB and PCB exposure on health. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP12657."
"786",37802023,"An intrinsically disordered region controlling condensation of a circadian clock component and rhythmic transcription in the liver.","Mol Cell","Circadian gene transcription is fundamental to metabolic physiology. Here we report that the nuclear receptor REV-ERBα, a repressive component of the molecular clock, forms circadian condensates in the nuclei of mouse liver. These condensates are dictated by an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) located in the protein's hinge region which specifically concentrates nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (NCOR1) at the genome. IDR deletion diminishes the recruitment of NCOR1 and disrupts rhythmic gene transcription in vivo. REV-ERBα condensates are located at high-order transcriptional repressive hubs in the liver genome that are highly correlated with circadian gene repression. Deletion of the IDR disrupts transcriptional repressive hubs and diminishes silencing of target genes by REV-ERBα. This work demonstrates physiological circadian protein condensates containing REV-ERBα whose IDR is required for hub formation and the control of rhythmic gene expression.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

"787",37699658,"Chromatin loop dynamics during cellular differentiation are associated with changes to both anchor and internal regulatory features.","Genome Res","Three-dimensional (3D) chromatin structure has been shown to play a role in regulating gene transcription during biological transitions. Although our understanding of loop formation and maintenance is rapidly improving, much less is known about the mechanisms driving changes in looping and the impact of differential looping on gene transcription. One limitation has been a lack of well-powered differential looping data sets. To address this, we conducted a deeply sequenced Hi-C time course of megakaryocyte development comprising four biological replicates and 6 billion reads per time point. Statistical analysis revealed 1503 differential loops. Gained loop anchors were enriched for AP-1 occupancy and were characterized by large increases in histone H3K27ac (over 11-fold) but relatively small increases in CTCF and RAD21 binding (1.26- and 1.23-fold, respectively). Linear modeling revealed that changes in histone H3K27ac, chromatin accessibility, and JUN binding were better correlated with changes in looping than RAD21 and almost as well correlated as CTCF. Changes to epigenetic features between-rather than at-boundaries were highly predictive of changes in looping. Together these data suggest that although CTCF and RAD21 may be the core machinery dictating where loops form, other features (both at the anchors and within the loop boundaries) may play a larger role than previously anticipated in determining the relative loop strength across cell types and conditions.© 2023 Bond et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press."

The Population Health Information Research Infrastructure (PHIRI) project aimed to promote the exchange of population data in Europe and included a Use Case on perinatal health.Objective: To develop and test a protocol for federated analysis of population birth data in Europe.Methods:The Euro-Peristat network with participants from 31 countries developed a Common Data Model (CDM) and R scripts to exchange and analyse aggregated data on perinatal indicators. Building on recommended Euro-Peristat indicators, complemented by a three-round consensus process, the network specified variables for a CDM and common outputs. The protocol was tested using routine birth data for 2015 to 2020; a survey was conducted assessing data provider experiences and opinions.Results:The CDM included 17 core data items for the testing phase and 18 for a future expanded phase. 28 countries and the four UK nations created individual person-level databases and ran R scripts to produce anonymous aggregate tables. Seven had all core items, 17 had 13-16, while eight had ≤12. Limitations were not having all items in the same database, required for this protocol. Infant death and mode of birth were most frequently missing. Countries took from under a day to several weeks to set up the CDM, after which the protocol was easy and quick to use.Conclusion:This open-source protocol enables rapid production and analysis of perinatal indicators and constitutes a roadmap for a sustainable European information system. It also provides minimum standards for improving national data systems and can be used in other countries to facilitate comparison of perinatal indicators.Copyright: © 2023 Zeitlin J et al."

Diagnosis can be challenging and there are large knowledge gaps regarding its etiology, though studies suggest an interplay of genetic and environmental factors involving epigenetic mechanisms. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) show promise as biomarkers of human pathology and novel therapies, and here we aimed to identify blood miRNAs associated with traits of ADHD as possible biomarker candidates and further explore their biological relevance.Our study population consisted of 1126 children (aged 5-12 years, 46% female) from the Human Early Life Exposome study, a study spanning six ongoing population-based European birth cohorts. Expression profiles of miRNAs in whole blood samples were quantified by microarray and tested for association with ADHD-related measures of behavior and neuropsychological functions from questionnaires (Conner's Rating Scale and Child Behavior Checklist) and computer-based tests (the N-back task and Attention Network Test).We identified 29 miRNAs significantly associated (false discovery rate < .05) with the Conner's questionnaire-rated trait hyperactivity, 15 of which have been linked to ADHD in previous studies. Investigation into their biological relevance revealed involvement in several pathways related to neurodevelopment and function, as well as being linked with other neurodevelopmental or psychiatric disorders known to overlap with ADHD both in symptomology, genetic risk, and co-occurrence, such as autism spectrum disorder or schizophrenia. An additional three miRNAs were significantly associated with Conner's-rated inattention. No associations were found with questionnaire-rated total ADHD index or with computer-based tests.The large overlap of our hyperactivity-associated miRNAs with previous studies on ADHD is intriguing and warrant further investigation. Though this study should be considered explorative and preliminary, these findings contribute towards identifying a set of miRNAs for use as blood-based biomarkers to aid in earlier and easier ADHD diagnosis.© 2023.

Therefore, a pilot study was carried out by means of the measurement of lead in umbilical cord blood by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) including 69 newborns from the Mexican state capital of Guanajuato, Guanajuato City, where the use of glazed clay is still widespread. Lifestyle and sociodemographic data were collected by interviewing the participating mothers. Hematological parameters and the anthropometry of the newborns and their mothers were analyzed; likewise, the G177C polymorphism in the ALAD gene was genotyped by PCR-RFLP as a marker of genetic vulnerability to lead. The geometric mean of lead in umbilical cord blood was 0.7 µg/dL (< limit of detection = 0.01-28.22). Boys presented higher values than girls (p = 0.03). Only 5.8% of these were above the safety value of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of 3.5 µg/dL. Correlations among lead concentrations, maternal age, weeks of gestation, newborn anthropometry, and hematological parameters were not found; however, the participating mothers who reported using glazed ceramics for cooking or storing food had the highest cord-blood lead concentrations (p = 0.04). Regarding genotyping, 97% had ALAD 1, while 3% had ALAD 1, 2; unfortunately, the sample size did not allow analysis of genetic vulnerability to lead. The preparation and conservation of food in handcrafted clay pottery increased the risk of having cord-blood lead values higher than those recommended by the CDC of 3.5 µg/dL (OR = 5; 95% CI:1.3-23; p = 0.01).

However, there is a limited number of studies that have attempted to subtype cancer by combining different types of stem cell signatures.In this study, 10,323 cancer specimens from 33 TCGA cancer types were clustered based on the enrichment scores of six stemness gene sets, representing two types of stem cell backgrounds: embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs).We identified four subtypes of pan-cancer, termed StC1, StC2, StC3 and StC4, which displayed distinct molecular and clinical features, including stemness, genome integrity, intratumor heterogeneity, methylation levels, tumor microenvironment, tumor progression, responses to chemotherapy and immunotherapy, and survival prognosis. Importantly, this subtyping method for pan-cancer is reproducible at the protein level.Our findings indicate that the ESC signature is an adverse prognostic factor in cancer, while the HSC signature and ratio of HSC/ESC signatures are positive prognostic factors.

This study aimed to characterize and elucidate the immunosuppressive phenotype of STC in lung adenocarcinoma by employing single-cell and bulk transcriptomics, as well as serum proteomics profiling. We identified senescence-related genes specific to tumors and identified Cluster10 of STC as the immunomodulatory subtype. Cluster10 exhibited a distinct secretome dominated by cytokines such as CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL8 and showed activation of transcription factors associated with cytokine secretion, including NFKB1, RELA, and STAT3. Notably, Cluster10 demonstrated the highest degree of intercellular communication among all cell types, with interactions as LGALS9-TIM3 and MIF-CD74. Furthermore, Cluster10 showed significant associations with poor prognosis and diminished response to immunotherapy.

Early diagnosis and treatment are critical for improving patient outcomes, and the use of liquid biopsies has emerged as a promising approach for cancer detection and monitoring. Traditionally, cancer diagnosis has relied on invasive tissue biopsies, the collection of which can prove challenging for patients and the results of which may not always provide accurate results due to tumor heterogeneity. Liquid biopsies have gained increasing attention as they provide a non-invasive and accessible source of cancer biomarkers, which can be used to diagnose cancer, monitor treatment response, and detect relapse. The integration of -omics technologies, such as proteomics, genomics, and metabolomics, has further enhanced the capabilities of liquid biopsies by introducing precision oncology and enabling the tailoring of treatment for individual patients based on their unique tumor biology.

Some of these methods are based on the assumption that the candidate drug should have a reversal effect on disease-associated genes. However, such methods are not applicable in the case that there is limited overlap between disease-related genes and drug-perturbed genes. In this study, we proposed a novelDrugRepurposing method based on theInhibitionEffect on gene regulatory network (DRIE) to identify potential drugs for cancer treatment. DRIE integrated gene expression profile and gene regulatory network to calculate inhibition score by using the shortest path in the disease-specific network. The results on eleven datasets indicated the superior performance of DRIE when compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Case studies showed that our method effectively discovered novel drug-disease associations. Our findings demonstrated that the top-ranked drug candidates had been already validated by CTD database. Additionally, it clearly identified potential agents for three cancers (colorectal, breast, and lung cancer), which was beneficial when annotating drug-disease relationships in the CTD.

Editing the strongest ASoC SNP, rs2027349, nearvacuolar protein sorting 45 homolog(VPS45) alters the expression ofVPS45, lncRNAAC244033.2, and a distal gene,C1orf54.Notably, the transcriptomic changes in neurons are associated with SZ and other neuropsychiatric disorders. Neurons carrying the risk allele exhibit increased dendritic complexity and hyperactivity. Interestingly, individual/combinatorial gene knockdown shows that these genes alter cellular phenotypes in a non-additive synergistic manner.

The main local mechanisms comprise metabolic (lipid) signalling, altered mitochondrial metabolism with oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress and local inflammation. While the role of endocrine dysregulation in T2DM pathogenesis is well established, other forms of inter-organ crosstalk deserve closer investigation to better understand the multifactorial transition from normoglycaemia to hyperglycaemia. This narrative Review addresses the impact of certain tissue-specific messenger systems, such as metabolites, peptides and proteins and microRNAs, their secretion patterns and possible alternative transport mechanisms, such as extracellular vesicles (exosomes). The focus is on the effects of these messengers on distant organs during the development of T2DM and progression to its complications. Starting from the adipose tissue as a major organ relevant to T2DM pathophysiology, the discussion is expanded to other key tissues, such as skeletal muscle, liver, the endocrine pancreas and the intestine. Subsequently, this Review also sheds light on the potential of multimarker panels derived from these biomarkers and related multi-omics for the prediction of risk and progression of T2DM, novel diabetes mellitus subtypes and/or endotypes and T2DM-related complications.© 2023.

Our variant-level exome-wide association study identified 5,433 rare genotype-protein associations, of which 81% were undetected in a previous genome-wide association study of the same cohort5. We then looked at aggregate signals using gene-level collapsing analysis, which revealed 1,962 gene-protein associations. Of the 691 gene-level signals from protein-truncating variants, 99.4% were associated with decreased protein levels. STAB1 and STAB2, encoding scavenger receptors involved in plasma protein clearance, emerged as pleiotropic loci, with 77 and 41 protein associations, respectively. We demonstrate the utility of our publicly accessible resource through several applications. These include detailing an allelic series in NLRC4, identifying potential biomarkers for a fatty liver disease-associated variant in HSD17B13 and bolstering phenome-wide association studies by integrating protein quantitative trait loci with protein-truncating variants in collapsing analyses.

Genetic associations with CRC were obtained from a large-scale GWAS meta-analysis (16,871 cases and 26,328 controls), the FinnGen cohort (4957 cases and 304,197 controls), and the UK Biobank (9276 cases and 477,069 controls). Colocalization and summary-data-based MR (SMR) analyses were performed sequentially to verify the causal role of candidate proteins. Single cell-type expression analysis, protein-protein interaction (PPI), and druggability evaluation were further conducted to detect the specific cell type with enrichment expression and prioritize potential therapeutic targets.Collectively, genetically predicted levels of 13 proteins were associated with CRC risk. Elevated levels of two proteins (GREM1, CHRDL2) and decreased levels of 11 proteins were associated with an increased risk of CRC, among which four (GREM1, CLSTN3, CSF2RA, CD86) were prioritized with the most convincing evidence. These protein-coding genes are mainly expressed in tissue stem cells, epithelial cells, and monocytes in colon tumor tissue. Two interactive pairs of proteins (GREM1 and CHRDL2; MMP2 and TIMP2) were identified to be involved in osteoclast differentiation and tumorigenesis pathways; four proteins (POLR2F, CSF2RA, CD86, MMP2) have been targeted for drug development on autoimmune diseases and other cancers, with the potentials of being repurposed as therapeutic targets for CRC.This study identified several protein biomarkers to be associated with CRC risk and provided new insights into the etiology and promising targets for the development of screening biomarkers and therapeutic drugs for CRC.© 2023.

Here we investigate single nucleus transcriptomics (snRNA-seq) and epigenomics (snATAC-seq) in postmortem motor and frontal cortices from C9-ALS, C9-FTD, and control donors. C9-ALS donors present pervasive alterations of gene expression with concordant changes in chromatin accessibility and histone modifications. The greatest alterations occur in upper and deep layer excitatory neurons, as well as in astrocytes. In neurons, the changes imply an increase in proteostasis, metabolism, and protein expression pathways, alongside a decrease in neuronal function. In astrocytes, the alterations suggest activation and structural remodeling. Conversely, C9-FTD donors have fewer high-quality neuronal nuclei in the frontal cortex and numerous gene expression changes in glial cells. These findings highlight a context-dependent molecular disruption in C9-ALS and C9-FTD, indicating unique effects across cell types, brain regions, and diseases.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have mapped > 90% of CVD-associated variants within the non-coding genome, which can alter the function of regulatory proteins, like transcription factors (TFs). However, due to the overwhelming number of GWAS single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (>500,000), prioritizing variants for in vitro analysis remains challenging. In this work, we implemented a computational approach that considers support vector machine (SVM)-based TF binding site classification and cardiac expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis to identify and prioritize potential CVD-causing SNPs. We identified 1,535 CVD-associated SNPs that occur within human heart footprints/enhancers and 9,309 variants in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with differential gene expression profiles in cardiac tissue. Using hiPSC-CM ChIP-seq data from NKX2-5 and TBX5, two cardiac TFs essential for proper heart development, we trained a large-scale gapped k-mer SVM (LS-GKM-SVM) predictive model that can identify binding sites altered by CVD-associated SNPs. The computational predictive model was tested by scoring human heart footprints and enhancers in vitro through electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Three variants (rs59310144, rs6715570, and rs61872084) were prioritized for in vitro validation based on their eQTL in cardiac tissue and LS-GKM-SVM prediction to alter NKX2-5 DNA binding.

Sex-based differences in cancer biology are commonly studied using a murine model with BLCA generated by N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)-nitrosamine (BBN). While tumors in the BBN model have been profiled, these profiles provide limited information on the tumor microenvironment. Here, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing to characterize cell-type specific transcriptional differences between male and female BBN-induced tumors. We found proportional and gene expression differences in epithelial and non-epithelial subpopulations between male and female tumors. Expression of several genes predicted sex-specific survival in several human BLCA datasets. We identified novel and clinically relevant sex-specific transcriptional signatures including immune cells in the tumor microenvironment and it validated the relevance of the BBN model for studying sex differences in human BLCA. This work highlights the importance of considering sex as a biological variable in the development of new and accurate cancer markers.© 2023 The Authors."

Our study aimed to explore the effect of maternal and/or paternal obesity on the ovarian tissues of the first-generation female offspring in rats. The study was conducted on 40 adult Wistar albino rats (20 males and 20 females). Obesity was induced by feeding them an obesogenic diet for 3 months. The pregnancy was induced in the females by mating with males in four combinations: healthy mother with healthy father (control parents, CP), healthy mother with obese fathers (OF), obese mothers with healthy father (OM), and obese mother with obese father (obese parents, OP). After delivery, the female offspring at two months were sacrificed, and the blood and ovarian tissues were collected to assess the studied parameters. Our result showed differential impacts of maternal and paternal obesity on the ovarian health of the female offspring. The female offspring of obese OM or OP showed early signs of obesity. These metabolic abnormalities were associated with signs of ovarian lesions, impaired folliculogenesis, and decreased oocyte quality and also showed significant alterations in mitochondrial biogenesis, redox status, inflammation, and microRNAs expression (miR-149 and miR-494). In conclusion, altered ovarian expression of microRNAs and associated impaired mitochondrial biogenesis pathways may be the root causes for the observed intergeneration transmission of the obesogenic phenotype.© 2023.

Given the significant impact of metabolism on disease progression, exploring the interaction between the metabolome and epigenome may offer new insights into Huntington's disease (HD) diagnosis and treatment. Using fourteen post-mortem HD cases and fourteen control subjects, we performed metabolomic profiling of human postmortem brain tissue (striatum and frontal lobe), and we performed DNA methylome profiling using the same frontal lobe tissue. Along with finding several perturbed metabolites and differentially methylated loci, Aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis (adjp-value = 0.0098) was the most significantly perturbed metabolic pathway with which two CpGs of theSEPSECSgene were correlated. This study improves our understanding of molecular biomarker connections and, importantly, increases our knowledge of metabolic alterations driving HD progression."
"805",37884865,NA,NA,"Understanding changes in cell identity in cancer and ageing is of great importance. In this work, we analyzed how gene expression changes in human tissues are associated with tissue specificity during cancer and ageing using transcriptome data from TCGA and GTEx.We found significant downregulation of tissue-specific genes during ageing in 40% of the tissues analyzed, which suggests loss of tissue identity with age. For most cancer types, we have noted a consistent pattern of downregulation in genes that are specific to the tissue from which the tumor originated. Moreover, we observed in cancer an activation of genes not usually expressed in the tissue of origin as well as an upregulation of genes specific to other tissues. These patterns in cancer were associated with patient survival. The age of the patient, however, did not influence these patterns.We identified loss of cellular identity in 40% of the tissues analysed during human ageing, and a clear pattern in cancer, where during tumorigenesis cells express genes specific to other organs while suppressing the expression of genes from their original tissue. The loss of cellular identity observed in cancer is associated with prognosis and is not influenced by age, suggesting that it is a crucial stage in carcinogenesis.© 2023. The Author(s)."

After macrophage senescence, the biochemical phenotypes related to biological functions showed great heterogeneity. However, the biochemical phenotype and phenotypic heterogeneity of senescent macrophage has not been fully understood. Exploring the phenotype of biochemical substances in senescent macrophage will be helpful for understanding the function of senescent macrophage and finding out the potential mechanism between immune macrophage senescence and age-related diseases. In this study, we employed SR-FTIR microspectroscopy to detect the biochemical phenotype and phenotypic heterogeneity of single macrophage. The whole infrared spectra of senescent macrophages shifted, indicating biochemical substance changes within senescent macrophages. PCA and intercellular Euclidean distance statistical analysis based on specific spectra regions revealed dynamic changes of lipids and proteins during macrophage senescence. This proved that SR-FTIR microspectroscopy is an effective tool to detect the single cell biochemical phenotype transformation and phenotypic heterogeneity during macrophage senescence. It is of great significance to provide an evaluation method or clue for the study of cellular functions related to intracellular biochemical substances.© 2023. The Author(s)."

This panoramic review aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms involved in CAD pathogenesis and highlights the potential implications for personalized medicine approaches. Epigenetics is the study of heritable changes that do not influence alterations in the DNA sequence of the genome. It has been shown that epigenetic processes, including DNA/histone methylation, acetylation, and phosphorylation, play an important role. Additionally, miRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs are also involved in epigenetics, regulating gene expression patterns in response to various environmental factors and lifestyle choices. In the context of CAD, epigenetic alterations contribute to the dysregulation of genes involved in inflammation, oxidative stress, lipid metabolism, and vascular function. These epigenetic changes can occur during early developmental stages and persist throughout life, predisposing individuals to an increased risk of CAD. Furthermore, in recent years, the concept of personalized medicine has gained significant attention. Personalized medicine aims to tailor medical interventions based on an individual's unique genetic, epigenetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. In the context of CAD, understanding the interplay between genetic variants and epigenetic modifications holds promise for the development of more precise diagnostic tools, risk stratification models, and targeted therapies. This review summarizes the current knowledge of epigenetic mechanisms in CAD and discusses the fundamental principles of personalized medicine."

However, the age-related mechanism of IMF deposition has not yet been elucidated. In this study, the IMF, phospholipids (PL), triglycerides (TG), and fatty acid (FA) content in the breast muscle of Beijing-You chicken (BJY) at 1, 56, 98, and 120 d of age was measured, and mRNA and miRNA sequencing was integrated to explore the regulatory genes of IMF deposition. The results showed that the IMF content of BJY at 1 d of age was significantly higher than that at later stage of birth (P < 0.05). The transcriptome sequencing results showed that 7, 225 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 243 differentially expressed miRNAs (DE-miRNAs) were identified. The cluster analysis showed that the expression of DEGs and DE-miRNAs at 1 d of age was significantly different from that at later stages of birth. Furthermore, a potential mRNA-miRNA regulatory network related to IMF deposition was established by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA); gga-miR-29c-3p-PIK3R1, gga-miR-6701-3p-PTEN, gga-miR-363-3p-PTEN, gga-miR-1563-WWP1, gga-miR-449c/d-5p-TRAF6, and gga-miR-6701-3p-BMPR1B were identified as key mRNA-miRNA pairs for the regulation of IMF deposition. These results will help elucidate the mechanism of IMF formation mediated by miRNAs in chickens, and provide a theoretical foundation for the genetic improvement of broiler meat quality.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

We studied gene expression in 212,713 ventral midbrain single nuclei from 95 individuals with history of opioid misuse, and individuals without drug exposure. Chronic exposure to opioids was not associated with change in proportions of glial and neuronal subtypes, however glial transcriptomes were broadly altered, involving 9.5 - 6.2% of expressed genes within microglia, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes. Genes associated with activation of the immune response including interferon, NFkB signaling, and cell motility pathways were upregulated, contrasting with down-regulated expression of synaptic signaling and plasticity genes in ventral midbrain non-dopaminergic neurons. Ventral midbrain transcriptomic reprogramming in the context of chronic opioid exposure included 325 genes that previous genome-wide studies had linked to risk of substance use traits in the broader population, thereby pointing to heritable risk architectures in the genomic organization of the brain's reward circuitry.© 2023.

"810",37828503,"Parents, but not their children, demonstrate greater delay discounting with resource scarcity.","BMC Public Health","Individuals with obesity tend to discount the future (delay discounting), focusing on immediate gratification. Delay discounting is reliably related to indicators of economic scarcity (i.e., insufficient resources), including lower income and decreased educational attainment in adults. It is unclear whether the impact of these factors experienced by parents also influence child delay discounting between the ages of 8 and 12-years in families with obesity.The relationship between indices of family income and delay discounting was studied in 452 families with parents and 6-12-year-old children with obesity. Differences in the relationships between parent economic, educational and Medicaid status, and parent and child delay discounting were tested.Results showed lower parent income (p = 0.019) and Medicaid status (p = 0.021) were differentially related to greater parent but not child delay discounting among systematic responders.These data suggest differences in how indicators of scarcity influence delay discounting for parents and children, indicating that adults with scarce resources may be shaped to focus on immediate needs instead of long-term goals. It is possible that parents can reduce the impact of economic scarcity on their children during preadolescent years. These findings suggest a need for policy change to alleviate the burden of scarce conditions and intervention to modify delay discounting rate and to improve health-related choices and to address weight disparities.© 2023.

"811",37780853,"Nature and nurture: understanding phenotypic variation in inborn errors of immunity.","Front Cell Infect Microbiol","The overall disease burden of pediatric infection is high, with widely varying clinical outcomes including death. Among the most vulnerable children, those with inborn errors of immunity, reduced penetrance and variable expressivity are common but poorly understood. There are several genetic mechanisms that influence phenotypic variation in inborn errors of immunity, as well as a body of knowledge on environmental influences and specific pathogen triggers. Critically, recent advances are illuminating novel nuances for fundamental concepts on disease penetrance, as well as raising new areas of inquiry. The last few decades have seen the identification of almost 500 causes of inborn errors of immunity, as well as major advancements in our ability to characterize somatic events, the microbiome, and genotypes across large populations. The progress has not been linear, and yet, these developments have accumulated into an enhanced ability to diagnose and treat inborn errors of immunity, in some cases with precision therapy. Nonetheless, many questions remain regarding the genetic and environmental contributions to phenotypic variation both within and among families. The purpose of this review is to provide an updated summary of key concepts in genetic and environmental contributions to phenotypic variation within inborn errors of immunity, conceptualized as including dynamic, reciprocal interplay among factors unfolding across the key dimension of time. The associated findings, potential gaps, and implications for research are discussed in turn for each major influencing factor. The substantial challenge ahead will be to organize and integrate information in such a way that accommodates the heterogeneity within inborn errors of immunity to arrive at a more comprehensive and accurate understanding of how the immune system operates in health and disease. And, crucially, to translate this understanding into improved patient care for the millions at risk for serious infection and other immune-related morbidity.Copyright © 2023 Similuk and Kuijpers."
"812",37875556,"Construction of a novel prognostic model in skin cutaneous melanoma based on chemokines-related gene signature.","Sci Rep","Skin cutaneous melanoma, SKCM, is one of the most aggressive treatment-resistant tumours. Despite the fact that the BRAF oncogene and immunological checkpoints such as PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 have enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of SKCM, the subsequent resistance mechanisms and remedies have raised concerns. Chemokines have a significant role in the immunological milieu of tumor, which may increase the efficacy of checkpoint blockade and serve as a possible therapeutic intervention route. However, there is still no chemokine-based typing and risk model to provide a prognosis and therapeutic efficacy assessment for SKCM patients. In this study, we verified the distinct differences of prognostic stratification as well as immune characteristics between two chemokine-related clusters in SKCM patients. Two clusters of DEGs were discovered to be primarily enriched in B and T cell receptor signaling pathways as well as TNF signaling via NF-kappa-B. Based on 14 prognosis-related DEGs from aforementioned two clusters (CCL8, GBP2, GBP4, SRNG, HLA-DMB, RARRES3, HLA-DQA1, PARP12, APOL3, IRF1, HLA-DRA, UBE2L6, IL2RA and CD38), a chemokine-related 14-gene prognostic model was established. At the same time, researchers explored differences between the low-risk and high-risk groups in clinical traits, the proportion of infiltration of 22 different types of immune cells, and how well medications worked. The risk score model's immunotherapy and prognostic predictions were also confirmed in testing groups. Based on the finding, we can claim that there is a clear link between chemokines and TME in SKCM. The risk score may perform as a trustworthy prediction model, giving therapeutic benefits for both chemotherapy and immunotherapy, as well as being beneficial for clinical decision making in SKCM patients.© 2023.

Despite the growing knowledge about the pathogenesis of DKD, we still do not have effective direct pharmacotherapy. Accurate blood sugar control is essential in slowing down DKD. It seems that metformin has a positive impact on kidneys and this effect is not only mediated by its hypoglycemic action, but also by direct molecular regulation of pathways involved in DKD. The molecular mechanism of DKD is complex and we can distinguish polyol, hexosamine, PKC, and AGE pathways which play key roles in the development and progression of this disease. Each of these pathways is overactivated in a hyperglycemic environment and it seems that most of them may be regulated by metformin.

Osteoblast differentiation is reduced during osteoporosis development, resulting in reduced bone formation. Further, MSC isolated from different donors possess distinct osteogenic capacity. In this study, we used single-cell multiomic analysis to profile the transcriptome and epigenome of MSC from four healthy donors. Data were obtained from ~1300 to 1600 cells for each donor. These cells were clustered into four groups, indicating that MSC from different donors have distinct chromatin accessible regulatory elements for regulating gene expression. To investigate the mechanism by which MSC undergo osteogenic differentiation, we used the chromatin accessibility data from the single-cell multiome data to identify individual-specific enhancer-promoter pairs and evaluated the expression levels and activities of the transcriptional regulators. The MSC from four donors showed distinct differentiation potential into osteoblasts. MSC of donor 1 showed the largest average motif activities, indicating that MSC from donor 1 was most likely to differentiate into osteoblasts. The results of our validation experiments were consistent with the bioinformatics prediction. We also tested the enrichment of genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals of several musculoskeletal disease traits in the patient-specific chromatin accessible regions identified in the single-cell multiome data, including osteoporosis, osteopenia, and osteoarthritis. We found that osteoarthritis-associated variants were only enriched in the regions identified from donor 4. In contrast, osteoporosis and osteopenia variants were enriched in regions from donor 1 and least enriched in donor 4. Since osteoporosis and osteopenia are related to the density of bone cells, the enrichment of variants from these traits should be correlated with the osteogenic potential of MSC. In summary, this study provides large-scale data to link regulatory elements with their target genes to study the regulatory relationships during the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells and provide a deeper insight into the gene regulatory mechanism."

These two data types provide complementary information for deciphering cell types and states. However, when analyzed individually, they sometimes produce conflicting results regarding cell type/state assignment. The power is compromised since the two modalities reflect the same underlying biology. Recently, it has become possible to measure both gene expression and chromatin accessibility from the same nucleus. Such paired data enable the direct modeling of the relationships between the two modalities. Given the availability of the vast amount of single-modality data, it is desirable to integrate the paired and unpaired single-modality datasets to gain a comprehensive view of the cellular complexity.We benchmark nine existing single-cell multi-omic data integration methods. Specifically, we evaluate to what extent the multiome data provide additional guidance for analyzing the existing single-modality data, and whether these methods uncover peak-gene associations from single-modality data. Our results indicate that multiome data are helpful for annotating single-modality data. However, we emphasize that the availability of an adequate number of nuclei in the multiome dataset is crucial for achieving accurate cell type annotation. Insufficient representation of nuclei may compromise the reliability of the annotations. Additionally, when generating a multiome dataset, the number of cells is more important than sequencing depth for cell type annotation.Seurat v4 is the best currently available platform for integrating scRNA-seq, snATAC-seq, and multiome data even in the presence of complex batch effects.© 2023.

However, the genetic mechanisms and target genes underlying these loci are largely unknown, as most risk-associated-variants might regulate gene expression in a context-specific manner. Here, we generated a barcode-shared transcriptome and chromatin accessibility map of 117,911 human lung cells from age/sex-matched ever- and never-smokers to profile context-specific gene regulation. Accessible chromatin peak detection identified cell-type-specific candidatecis-regulatory elements (cCREs) from each lung cell type. Colocalization of lung cancer candidate causal variants (CCVs) with these cCREs prioritized the variants for 68% of the GWAS loci, a subset of which was also supported by transcription factor abundance and footprinting. cCRE colocalization and single-cell based trait relevance score nominated epithelial and immune cells as the main cell groups contributing to lung cancer susceptibility. Notably, cCREs of rare proliferating epithelial cell types, such as AT2-proliferating (0.13%) and basal cells (1.8%), overlapped with CCVs, including those inTERT. A multi-level cCRE-gene linking system identified candidate susceptibility genes from 57% of lung cancer loci, including those not detected in tissue- or cell-line-based approaches. cCRE-gene linkage uncovered that adjacent genes expressed in different cell types are correlated with distinct subsets of coinherited CCVs, includingJAMLandMPZL3at the 11q23.3 locus.

We performed cis-RNA editing quantitative trait loci analysis and a two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) study by integrating genome-wide association studies to infer the potential causality between A-to-I editing and PD pathogenesis. The potential causal A-to-I editing sites were further confirmed by Summary-data-based MR analysis. Spearman's correlation analysis was performed to characterize the association between longitudinal A-to-I editing and cognitive progression in patients with PD.We identified 17 potential causal A-to-I editing sites for PD and indicated that genetic risk variants may contribute to the risk of PD through A-to-I editing. These A-to-I editing sites were located in genes NCOR1, KANSL1 and BST1. Moreover, we observed 57 sites whose longitudinal A-to-I editing levels correlated with cognitive progression in PD.We found potential causal A-to-I editing sites for PD onset and longitudinal changes of A-to-I editing were associated with cognitive progression in PD.

However, the presence of linkage disequilibrium (LD) makes it challenging to identify the causal variants. To address this critical gap from association to causation, many fine mapping methods have been proposed to assign well-calibrated probabilities of causality to candidate variants, taking into account the underlying LD pattern. In this manuscript, we introduce a statistical framework that incorporates expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) information to fine mapping, built on the sum of single-effects (SuSiE) regression model. Our new method, SuSiE2, connects two SuSiE models, one for eQTL analysis and one for genetic fine mapping. This is achieved by first computing the posterior inclusion probabilities (PIPs) from an eQTL-based SuSiE model with the expression level of the candidate gene as the phenotype. These calculated PIPs are then utilized as prior inclusion probabilities for risk variants in another SuSiE model for the trait of interest. By leveraging eQTL information, SuSiE2enhances the power of detecting causal SNPs while reducing false positives and the average size of credible sets by prioritizing functional variants within the candidate region. The advantages of SuSiE2over SuSiE are demonstrated by simulations and an application to a single-cell epigenomic study for Alzheimer's disease. We also demonstrate that eQTL information can be used by SuSiE2to compensate for the power loss because of an inaccurate LD matrix."

Methylation of the locus can lead to a modulation of gene expression. Allele-specific DNA methylation (ASM) refers to the targeted methylation delivery only to one allele of a locus. In the context of diseases caused by a dominant mutation, the selective DNA methylation of the mutant allele could be used to repress its expression but retain the functionality of the normal gene.To set up allele-specific targeted DNA methylation, target regions were selected from hypomethylated CGIs bearing a heterozygous SNP in their promoters in the HEK293 cell line. We aimed at delivering maximum DNA methylation with highest allelic specificity in the targeted regions. Placing SNPs in the PAM or seed regions of the sgRNA, we designed 24 different sgRNAs targeting single alleles in 14 different gene loci. We achieved efficient ASM in multiple cases, such as ISG15, MSH6, GPD1L, MRPL52, PDE8A, NARF, DAP3, and GSPT1, which in best cases led to five to tenfold stronger average DNA methylation at the on-target allele and absolute differences in the DNA methylation gain at on- and off-target alleles of > 50%. In general, loci with the allele discriminatory SNP positioned in the PAM region showed higher success rate of ASM and better specificity. Highest DNA methylation was observed on day 3 after transfection followed by a gradual decline. In selected cases, ASM was stable up to 11 days in HEK293 cells and it led up to a 3.6-fold change in allelic expression ratios.We successfully delivered ASM at multiple genomic loci with high specificity, efficiency and stability. This form of super-specific epigenome editing could find applications in the treatment of diseases caused by dominant mutations, because it allows silencing of the mutant allele without repression of the expression of the normal allele thereby minimizing potential side-effects of the treatment.© 2023.

Tau also localizes in the cell nucleus and evidence supports an emerging function of Tau in DNA stability and epigenetic modulation.Methods:To better characterize the possible role of Tau in regulation of chromatin compaction and subsequent gene expression, we performed a bioinformatics analysis of transcriptome data obtained from Tau-depleted human neuroblastoma cells.Results:Among the transcripts deregulated in a Tau-dependent manner, we found an enrichment of target genes for the polycomb repressive complex 2. We further describe decreased cellular amounts of the core components of the polycomb repressive complex 2 and lower histone 3 trimethylation in Tau deficient cells. Among the de-repressed polycomb repressive complex 2 target gene products, IGFBP3 protein was found to be linked to increased senescence induction in Tau-deficient cells.Discussion:Our findings propose a mechanism for Tau-dependent epigenetic modulation of cell senescence, a key event in pathologic aging.Copyright © 2023 Magrin, Bellafante, Sola, Piovesana, Bolis, Cascione, Napoli, Rinaldi, Papin and Paganetti."

Microglia (MG) play a crucial role in uptake of Aβ fibrils, and its dysfunction worsens AD. However, the effect of HHcy on MG Aβ phagocytosis remains unstudied.We isolated MG from the cerebrum of HHcy mice with genetic cystathionine-β-synthase deficiency (Cbs-/-) and performed bulk RNA-seq. We performed meta-analysis over transcriptomes of Cbs-/-mouse MG, human and mouse AD MG, MG Aβ phagocytosis model, human AD methylome, and GWAS AD genes.HHcy and hypomethylation conditions were identified in Cbs-/-mice. Through Cbs-/-MG transcriptome analysis, 353 MG DEGs were identified. Phagosome formation and integrin signaling pathways were found suppressed in Cbs-/-MG. By analyzing MG transcriptomes from 4 AD patient and 7 mouse AD datasets, 409 human and 777 mouse AD MG DEGs were identified, of which 37 were found common in both species. Through further combinatory analysis with transcriptome from MG Aβ phagocytosis model, we identified 130 functional-validated Aβ phagocytic AD MG DEGs (20 in human AD, 110 in mouse AD), which reflected a compensatory activation of Aβ phagocytosis. Interestingly, we identified 14 human Aβ phagocytic AD MG DEGs which represented impaired MG Aβ phagocytosis in human AD. Finally, through a cascade of meta-analysis of transcriptome of AD MG, functional phagocytosis, HHcy MG, and human AD brain methylome dataset, we identified 5 HHcy-suppressed phagocytic AD MG DEGs (Flt1, Calponin 3, Igf1, Cacna2d4, and Celsr) which were reported to regulate MG/MΦ migration and Aβ phagocytosis.We established molecular signatures for a compensatory response of Aβ phagocytosis activation in human and mouse AD MG and impaired Aβ phagocytosis in human AD MG. Our discoveries suggested that hypomethylation may modulate HHcy-suppressed MG Aβ phagocytosis in AD.© 2023. BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature."

In this current study, our aim was to evaluate thousands of scientific documents and asthma associated omics datasets to identify the most crucial therapeutic target for experimental validation. We leveraged the proprietary tool Ontosight®Discover to annotate asthma associated genes and proteins. Additionally, we also collected and evaluated asthma related patient datasets through bioinformatics and machine learning based approaches to identify most suitable targets. Identified targets were further evaluated based on the various biological parameters to scrutinize their candidature for the ideal therapeutic target. We identified 7237 molecular targets from published scientific documents, 2932 targets from genomic structured databases and 7690 dysregulated genes from the transcriptomics and 560 targets from genomics mutational analysis. In total, 18,419 targets from all the desperate sources were analyzed and evaluated though our approach to identify most promising targets in asthma. Our study revealed IL-13 as one of the most important targets for asthma with approved drugs on the market currently. TNF, VEGFA and IL-18 were the other top targets identified to be explored for therapeutic benefit in asthma but need further clinical testing.

However, our understanding of how these processes (for example, DNA replication, RNA transcription, chromatin extrusion and nucleosome remodeling) occur on individual chromatin arrays remains unresolved. Here, to address this deficit, we present SAMOSA-ChAAT: a massively multiplex single-molecule footprinting approach to map the primary structure of individual, reconstituted chromatin templates subject to virtually any chromatin-associated reaction. We apply this method to distinguish between competing models for chromatin remodeling by the essential imitation switch (ISWI) ATPase SNF2h: nucleosome-density-dependent spacing versus fixed-linker-length nucleosome clamping. First, we perform in vivo single-molecule nucleosome footprinting in murine embryonic stem cells, to discover that ISWI-catalyzed nucleosome spacing correlates with the underlying nucleosome density of specific epigenomic domains. To establish causality, we apply SAMOSA-ChAAT to quantify the activities of ISWI ATPase SNF2h and its parent complex ACF on reconstituted nucleosomal arrays of varying nucleosome density, at single-molecule resolution. We demonstrate that ISWI remodelers operate as density-dependent, length-sensing nucleosome sliders, whose ability to program DNA accessibility is dictated by single-molecule nucleosome density. We propose that the long-observed, context-specific regulatory effects of ISWI complexes can be explained in part by the sensing of nucleosome density within epigenomic domains. More generally, our approach promises molecule-precise views of the essential processes that shape nuclear physiology.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"829",37846362,NA,NA,"Retinal diseases characterized with irreversible loss of retinal nerve cells, such as optic atrophy and retinal degeneration, are the main causes of blindness. Current treatments for these diseases are very limited. An emerging treatment strategy is to induce the reprogramming of Müller glial cells to generate new retinal nerve cells, which could potentially restore vision.Müller glial cells are the predominant glial cells in retinae and play multiple roles to maintain retinal homeostasis. In lower vertebrates, such as in zebrafish, Müller glial cells can undergo cell reprogramming to regenerate new retinal neurons in response to various damage factors, while in mammals, this ability is limited. Interestingly, with proper treatments, Müller glial cells can display the potential for regeneration of retinal neurons in mammalian retinae. Recent studies have revealed that dozens of genetic and epigenetic regulators play a vital role in inducing the reprogramming of Müller glial cells in vivo. This review summarizes these critical regulators for Müller glial cell reprogramming and highlights their differences between zebrafish and mammals.A number of factors have been identified as the important regulators in Müller glial cell reprogramming. The early response of Müller glial cells upon acute retinal injury, such as the regulation in the exit from quiescent state, the initiation of reactive gliosis, and the re-entry of cell cycle of Müller glial cells, displays significant difference between mouse and zebrafish, which may be mediated by the diverse regulation of Notch and TGFβ (transforming growth factor-β) isoforms and different chromatin accessibility.© 2023 The Authors."
"830",37744557,"Reprogramming endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells to prevent and treat hypertension.","Med Hypotheses","The major pathophysiological characteristic of hypertension is the occurrence of small artery remodeling and endothelial dysfunction. There is also solid evidence showing that microcirculation abnormalities occur prior to the onset of hypertension. However, the mechanism(s) that trigger these changes prior to the elevation of blood pressure are unknown, and this may limit our ability to identify the cause of this disease and effectively treat it. In hypertension, as with aging, the vasculature becomes less susceptible to repair. One of the reasons is because endothelial cells start to deteriorate and present with exacerbated endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT). Likewise, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) also dedifferentiate into a synthetic phenotype, whereby they start to produce and secrete extracellular vesicles with a high migration and proliferation capacity for repairing vascular injury. Uncontrolled EndMT and/or VSMC phenotype switching contributes to vascular diseases, but the initial trigger for these conditions is unidentified. Importantly, EndMT and synthetic VSMC exhibit plasticity and can return to adopt an endothelial cell-like fate and present contractile phenotype again, respectively. Therefore, in this hypothesis we will take advantage of this plasticity, and we propose to manipulate this fate by inducing partial cellular reprogramming without passing through the pluripotent state. Specifically, we suggest that activation of the three master transcription factors, Oct-4, Sox-2, and Klf-4 (collectively termed OSK) will reprogram endothelial cells and prevent and reduce EndMT and VSMC synthetic phenotype. It was recently shown that activation of OSK was able to restore lost vision in old mice, and cancer risk was reduced by excluding c-Myc. Therefore, OSK treatment could provide new possibilities for vascular rejuvenation and treatment of hypertension."

RGC repopulation is a promising therapeutic approach to reverse vision loss from optic neuropathies if the newly introduced neurons can reestablish functional retinal and thalamic circuits. In theory, RGCs might be repopulated through the transplantation of stem cell-derived neurons or via the induction of endogenous transdifferentiation. The RGC Repopulation, Stem Cell Transplantation, and Optic Nerve Regeneration (RReSTORe) Consortium was established to address the challenges associated with the therapeutic repair of the visual pathway in optic neuropathy. In 2022, the RReSTORe Consortium initiated ongoing international collaborative discussions to advance the RGC repopulation field and has identified five critical areas of focus: (1) RGC development and differentiation, (2) Transplantation methods and models, (3) RGC survival, maturation, and host interactions, (4) Inner retinal wiring, and (5) Eye-to-brain connectivity. Here, we discuss the most pertinent questions and challenges that exist on the path to clinical translation and suggest experimental directions to propel this work going forward. Using these five subtopic discussion groups (SDGs) as a framework, we suggest multidisciplinary approaches to restore the diseased visual pathway by leveraging groundbreaking insights from developmental neuroscience, stem cell biology, molecular biology, optical imaging, animal models of optic neuropathy, immunology & immunotolerance, neuropathology & neuroprotection, materials science & biomedical engineering, and regenerative neuroscience. While significant hurdles remain, the RReSTORe Consortium's efforts provide a comprehensive roadmap for advancing the RGC repopulation field and hold potential for transformative progress in restoring vision in patients suffering from optic neuropathies.© 2023.

"832",37732074,"Perturbation of 3D nuclear architecture, epigenomic dysregulation and aging, and cannabinoid synaptopathy reconfigures conceptualization of cannabinoid pathophysiology: part 1-aging and epigenomics.","Front Psychiatry","Much recent attention has been directed toward the spatial organization of the cell nucleus and the manner in which three-dimensional topologically associated domains and transcription factories are epigenetically coordinated to precisely bring enhancers into close proximity with promoters to control gene expression. Twenty lines of evidence robustly implicate cannabinoid exposure with accelerated organismal and cellular aging. Aging has recently been shown to be caused by increased DNA breaks. These breaks rearrange and maldistribute the epigenomic machinery to weaken and reverse cellular differentiation, cause genome-wide DNA demethylation, reduce gene transcription, and lead to the inhibition of developmental pathways, which contribute to the progressive loss of function and chronic immune stimulation that characterize cellular aging. Both cell lineage-defining superenhancers and the superanchors that control them are weakened. Cannabis exposure phenocopies the elements of this process and reproduces DNA and chromatin breakages, reduces the DNA, RNA protein and histone synthesis, interferes with the epigenomic machinery controlling both DNA and histone modifications, induces general DNA hypomethylation, and epigenomically disrupts both the critical boundary elements and the cohesin motors that create chromatin loops. This pattern of widespread interference with developmental programs and relative cellular dedifferentiation (which is pro-oncogenic) is reinforced by cannabinoid impairment of intermediate metabolism (which locks in the stem cell-like hyper-replicative state) and cannabinoid immune stimulation (which perpetuates and increases aging and senescence programs, DNA damage, DNA hypomethylation, genomic instability, and oncogenesis), which together account for the diverse pattern of teratologic and carcinogenic outcomes reported in recent large epidemiologic studies in Europe, the USA, and elsewhere. It also accounts for the prominent aging phenotype observed clinically in long-term cannabis use disorder and the 20 characteristics of aging that it manifests. Increasing daily cannabis use, increasing use in pregnancy, and exponential dose-response effects heighten the epidemiologic and clinical urgency of these findings. Together, these findings indicate that cannabinoid genotoxicity and epigenotoxicity are prominent features of cannabis dependence and strongly indicate coordinated multiomics investigations of cannabinoid genome-epigenome-transcriptome-metabolome, chromatin conformation, and 3D nuclear architecture. Considering the well-established exponential dose-response relationships, the diversity of cannabinoids, and the multigenerational nature of the implications, great caution is warranted in community cannabinoid penetration.Copyright © 2023 Reece and Hulse."
"833",37698783,"Geroprotective interventions converge on gene expression programs of reduced inflammation and restored fatty acid metabolism.","Geroscience","Understanding the mechanisms of geroprotective interventions is central to aging research. We compare four prominent interventions: senolysis, caloric restriction, in vivo partial reprogramming, and heterochronic parabiosis. Using published mice transcriptomic data, we juxtapose these interventions against normal aging. We find a gene expression program common to all four interventions, in which inflammation is reduced and several metabolic processes, especially fatty acid metabolism, are increased. Normal aging exhibits the inverse of this signature across multiple organs and tissues. A similar inverse signature arises in three chronic inflammation disease models in a non-aging context, suggesting that the shift in metabolism occurs downstream of inflammation. Chronic inflammation is also shown to accelerate transcriptomic age. We conclude that a core mechanism of geroprotective interventions acts through the reduction of inflammation with downstream effects that restore fatty acid metabolism. This supports the notion of directly targeting genes associated with these pathways to mitigate age-related deterioration.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Targeted removal of senescent cells in preclinical models promotes health and longevity, suggesting that the selective elimination of senescent cells is a promising therapeutic approach for mitigating a myriad of age-related pathologies in humans. However, moving senescence-targeting drugs (senotherapeutics) into the clinic will require therapeutic targets and biomarkers, fueled by an improved understanding of the complex and dynamic biology of senescent cell populations and their molecular profiles, as well as the mechanisms underlying the emergence and maintenance of senescence cells and the SASP. Advances in mass spectrometry-based proteomic technologies and workflows have the potential to address these needs. Here, we review the state of translational senescence research and how proteomic approaches have added to our knowledge of senescence biology to date. Further, we lay out a roadmap from fundamental biological discovery to the clinical translation of senotherapeutic approaches through the development and application of emerging proteomic technologies, including targeted and untargeted proteomic approaches, bottom-up and top-down methods, stability proteomics, and surfaceomics. These technologies are integral for probing the cellular composition and dynamics of senescent cells and, ultimately, the development of senotype-specific biomarkers and senotherapeutics (senolytics and senomorphics).

In agreement, genetic ablation studies reveal that elimination of senescent cells from aged tissues can ameliorate various age-related pathologies, including metabolic dysfunction and decreased physical fitness3-7. While small-molecule drugs capable of eliminating senescent cells (known as 'senolytics') partially replicate these phenotypes, many have undefined mechanisms of action and all require continuous administration to be effective. As an alternative approach, we have developed a cell-based senolytic therapy based on chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting uPAR, a cell-surface protein upregulated on senescent cells, and previously showed these can safely and efficiently eliminate senescent cells in young animals and reverse liver fibrosis8. We now show that uPAR-positive senescent cells accumulate during physiological aging and that they can be safely targeted with senolytic CAR T cells. Treatment with anti uPAR CAR T cells ameliorates metabolic dysfunction by improving glucose tolerance and exercise capacity in physiological aging as well as in a model of metabolic syndrome. Importantly, a single administration of a low dose of these senolytic CAR T cells is sufficient to achieve long-term therapeutic and preventive effects."

Since cirrhosis and sarcopenia are assumed to be closely interrelated in terms of pathogenesis, this review innovatively discussed the role of epigenetic modifications and microecological dysregulation in sarcopenia in the context of liver cirrhosis. Here we illustrated the relationship between sarcopenia and cirrhosis in the aspect of epigenetics, dysbiosis, and the crosstalk between gene modifications and intestinal microecology. Furthermore, the alterations in cirrhosis patients with sarcopenia, such as inflammatory response and oxidative stress, are found to present synergistic effects in the pathways of epigenetics and dysbiosis leading to sarcopenia. This review proposes that microbiome-based therapies are promising to break the vicious cycle between epigenetic modification and dysbiosis, providing strong support for the use of intestinal microecological interventions to prevent sarcopenia in cirrhotic patients.Copyright © 2023 Xu, Pan, Zhang, Dai and Xu."

Here, we examined DNA methylation status and allelic expression at the KBTBD6 locus across species and tissues and explored potential mechanisms of imprinting.Using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and RNA-sequencing on parthenogenetic and normal porcine embryos, we identified a maternally hypermethylated DMR between the embryos at the KBTBD6 promoter CpG island and paternal monoallelic expression of KBTBD6. Also, in analyzed domesticated mammals but not in humans, non-human primates and mice, the KBTBD6 promoter CpG islands were methylated in oocytes and/or allelically methylated in tissues, and monoallelic KBTBD6 expression was observed, indicating livestock-specific imprinting. Further analysis revealed that these CpG islands were embedded within transcripts in porcine and bovine oocytes which coexisted with an active transcription mark and DNA methylation, implying the presence of transcription-dependent imprinting.In this study, our comparative approach revealed an imprinted expression of the KBTBD6 gene in domesticated mammals, but not in humans, non-human primates, and mice which implicates species-specific evolution of genomic imprinting.© 2023.

The primary objective of this narrative review is to illuminate the association between genetic factors and BPD treatment outcomes, discussing the potential of genetic testing for personalized therapy. The review is derived from observational and experimental studies on BPD, genetic factors, and psychotherapy from 2000 to 2023, sourced primarily through PubMed. Reviews and meta-analyses were excluded. Our review suggests that genetic factors account for 40-60% of BPD variation, with significant roles played by epigenetic alterations like DNA methylation and microRNAs, particularly in the context of childhood trauma. Gene-environment interactions are also vital for BPD's development. Treatments such as dialectical behavior therapy, mentalization-based therapy, and schema therapy have shown efficacy, with success variability possibly linked to genetic factors. However, existing research is constrained by recall bias, diverse methodologies, and limited sample sizes. Future research necessitates long-term follow-up, diverse populations, and controlled variables to enhance our comprehension of BPD treatment outcomes' genetic foundations.

However, it is an invasive and often challenging procedure that cannot be used for frequent patient screening, detection of mutations, disease monitoring, or resistance to therapy. To this end, the minimally invasive procedure of liquid biopsy has emerged, allowing effortless tumor sampling and enabling continuous monitoring. It is considered a novel preferable way to obtain faster data on potential tumor risk, personalized diagnosis, prognosis, and recurrence evaluation. The purpose of this review is to describe the advances on liquid biopsy for glioma diagnosis and management, indicating several biomarkers that can be utilized to analyze tumor characteristics, such as cell-free DNA (cfDNA), cell-free RNA (cfRNA), circulating proteins, circulating tumor cells (CTCs), and exosomes.

The relationship between PINK1 and PARK2 protein expression and clinicopathological features were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to estimate the prognostic value of the PINK1 and PARK2 proteins in patients. Cox univariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess the risk factors affecting the OS for patients with ESCC.PINK1 and PARK2 had low expression in ESCC. Patients with low PINK1 had worse differentiation and advanced T and TNM stages. Lower PARK2 expression was linked to lymph node metastases and an advanced TNM stage. Furthermore, reduced PINK1 and PARK2 levels were associated with a poor prognosis for ESCC. Cox univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that PINK1, PARK2, and tumor size were closely associated with the prognosis of patients with ESCC, and PARK2 was an independent risk factor for patients with ESCC.

Recently, epigenetic modifications, particularly DNA methylation, have been recognized to play an important role in the onset of PD. Glycoprotein non-metastatic melanoma protein B (GPNMB), a type I transmembrane protein crucial for immune cell activation and maturation, has emerged as a potential biomarker for the risk of PD. This research aims to investigate the influence of exercise and gender on the regulation of methylation levels of GPNMB cg17274742 in individuals.We analyze data from 2,474 participants in the Taiwan Biobank, collected from 2008 and 2016. Methylation levels at theGPNMBcg17274742 CpG site were measured using Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC beads. After excluding individuals with incomplete data or missing information on possible risk factors, our final analysis included 1,442 participants. We used multiple linear regression models to assess the association between sex and exercise with adjusted levels ofGPNMBcg17274742 for age, BMI, smoking, drinking, coffee consumption, serum uric acid levels, and hypertension.Our results demonstrated that exercise significantly influenced the methylation levels ofGPNMBcg17274742 in males (β = -0.00242;p= 0.0026), but not in females (β = -0.00002362;p= 0.9785). Furthermore, male participants who exercised showed significantly lower levels of methylation compared to the reference groups of the female and non-exercising reference groups (β = -0.00357;p= 0.0079). The effect of the interaction between gender and exercise on the methylation ofGPNMBcg17274742 was statistically significant (p= 0.0078).This study suggests that gender and exercise can modulateGPNMBcg17274742, with hypomethylation observed in exercise men.

Despite the accumulation of ChIP-seq data and ChIP-seq-derived motifs, the diversity of DNA-binding specificities across different TFs and cell types remains largely unexplored.Here, we applied MOCCS2, our k-mer-based motif discovery method, to a collection of human TF ChIP-seq samples across diverse TFs and cell types, and systematically computed profiles of TF-binding specificity scores for all k-mers. After quality control, we compiled a set of TF-binding specificity score profiles for 2,976 high-quality ChIP-seq samples, comprising 473 TFs and 398 cell types. Using these high-quality samples, we confirmed that the k-mer-based TF-binding specificity profiles reflected TF- or TF-family dependent DNA-binding specificities. We then compared the binding specificity scores of ChIP-seq samples with the same TFs but with different cell type classes and found that half of the analyzed TFs exhibited differences in DNA-binding specificities across cell type classes. Additionally, we devised a method to detect differentially bound k-mers between two ChIP-seq samples and detected k-mers exhibiting statistically significant differences in binding specificity scores. Moreover, we demonstrated that differences in the binding specificity scores between k-mers on the reference and alternative alleles could be used to predict the effect of variants on TF binding, as validated by in vitro and in vivo assay datasets. Finally, we demonstrated that binding specificity score differences can be used to interpret disease-associated non-coding single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as TF-affecting SNPs and provide candidates responsible for TFs and cell types.Our study provides a basis for investigating the regulation of gene expression in a TF-, TF family-, or cell-type-dependent manner.

Genetic screening tools such as CRISPR screening, DNA sequencing and RNA interference have greatly improved our understanding of JEV replication and its potential antiviral approaches. However, information on exon and intron mutations associated with JEV replication is still scanty. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated cytosine base editing can efficiently generate C: G-to-T: A conversion in the genome of living cells. One intriguing application of base editing is to screen pivotal variants for gene function that is yet to be achieved in pigs. Here, we illustrate that CRISPR-Cas9-mediated cytosine base editor, known as AncBE4max, can be used for the functional analysis of calreticulin (CALR) variants. We conducted a CRISPR-Cas9-mediated cytosine base editing screen using 457 single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) against all exons and introns ofCALRto identify loss-of-function variants involved in JEV replication. We unexpectedly uncovered that two enriched sgRNAs targeted the same site in intron-2 of theCALRgene. We found that mutating four consecutive G bases in the intron-2 of theCALRgene to four A bases significantly inhibited JEV replication. Thus, we established a CRISPR-Cas9-mediated cytosine-base-editing point mutation screening technique in pigs. Our results suggest that CRISPR-mediated base editing is a powerful tool for identifying the antiviral functions of variants in the coding and noncoding regions of theCALRgene."

In this study, we explore the cellular landscape of the hippocampus in a DS mouse model through single-nuclei transcriptional profiling. Our findings demonstrate that trisomy manifests as a highly specific modification of the transcriptome within distinct cell types. Remarkably, we observed a significant shift in the transcriptomic profile of granule cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) associated with trisomy. We identified the downregulation of a specific small nucleolar RNA host gene,Snhg11, as the primary driver behind this observed shift in the trisomic DG. Notably, reduced levels ofSnhg11in this region were also observed in a distinct DS mouse model, the Dp(16)1Yey, as well as in human postmortem tissue, indicating its relevance in Down syndrome. To elucidate the function of this long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), we knocked downSnhg11in the DG of wild-type mice. Intriguingly, this intervention alone was sufficient to impair synaptic plasticity and adult neurogenesis, resembling the cognitive phenotypes associated with trisomy in the hippocampus. Our study uncovers the functional role ofSnhg11in the DG and underscores the significance of this lncRNA in intellectual disability. Furthermore, our findings highlight the importance of the DG in the memory deficits observed in Down syndrome."

Nonetheless, it is still largely unclear how Cu consumption in the diet relates to the risk for all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality.Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2001-2018 were used to conduct a prospective cohort study of individuals between the ages of 20 years and above. Regression coefficients and 95% confidence intervals for the link between dietary Cu consumption and all-cause and cardiovascular-related mortality were computed utilizing univariate and multivariate-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models.A total of 197.9 million non-institutionalized American citizens were represented by the NHANES's 39,784 participants. The link between Cu in the diet and all-cause mortality was discovered to be non-linear in our restricted cubic spline regression models. When comparing the highest with the lowest quartile of Cu consumption in the diet, the weighted multivariate hazard ratios for all-cause mortality were 0.91 (0.83-0.99) for Q2, 0.88 (0.80-0.97) for Q3, and 0.86 (0.76-0.98) for Q4 (P for trend = 0.017). An identical trend was observed for cardiovascular mortality, but the association is not significant.The most important discovery was that higher dietary Cu consumption was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality. This trend was also consistent with that of cardiovascular-related mortality, but the association is not significant.Copyright: This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

A number of heritability and behavioral genetics studies, including pedigree-based investigations, have hypothesized inheritance patterns of human sexual behaviors. On the other hand, in most twin, adoption, and nuclear family studies, it was not possible to disentangle between underlying genetic and shared environmental sources. Furthermore, these studies were not able to estimate the precise extent of genetic loading and to shed light both on the number and nature of the putative inherited factors, which remained largely unknown. Molecular genetic studies offer an unprecedented opportunity to overcome these drawbacks, by dissecting the molecular basis of human sexuality and allowing a better understanding of its biological roots if any. However, there exists no systematic review of the molecular genetics of human sexuality. Therefore, we undertook this critical systematic review and appraisal of the literature, with the ambitious aims of filling in these gaps of knowledge, especially from the methodological standpoint, and providing guidance to future studies. Sixteen studies were finally retained and overviewed in the present systematic review study. Seven studies were linkage studies, four studies utilized the candidate gene approach, and five studies were GWAS investigations. Limitations of these studies and implications for further research are discussed.Copyright © 2023 Bragazzi, Converti, Crapanzano, Zerbetto, Siri and Khamisy-Farah."

Drawing on a bioinformatically-informed network approach, we situate these findings in a broader molecular framework by examining the upstream regulators of SES-associated transcriptional alterations. Data come from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), a nationally representative sample of 4,543 adults in the United States. Results reveal a network-of differentially-expressed genes, transcription factors, and protein neighbors of transcription factors- that shows widespread SES-related dysregulation of the immune system. Mediational models suggest that body mass index plays a key role in accounting for many of these associations. Overall, the results reveal the central role of upstream regulators in socioeconomic differences in the molecular basis of immunity, which propagate to increase risk of chronic health conditions in later-life."

In this paper, we present a reliable, PCR-based method to determine accurately the relative 6mA levels in the mtDNA ofCaenorhabditis elegans,Drosophila melanogasterand dogs, and show that these levels gradually increase with age. Furthermore,daf-2(-)-mutant worms, which are defective for insulin/IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor) signaling and live twice as long as the wild type, display a half rate at which 6mA progressively accumulates in the mtDNA as compared to normal values.

Establishing recognizable stages over the whole fruit lifetime represents a fundamental requirement for research and fruit crop cultivation. This is especially relevant in perennial crops like grapevine (Vitis viniferaL.) to scale the development of its fruit across genotypes and growing conditions. In this work, molecular-based information from several grape berry transcriptomic datasets was exploited to build a molecular phenology scale (MPhS) and to map the ontogenic development of the fruit. The proposed statistical pipeline consisted of an unsupervised learning procedure yielding an innovative combination of semiparametric, smoothing, and dimensionality reduction tools. The transcriptomic distance between fruit samples was precisely quantified by means of the MPhS that also enabled to highlight the complex dynamics of the transcriptional program over berry development through the calculation of the rate of variation of MPhS stages by time. The MPhS allowed the alignment of time-series fruit samples proving to be a complementary method for mapping the progression of grape berry development with higher detail compared to classic time- or phenotype-based approaches.© The Author(s) 2023.

Here, we characterized the ac4C modification landscape in mouse early embryos and found that the majority of embryos deficient in ac4C writer-NAT10 failed to develop into normal blastocysts. Through single-cell sequencing, RNA-seq, acetylated RNA immunoprecipitation combined with PCR (acRIP-PCR), and embryonic phenotype monitoring, Nop2 was screened as a target gene of Nat10. Mechanistically, Nat10 knockdown decreases the ac4C modification on Nop2 mRNA and reduces RNA and protein abundance by affecting the mRNA stability of Nop2. Then, depletion of NOP2 may inhibit the translation of transcription factor TEAD4, resulting in defective expression of the downstream lineage-specific gene Cdx2, and ultimately preventing blastomeres from undergoing the trophectoderm (TE) fate. However, exogenous Nop2 mRNA partially reverses this abnormal development. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that defective ac4C modification of Nop2 mRNA hinders the morula-to-blastocyst transition by influencing the first cell fate decision in mice.© 2023.

"856",37831410,"Duplications of Human Longevity-Associated Genes Across Placental Mammals.","Genome Biol Evol","Natural selection has shaped a wide range of lifespans across mammals, with a few long-lived species showing negligible signs of ageing. Approaches used to elucidate the genetic mechanisms underlying mammalian longevity usually involve phylogenetic selection tests on candidate genes, detections of convergent amino acid changes in long-lived lineages, analyses of differential gene expression between age cohorts or species, and measurements of age-related epigenetic changes. However, the link between gene duplication and evolution of mammalian longevity has not been widely investigated. Here, we explored the association between gene duplication and mammalian lifespan by analyzing 287 human longevity-associated genes across 37 placental mammals. We estimated that the expansion rate of these genes is eight times higher than their contraction rate across these 37 species. Using phylogenetic approaches, we identified 43 genes whose duplication levels are significantly correlated with longevity quotients (False Discovery Rate (FDR) < 0.05). In particular, the strong correlation observed for four genes (CREBBP, PIK3R1, HELLS, FOXM1) appears to be driven mainly by their high duplication levels in two ageing extremists, the naked mole rat (Heterocephalus glaber) and the greater mouse-eared bat (Myotis myotis). Further sequence and expression analyses suggest that the gene PIK3R1 may have undergone a convergent duplication event, whereby the similar region of its coding sequence was independently duplicated multiple times in both of these long-lived species. Collectively, this study identified several candidate genes whose duplications may underlie the extreme longevity in mammals, and highlighted the potential role of gene duplication in the evolution of mammalian long lifespans.© The Author(s) 2023.

Since ancient times, rhabdoviruses have caused fatal encephalitis in humans which has led to research into effective strategies for their eradication. Modelling of potential future cross-species virus transmissions forms a substantial component of the recent infection biology of rabies. In this article, we summarise the available data on the phylogeography of both bats and lyssaviruses in Europe and the adjacent reg ions, especially in the contact zone between the Palearctic and Ethiopian realms. Within these zones, three bat families are present with high potential for cross-species transmission and the spread of lyssaviruses in Phylogroup II to Europe (part of the western Palearctic). The lack of effective therapies for rabies viruses in Phylogroup II and the most divergent lyssaviruses generates impetus for additional phylogenetic and virological research within this geographical region."

Meta-analyses suggest that the virulence of emerging zoonoses is correlated with but not completely predictable from reservoir host phylogeny, indicating that specific characteristics of reservoir host immunology and life history may drive the evolution of viral traits responsible for cross-species virulence. In particular, bats host viruses that cause higher case fatality rates upon spillover to humans than those derived from any other mammal, a phenomenon that cannot be explained by phylogenetic distance alone. In order to disentangle the fundamental drivers of these patterns, we develop a nested modeling framework that highlights mechanisms that underpin the evolution of viral traits in reservoir hosts that cause virulence following cross-species emergence. We apply this framework to generate virulence predictions for viral zoonoses derived from diverse mammalian reservoirs, recapturing trends in virus-induced human mortality rates reported in the literature. Notably, our work offers a mechanistic hypothesis to explain the extreme virulence of bat-borne zoonoses and, more generally, demonstrates how key differences in reservoir host longevity, viral tolerance, and constitutive immunity impact the evolution of viral traits that cause virulence following spillover to humans. Our theoretical framework offers a series of testable questions and predictions designed to stimulate future work comparing cross-species virulence evolution in zoonotic viruses derived from diverse mammalian hosts.Copyright: © 2023 Brook et al.

It is recognized as a complex trait that integrates multiple biological pathways orchestrated in and by various tissues. This study aims to determine networks between biological entities to explain inter-individual variation of feed efficiency in growing pigs.The feed conversion ratio (FCR), a measure of feed efficiency, and its two component traits, average daily gain and average daily feed intake, were obtained from 47 growing pigs from a divergent selection for residual feed intake and fed high-starch or high-fat high-fiber diets during 58 days. Datasets of transcriptomics (60 k porcine microarray) in the whole blood and metabolomics (1H-NMR analysis and target gas chromatography) in plasma were available for all pigs at the end of the trial. A weighted gene co-expression network was built from the transcriptomics dataset, resulting in 33 modules of co-expressed molecular probes. The eigengenes of eight of these modules were significantly ([Formula: see text]) or tended to be ([Formula: see text]) correlated to FCR. Great homogeneity in the enriched biological pathways was observed in these modules, suggesting co-expressed and co-regulated constitutive genes. They were mainly enriched in genes participating to immune and defense-related processes, and to a lesser extent, to translation, cell development or learning. They were also generally associated with growth rate and percentage of lean mass. In the whole network, only one module composed of genes participating to the response to substances, was significantly associated with daily feed intake and body adiposity. The plasma profiles in circulating metabolites and in fatty acids were summarized by weighted linear combinations using a dimensionality reduction method. Close association was thus found between a module composed of co-expressed genes participating to T cell receptor signaling and cell development process in the whole blood and related to FCR, and the circulating concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids in plasma.These systemic approaches have highlighted networks of entities driving key biological processes involved in the phenotypic difference in feed efficiency between animals.

However, the changes to the DNA sequence that are mediated by CRISPR/Cas9 affect the structures and stability of the genome, which may affect the accuracy of results. Mutations in the RuvC and HNH regions of the Cas9 protein lead to the inactivation of Cas9 into dCas9 with no endonuclease activity. Despite the loss of endonuclease activity, dCas9 can still bind the DNA strand using guide RNA. Recently, proteins with active/inhibitory effects have been linked to the end of the dCas9 protein to form fusion proteins with transcriptional active/inhibitory effects, named CRISPRa and CRISPRi, respectively. These CRISPR tools mediate the transcription activity of protein-coding and non-coding genes by regulating the chromosomal modification states of target gene promoters, enhancers, and other functional elements. Here, we highlight the epigenetic mechanisms and applications of the common CRISPR/dCas9 tools, by which we hope to provide a reference for future related gene regulation, gene function, high-throughput target gene screening, and disease treatment."

Here, we compared state-of-the-art BEs and PEs and Cas9 in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells with respect to editing efficiency, cytotoxicity, transcriptomic changes and on-target and genome-wide genotoxicity. BEs and PEs induced detrimental transcriptional responses that reduced editing efficiency and hematopoietic repopulation in xenotransplants and also generated DNA double-strand breaks and genotoxic byproducts, including deletions and translocations, at a lower frequency than Cas9. These effects were strongest for cytidine BEs due to suboptimal inhibition of base excision repair and were mitigated by tailoring delivery timing and editor expression through optimized mRNA design. However, BEs altered the mutational landscape of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells across the genome by increasing the load and relative proportions of nucleotide variants.

However, clinical diagnosis remains challenging, with misdiagnoses and underdiagnoses being prevalent. There is an increased focus on putative, blood-based biomarkers that may be useful for the diagnosis as well as early detection of AD. In the present study, we used an unbiased combination of machine learning and functional network analyses to identify blood gene biomarker candidates in AD. Using supervised machine learning, we also determined whether these candidates were indeed unique to AD or whether they were indicative of other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Our analyses showed that genes involved in spliceosome assembly, RNA binding, transcription, protein synthesis, mitoribosomes, and NADH dehydrogenase were the best-performing genes for identifying AD patients relative to cognitively healthy controls. This transcriptomic signature, however, was not unique to AD, and subsequent machine learning showed that this signature could also predict PD and ALS relative to controls without neurodegenerative disease. Combined, our results suggest that mRNA from whole blood can indeed be used to screen for patients with neurodegeneration but may be less effective in diagnosing the specific neurodegenerative disease."

Cardiomyocyte-specific ADK/IGF-1-knockout mice were used for mechanistic experiments.Cardiomyocyte-specific ADK knockout enhanced glucose metabolism and ameliorated myocardial I/R injury in vivo. Mechanistically, ADK deletion caused cellular adenosine accumulation, decreased DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) expression and caused hypomethylation of multiple metabolic genes, including insulin growth factor 1 (IGF-1). DNMT1 overexpression abrogated these beneficial effects by enhancing apoptosis and decreasing IGF-1 expression. Inhibition of IGF-1 signaling with OSI-906 or genetic knocking down of IGF-1 also abrogated the cardioprotective effects of ADK knockout, revealing the therapeutic potential of increasing IGF-1 expression in attenuating myocardial I/R injury. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that cardiomyocyte ADK deletion ameliorates myocardial I/R injury via epigenetic upregulation of IGF-1 expression via the cardiomyocyte adenosine/DNMT1/IGF-1 axis.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

LLPS may lead to the assemblage of cellular structures with liquid-like fluidity, such as germ granules, stress granules, and nucleoli, which are classic membraneless organelles. These structures are typically formed through the high-concentration liquid aggregation of biomacromolecules driven by weak multivalent interactions. LLPS is involved in regulating various intracellular life activities and its dysregulation may cause the disruption of cellular functions, thereby contributing to the pathogenesis and development of neurodegenerative diseases, infectious diseases, cancers, etc. Herein, we summarized published findings on the LLPS dynamics of membraneless organelles in physiological and pathological cell fate transition, revealing their crucial roles in cell differentiation, development, and various pathogenic processes. This paper provides a fresh theoretical framework and potential therapeutic targets for LLPS-related studies, opening new avenues for future research.Copyright© by Editorial Board of Journal of Sichuan University (Medical Sciences)."

In humans, hyperinsulinemia and concomitant insulin resistance are associated with an elevated risk of age-related diseases suggestive of a shortened healthspan. Age-related disorders include neurodegenerative diseases, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes. High ambient insulin concentrations promote increased lipogenesis and fat storage, heightened protein synthesis and accumulation of non-functional polypeptides due to limited turnover capacity. Moreover, there is impaired autophagy activity, and less endothelial NO synthase activity. These changes are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. The cellular stress induced by anabolic activity of insulin initiates an adaptive response aiming at maintaining homeostasis, characterized by activation of the transcription factor Nrf2, of AMP activated kinase, and an unfolded protein response. This protective response is more potent in the long-lived human species than in short-lived models of aging research resulting in a stronger pro-aging impact of insulin in nematodes and fruit flies. In humans, resistance to insulin-induced cell stress decreases with age, because of an increase of insulin and insulin resistance levels but less Nrf2 activation. These detrimental changes might be contained by adopting a lifestyle that promotes low insulin/insulin resistance levels and enhances an adaptive response to cellular stress, as observed with dietary restriction or exercise.Copyright © 2023 Kolb, Kempf and Martin."

However, whether the detrimental effects occur in embryos after Cas9 treatment remains unknown. Here, using pig embryos as subjects, we observed that Cas9 protein transcribed from injected Cas9 mRNA can persist until at least the blastocyst stage. Cas9 protein alone can induce genome damage in preimplantation embryos, represented by the increased number of phosphorylated histone H2AX foci on the chromatin fiber, which led to apoptosis and decreased cell number of blastocysts. In addition, single-blastocyst RNA sequencing confirmed that Cas9 protein without sgRNAs can cause changes in the blastocyst transcriptome, depressing embryo development signal pathways, such as cell cycle, metabolism, and cellular communication-related signal pathways, while activating apoptosis and necroptosis signal pathways, which together resulted in impaired preimplantation embryonic development. These results indicated that attention should be given to the detrimental effects caused by the Cas9 protein when using CRISPR-Cas9 for germline genome editing, especially for the targeted correction of human pathological mutations using germline gene therapy.© 2023 The Author(s)."

Phenotype-correlation networks suggested roles for poorly characterized proteins through 'guilt by association' with known proteins. For complementary functional insights, we predicted Gene Ontology (GO) terms using machine learning methods exploiting protein-network and protein-homology data (NET-FF). We obtained 56,594 high-scoring GO predictions, of which 22,060 also featured high information content. Our phenotype-correlation data and NET-FF predictions showed a strong concordance with existing PomBase GO annotations and protein networks, with integrated analyses revealing 1675 novel GO predictions for 783 genes, including 47 predictions for 23 priority unstudied proteins.

Within its segregation of short nucleotide (SN-) and long patch (LP-), there are currently six known global mechanisms, with emerging work in transcription- and replication-associated BER. Knockouts (KOs) of BER genes in mouse models showed that single glycosylase knockout had minimal phenotypic impact, but the effects were clearly seen in double knockouts.

Genomic instability is considered central to the aging process, but the underlying mechanisms of DNA damage are insufficiently defined. Cells in confined environments experience forces applied to their nucleus, leading to transient nuclear envelope rupture (NER) and DNA damage. Here, we show that Lamin A/C protects lung alveolar macrophages (AMs) from NER and hallmarks of aging. AMs move within constricted spaces in the lung. Immune-specific ablation of lamin A/C results in selective depletion of AMs and heightened susceptibility to influenza virus-induced pathogenesis and lung cancer growth. Lamin A/C-deficient AMs that persist display constitutive NER marks, DNA damage and p53-dependent senescence.

We mapped the eccDNAs and performed differential analysis based on the split read signal of the eccDNAs, referred as DifCir, between the ALS and control specimens, to find differentially produced per gene circles (DPpGC) in the two groups. Compared were eccDNA abundances, length distributions and genic profiles. We further assessed proteome alterations in ALS by mass spectrometry, and matched the DPpGCs with differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in ALS. Additionally, we aligned the ALS-specific DPpGCs to ALS risk gene databases.We found a six-fold enrichment in the number of unique eccDNAs in the genotoxic ALS-model relative to controls. We uncovered a distinct genic circulome profile characterized by 225 up-DPpGCs, i.e., genes that produced more eccDNAs from distinct gene sequences in ALS than under control conditions. The inter-sample recurrence rate was at least 89% for the top 6 up-DPpGCs. ALS proteome analyses revealed 42 corresponding DEPs, of which 19 underlying genes were itemized for an ALS risk in GWAS databases.

Throughout a 24-hour cycle, mouse extraorbital lacrimal glands (ELGs) were collected at eight time points at three-hour intervals. To prepare for the high-throughput RNA-Seq, whole mRNA was extracted. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the young and aging groups were subjected to bioinformatic analysis based on diurnal patterns. Furthermore, the cell populations in which significant DEGs express and signaling pathways occur were validated at the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) level.The total transcriptome composition was significantly altered in aging ELGs compared with that in young mouse ELGs at eight time points during the 24-hour cycle, with 864 upregulated and 228 downregulated DEGs, which were primarily enriched in inflammatory pathways. Further comparative analysis of the point-to-point transcriptome revealed that aging ELGs underwent alterations in the temporal transcriptome profile in several pathways, including the inflammation-related, metabolism-related, mitochondrial bioenergetic function-associated, synaptome neural activity-associated, cell processes-associated, DNA processing-associated and fibrosis-associated pathways. Most of these pathways occurred separately in distinct cell populations.Transcriptome profiles of aging lacrimal glands undergo considerable diurnal time-dependent changes; this finding offers a comprehensive source of information to better understand the pathophysiology of lacrimal gland aging and its underlying mechanisms."

Yet we still know little about how social adversity impacts the immune system and how it might promote age-related diseases. Here, we investigated how immune cell diversity varied with age, sex and social adversity (operationalized as low social status) in free-ranging rhesus macaques. We found age-related signatures of immunosenescence, including lower proportions of CD20 + B cells, CD20 + /CD3 + ratio, and CD4 + /CD8 + T cell ratio - all signs of diminished antibody production. Age was associated with higher proportions of CD3 + /CD8 + Cytotoxic T cells, CD16 + /CD3- Natural Killer cells, CD3 + /CD4 + /CD25 + and CD3 + /CD8 + /CD25 + T cells, and CD14 + /CD16 + /HLA-DR + intermediate monocytes, and lower levels of CD14 + /CD16-/HLA-DR + classical monocytes, indicating greater amounts of inflammation and immune dysregulation. We also found a sex-dependent effect of exposure to social adversity (i.e., low social status). High-status males, relative to females, had higher CD20 + /CD3 + ratios and CD16 + /CD3 Natural Killer cell proportions, and lower proportions of CD8 + Cytotoxic T cells. Further, low-status females had higher proportions of cytotoxic T cells than high-status females, while the opposite was observed in males. High-status males had higher CD20 + /CD3 + ratios than low-status males. Together, our study identifies the strong age and sex-dependent effects of social adversity on immune cell proportions in a human-relevant primate model.

"883",37680454,"An evolutionary perspective on social inequality and health disparities: Insights from the producer-scrounger game.","Evol Med Public Health","There is growing concern with social disparities in health, whether relating to gender, ethnicity, caste, socio-economic position or other axes of inequality. Despite addressing inequality, evolutionary biologists have had surprisingly little to say on why human societies are prone to demonstrating exploitation. This article builds on a recent book, 'The Metabolic Ghetto', describing an overarching evolutionary framework for studying all forms of social inequality involving exploitation. The dynamic 'producer-scrounger' game, developed to model social foraging, assumes that some members of a social group produce food, and that others scrounge from them. An evolutionary stable strategy emerges when neither producers nor scroungers can increase their Darwinian fitness by changing strategy. This approach puts food systems central to all forms of human inequality, and provides a valuable lens through which to consider different forms of gender inequality, socio-economic inequality and racial/caste discrimination. Individuals that routinely adopt producer or scrounger tactics may develop divergent phenotypes. This approach can be linked with life history theory to understand how social dynamics drive health disparities. The framework differs from previous evolutionary perspectives on inequality, by focussing on the exploitation of foraging effort rather than inequality in ecological resources themselves. Health inequalities emerge where scroungers acquire different forms of power over producers, driving increasing exploitation. In racialized societies, symbolic categorization is used to systematically assign some individuals to low-rank producer roles, embedding exploitation in society. Efforts to reduce health inequalities must address the whole of society, altering producer-scrounger dynamics rather than simply targeting resources at exploited groups.© The Author(s) 2023.

However, studies regarding the morphological, anatomical and histological traits of different breeds and ages on the on knob in goose are lacking. In this study, six breeds with typical goose knob types were selected, and their knob size, morphological, anatomical and histological traits were characterized. The results showed that: Knob was more prominent in gander than in female goose, and the difference was the most obvious in Magang goose. Wanxi white goose and Shitou goose had the largest knob bulge, while Magang goose and Sichuan white goose were smaller. The total knob volume of Wanxi White goose and Shitou goose was significantly higher than that of other breeds, regardless of male or female (p< 0.05). The beak volume of Wanxi White goose and gander was significantly higher than that of other goose breeds (p< 0.05). Furthermore, the observation revealed that the ""knob"" primarily consisted of skin-derived tissue and bony protrusions. As age advances, the knob of both male and female geese undergoes synchronous development, with the knob of male geese typically surpassing that of their female counterparts during the same period. The growth rate of knob in male goose was the fastest from 70 to 120 days of age, and slowed down from 300 to 500 days of age. The growth rate of knob in female goose was slower than that in male goose. There were essential differences in the composition of Yangzhou goose knob and Magang goose knob. The subcutaneous tissue of Magang goose was rich, and the thickness of epidermis, dermis and various layers was significantly smaller than that of Yangzhou goose (p< 0.05). With the growth of goose knob, the cells of the epidermal spinous layer became denser and gradually condensed into an overall structure, and there was a clear boundary between the dermis and epidermis after adult. In adulthood, the fiber fascicle network was staggered and dense, with greater toughness and elasticity, and the stratum corneum, epidermis, reticular layer, dermis and other skin structural layers became thicker.Copyright © 2023 Zhang, Xu, Ji, Qi, Bao, Zhang, Zhang, Xu and Chen."

Extensive investigations were focused on a plethora of proinflammatory stimuli that can fuel inflammaging, underestimating and partly neglecting important endogenous anti-inflammaging mechanisms that could play a crucial role in such age-related proinflammatory state. Studies on autonomic nervous system (ANS) functions during aging highlighted an imbalance toward an overactive sympathetic nervous system (SNS) tone, promoting proinflammatory conditions, and a diminished parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) activity, playing anti-inflammatory effects mediated by the so called cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP). At the molecular level, CAP is characterized by signals communicated via the vagus nerve (with the possible involvement of the splenic nerves) through acetylcholine release to downregulate the inflammatory actions of macrophages, key players of inflammaging. Notably, decreased vagal function and increased burden of activated/senescent macrophages (macrophaging) probably precede the development of several age-related risk factors and diseases, while increased vagal function and reduced macrophaging could be associated with relevant reduction of risk profiles. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis) is another pathway related to ANS promoting some anti-inflammatory response mainly through increased cortisol levels. In this perspective review, we highlighted that CAP and HPA, representing broadly ""anti-inflammaging"" mechanisms, have a reduced efficacy and lose effectiveness in aged people, a phenomenon that could contribute to fuel inflammaging. In this framework, strategies aimed to re-balance PNS/SNS activities could be explored to modulate systemic inflammaging especially at an early subclinical stage, thus increasing the chances to reach the extreme limit of human lifespan in healthy status.© 2023.

The gene set enrichment analysis software and Molecular Signatures Database were used for functional and enrichment analysis. A protein-protein interaction network was constructed using STRING and visualized in Cytoscape. The results were compared between female and male subgroups.

The pathways enriched in the female subgroup were more similar to the pathways enriched in the older groups without taking sex difference into consideration. The pathways enriched in the female subgroup were more similar to the pathways enriched in the older groups without taking sex difference into consideration.

Given the centrality of membranes and mitochondria in complex organisms, and their evolutionary heritage from the beginnings of life, revisiting phytocannabinoid action in this light could be enlightening. For example, life can be described as a self-organising and replicating far from equilibrium dissipating system, which is defined by the movement of charge across a membrane. Hence the building evidence, at least in animals, that THC and CBD modulate mitochondrial function could be highly informative. In this paper, we offer a unique perspective to the question, why and how do compounds like CBD potentially work as medicines in so many different conditions? The answer, we suggest, is that they can modulate membrane fluidity in a number of ways and thus dissipation and engender homeostasis, particularly under stress. To understand this, we need to embrace origins of life theories, the role of mitochondria in plants and explanations of disease and ageing from an adaptive thermodynamic perspective, as well as quantum mechanics."

Using bulk-seq data of atypical endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer, we pinpointed key differentially expressed genes. Single-cell RNA sequencing was utilized for further gene expression analysis. Cluster analysis was conducted on TCGA tumor data, identifying two distinct subtypes. Statistical methods employed included LASSO regression for diagnostic modeling and various clustering algorithms for subtype identification.We found that subtype B was closely related to cellular metabolism. A diagnostic model was established using LASSO regression and was based on the genes CDH18, H19, PAGE2B, PXDN, and THRB. This model effectively differentiated the prognosis of cervical cancer. We also constructed a prognosis model and a column chart based on these key genes.Through CIBERSORT analysis, CDH18 and PAGE2B were found to be strongly associated with macrophage M0. We propose that these genes influence the transformation from atypical endometrial hyperplasia to endometrial cancer by affecting macrophage M0. In conclusion, these key genes may serve as therapeutic targets for endometrial cancer. A new endometrial cancer risk prognosis model and column chart have been constructed based on these genes, offering a reliable direction for future cervical cancer treatment.Copyright © 2023 Song, Na, Peng, Cao and Ke."

This nested biospecimen sub-study aimed to evaluate the physiological effect of multi-micronutrient-fortified BEP supplementation on pregnant and lactating women and their infants. Pregnant women (15-40 years) received either fortified BEP and iron-folic acid (IFA) (intervention) or IFA only (control) throughout pregnancy. The same women were concurrently randomized to receive either a fortified BEP supplement during the first 6 months postpartum in combination with IFA for the first 6 weeks (i.e., intervention) or the postnatal standard of care, which comprised IFA alone for 6 weeks postpartum (i.e., control). Biological specimens were collected at different timepoints. Multi-omics profiles will be characterized to assess the mediating effect of BEP supplementation on the different trial arms and its effect on maternal health, as well as birth and infant growth outcomes. The mediating effect of the exposome in the relationship between BEP supplementation and maternal health, birth outcomes and infant growth were characterized via biomonitoring markers of air pollution, mycotoxins and environmental contaminants. The results will provide holistic insight into the granular physiological effects of prenatal and postnatal BEP supplementation."

To identify genomic features associated with a variable of interest in the presence of confounders, the traditional approach involves fitting a confounder-adjusted regression model to each genomic feature, followed by multiplicity correction.This study shows that the traditional approach is suboptimal and proposes a new two-dimensional false discovery rate control framework (2DFDR+) that provides significant power improvement over the conventional method and applies to a wide range of settings. 2DFDR+ uses marginal independence test statistics as auxiliary information to filter out less promising features, and FDR control is performed based on conditional independence test statistics in the remaining features. 2DFDR+ provides (asymptotically) valid inference from samples in settings where the conditional distribution of the genomic variables given the covariate of interest and the confounders is arbitrary and completely unknown.

"898",37894353,"R-Loops in Genome Instability and Cancer.","Cancers (Basel)","R-loops are unique, three-stranded nucleic acid structures that primarily form when an RNA molecule displaces one DNA strand and anneals to the complementary DNA strand in a double-stranded DNA molecule. R-loop formation can occur during natural processes, such as transcription, in which the nascent RNA molecule remains hybridized with the template DNA strand, while the non-template DNA strand is displaced. However, R-loops can also arise due to many non-natural processes, including DNA damage, dysregulation of RNA degradation pathways, and defects in RNA processing. Despite their prevalence throughout the whole genome, R-loops are predominantly found in actively transcribed gene regions, enabling R-loops to serve seemingly controversial roles. On one hand, the pathological accumulation of R-loops contributes to genome instability, a hallmark of cancer development that plays a role in tumorigenesis, cancer progression, and therapeutic resistance. On the other hand, R-loops play critical roles in regulating essential processes, such as gene expression, chromatin organization, class-switch recombination, mitochondrial DNA replication, and DNA repair. In this review, we summarize discoveries related to the formation, suppression, and removal of R-loops and their influence on genome instability, DNA repair, and oncogenic events. We have also discussed therapeutical opportunities by targeting pathological R-loops."

We have shown that RG108, an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), impaired long-term context memory in snails, and this impairment can be reversed within a limited time window: no more than 48 h. Research on the mechanisms through which the long-term context memory impaired by DNMT inhibition could be reinstated demonstrated that this effect depends on several biochemical mechanisms: nitric oxide synthesis, protein synthesis, and activity of the serotonergic system. Memory recovery did not occur if at least one of these mechanisms was impaired. The need for the joint synergic activity of several biochemical systems for a successful memory rescue confirms the assumption that the memory recovery process depends on the process of active reconsolidation, and is not simply a passive weakening of the effect of RG108 over time. Finally, we showed that the reactivation of the impaired memory by RG108, followed by administration of histone deacetylase inhibitor sodium butyrate, led to memory recovery only within a narrow time window: no more than 48 h after memory disruption."

This review tries to provide a comprehensive assessment of state-of-the-art knowledge on omes, omics and multi-omics in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The notion and importance of omes, omics and multi-omics in both health and complex diseases like IBD is introduced, followed by a discussion of the various omics believed to be relevant to IBD pathogenesis, and how multi-omics ""big data"" can generate new insights translatable into useful clinical tools in IBD such as biomarker identification, prediction of remission and relapse, response to therapy, and precision medicine. The pitfalls and limitations of current IBD multi-omics studies are critically analyzed, revealing that, regardless of the types of omes being analyzed, the majority of current reports are still based on simple associations of descriptive retrospective data from cross-sectional patient cohorts rather than more powerful longitudinally collected prospective datasets. Given this limitation, some suggestions are provided on how IBD multi-omics data may be optimized for greater clinical and therapeutic benefit. The review concludes by forecasting the upcoming incorporation of multi-omics analyses in the routine management of IBD."

We performed whole-exome sequencing of 1,182 microbiopsies dissected from lesional and nonlesional epidermis from 111 patients with psoriasis to search for evidence that somatic mutations in keratinocytes may influence the disease process. Lesional skin remained highly polyclonal, showing no evidence of large-scale spread of clones carrying potentially pathogenic mutations. The mutation rate of keratinocytes was similarly only modestly affected by the disease. We found evidence of positive selection in previously reported driver genes NOTCH1, NOTCH2, TP53, FAT1 and PPM1D and also identified mutations in four genes (GXYLT1, CHEK2, ZFP36L2 and EEF1A1) that we hypothesize are selected for in squamous epithelium irrespective of disease status.

Centrosome abnormalities are a major driver of chromosomal instability in cancer but their origin, incidence, and composition in primary tumor cells is poorly understood. Using cutting-edge, semi-automated high-throughput electron tomography, we characterized at nanoscale 1386 centrioles in CD138posplasma cells from eight healthy donors and 21 patients with plasma cell disorders, and 722 centrioles from different control populations. In plasma cells from healthy individuals, over-elongated centrioles accumulated with age. In plasma cell disorders, centriole over-elongation was notably frequent in early, pre-malignant disease stages, became less pronounced in overt multiple myeloma, and almost entirely disappeared in aggressive plasma cell leukemia. Centrioles in other types of patient-derived B cell neoplasms showed no over-elongation. In contrast to current belief, centriole length appears to be highly variable in long-lived, healthy plasma cells, and over-elongation and structural aberrations are common in this cell type. Our data suggest that structural centrosome aberrations accumulate with age in healthy CD138posplasma cells and may thus play an important role in early aneuploidization as an oncogenic driver in plasma cell disorders.© 2023.

Tumors are formed by various cells, including immune cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts, and endothelial cells, and their tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a crucial role in malignant tumor progression and responses to therapy. ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) and AMAP1 are often overexpressed in cancers, which statistically correlates with poor outcomes. The ARF6-AMAP1 pathway promotes the intracellular dynamics and cell-surface expression of various proteins. This pathway is also a major target forKRAS/TP53mutations to cooperatively promote malignancy in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and is closely associated with immune evasion. Additionally, this pathway is important in angiogenesis, acidosis, and fibrosis associated with tumor malignancy in the TME, and its inhibition in PDAC cells results in therapeutic synergy with an anti-PD-1 antibody in vivo. Thus, the ARF6-based pathway affects the TME and the intrinsic function of tumors, leading to malignancy. Here, we discuss the potential mechanisms of this ARF6-based pathway in tumorigenesis, and novel therapeutic strategies."

Here, we leverage single-cell RNA-seq technology and introduce MERCI, a statistical deconvolution method for tracing and quantifying mitochondrial trafficking between cancer and T cells. Through rigorous benchmarking and validation, MERCI accurately predicts the recipient cells and their relative mitochondrial compositions. Application of MERCI to human cancer samples identifies a reproducible MT transfer phenotype, with its signature genes involved in cytoskeleton remodeling, energy production, and TNF-α signaling pathways. Moreover, MT transfer is associated with increased cell cycle activity and poor clinical outcome across different cancer types.

This study aimed to evaluate the methylation status ofLINE-1in tumor tissue and circulating cell-free DNA and assess its clinical significance in canine splenic hemangiosarcoma. Genomic DNA was isolated from splenic masses of 13 dogs with hemangiosarcoma, 11 with other malignant tumors, and 15 with benign lesions.LINE-1methylation was quantified using methylation-sensitive and -insensitive restriction enzyme digestion followed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Additionally, blood samples were collected from eight patients to isolate cell-free DNA to determineLINE-1methylation status changes during the treatment course.LINE-1methylation in tumor samples was significantly lower in patients with hemangiosarcoma than in those with other malignant tumors and benign lesions. Non-significant but similar results were observed for the cell-free DNA samples. Our results demonstrate thatLINE-1methylation status is a potential biomarker for splenic hemangiosarcoma."

The causes of ALS are multifactorial: known genetic mutations account for only around 70% of cases of familial ALS and 15% of sporadic cases, and heritability estimates range from 8% to 61%, indicating additional causes beyond genetics. Consequently, interest has grown in environmental contributions to ALS risk and progression. The gene-time-environment hypothesis posits that ALS onset occurs through an interaction of genes with environmental exposures during ageing. An alternative hypothesis, the multistep model of ALS, suggests that several hits, at least some of which could be environmental, are required to trigger disease onset, even in the presence of highly penetrant ALS-associated mutations. Studies have sought to characterize the ALS exposome - the lifetime accumulation of environmental exposures that increase disease risk and affect progression. Identifying the full scope of environmental toxicants that enhance ALS risk raises the prospect of preventing disease by eliminating or mitigating exposures. In this Review, we summarize the evidence for an ALS exposome, discussing the strengths and limitations of epidemiological studies that have identified contributions from various sources. We also consider potential mechanisms of exposure-mediated toxicity and suggest future directions for ALS exposome research.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."

Considering that C/EBPα-p30 inhibits the functions of C/EBPα through the LZ region, a small peptide TAT-LZ that could instantaneously interfere with the homodimerization of C/EBPα-p42 was constructed, and dynamic inhibition of C/EBPα phase separation was observed, demonstrating the importance of C/EBPα-p42 homodimers for its LLPS. Mechanistically, homodimerization of C/EBPα-p42 mediated its phosphorylation at the novel phosphorylation site S16, which promoted LLPS and subsequent AML cell differentiation. Finally, decreasing the endogenous C/EBPα-p30/C/EBPα-p42 ratio rescued the phase separation of C/EBPα in AML cells, which provided a new insight for the treatment of the AML.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Here, we show that androgen receptor (AR) forms condensates through multivalent interactions mediated by its N-terminal intrinsically disordered region (IDR) to orchestrate enhancer assembly in response to androgen signaling. AR IDR can be substituted by IDRs from selective proteins for AR condensation capacity and its function on enhancers. Expansion of the poly(Q) track within AR IDR results in a higher AR condensation propensity as measured by multiple methods, including live-cell single-molecule microscopy. Either weakening or strengthening AR condensation propensity impairs its heterotypic multivalent interactions with other enhancer components and diminishes its transcriptional activity. Our work reveals the requirement of an optimal level of AR condensation in mediating enhancer assembly and suggests that alteration of the fine-tuned multivalent IDR-IDR interactions might underlie AR-related human pathologies.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

We analysed samples from 35 patients harbouringIGHfusions (IGH::CRLF2n = 17,IGH::DUX4n = 15,IGH::EPORn = 3) and assessed the detection rates for each caller, before optimizing the parameters to enhance sensitivity forIGHfusions. Initial results showed that FusionCatcher and Arriba outperformed STAR-Fusion (85-89% vs. 29% ofIGHfusions reported). We found that extensive filtering in STAR-Fusion hinderedIGHreporting. By adjusting specific filtering steps (e.g., read support, fusion fragments per million total reads), we achieved a 94% reporting rate forIGHfusions with STAR-Fusion.

We enrolled vaginally born Latino term infants aged 2 to 6 months, includingn= 29 infants who were exposedin uteroto Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico andn= 34 infants who were conceived at least 5 months after the hurricane as controls. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed on infant stool swabs. Infants exposedin uteroto Hurricane Maria had a reduced diversity in their gut microbiome compared to the control infants, which was mainly seen in the exclusively formula-fed group (P= 0.02). Four bacterial species, includingBacteroides vulgatus,Clostridium innocuum,Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, andClostridium neonatale, were depleted in the exposure group compared to the control group. Compositional differences in the microbial community and metabolic genes between the exposure and control groups were significant, which were driven by the formula feeding group (P= 0.02 for the microbial community andP= 0.008 for the metabolic genes). Metabolic modules involved in carbohydrate metabolism were reduced in the exposure group. Prenatal maternal exposure to Hurricane Maria was associated with a reduced gut commensal and an altered microbial composition and metabolic potential in the offspring's gut. Breastfeeding can adjust the composition of the gut microbiomes of exposed infants. IMPORTANCE Climate change is a serious issue that is affecting human health. With more frequent and intense weather disasters due to climate change, there is an urgent need to evaluate and understand the impacts of prenatal disaster exposures on the offspring. The prenatal stage is a particularly vulnerable stage for disease origination. However, the impact of prenatal weather disaster exposures on the offspring's gut microbiome has not been evaluated. Our HOLA study starts to fill this knowledge gap and provides novel insights into the microbiome as a mechanism that links prenatal disaster exposures with elevated disease risks.

Pairwise pleiotropy analysis was performed to identify pleiotropic genes for significant immunophenotype-SLE pairs. A comprehensive gene function analysis was undertaken to explore the mechanisms of immune cells in SLE. By using the instrumental variables extracted from GWAS data, we observed that increased levels of five immune phenotypes were causally associated with SLE risk (FDR < 0.05), that were CD20 on IgD+CD38-naïve, BAFF-R on IgD+CD38dim, CD39+secreting Treg AC, CD14-CD16+monocyte AC, and HLA DR on CD14+monocyte. Pairwise gene-based analyses identified a total of 38 pleiotropic genes for 5 significant pairs identified and gene set enrichment analysis revealed the involvement of the identified pleiotropic genes in complex pathways (i.e., systemic lupus erythematosus, an integral component of luminal side of endoplasmic reticulum membrane, C-type lectin receptor signaling pathway and regulation of hormone secretion). This study demonstrates that the immune response influences the progression of SLE in a complex pattern. These findings greatly improve our understanding of the interaction between immune response and SLE risk and also aid in the design of therapeutic strategies from an immunological perspective.© 2023.

We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify potential candidate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that contribute to PONV by utilizing whole-genome genotyping arrays with more than 950,000 markers. The subjects were 806 patients who provided written informed consent and underwent elective surgery under general anesthesia with propofol or desflurane. The GWAS showed that two SNPs, rs2776262 and rs140703637, in theLOC100506403andCNTN5gene regions, respectively, were significantly associated with the frequency of nausea. In another GWAS conducted only on patients who received propofol, rs7212072 and rs12444143 SNPs in theSHISA6andRBFOX1gene regions, respectively, were significantly associated with the frequency of nausea as well as the rs2776262 SNP, and the rs45574836 and rs1752136 SNPs in theATP8B3andLOC105370198gene regions, respectively, were significantly associated with vomiting. Among these SNPs, clinical and SNP data were available for the rs45574836 SNP in independent subjects who underwent laparoscopic gynecological surgery, and the association was replicated in these subjects. These results indicate that these SNPs could serve as markers that predict the vulnerability to PONV. Our findings may provide valuable information for achieving satisfactory prophylactic treatment for PONV."
"921",37833897,NA,NA,"SjD (Sjögren's Disease) and SLE (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus) are similar diseases. There is extensive overlap between the two in terms of both clinical features and pathobiologic mechanisms. Shared genetic risk is a potential explanation of this overlap. In this study, we evaluated whether these diseases share causal genetic risk factors. We compared the causal genetic risk for SLE and SjD using three complementary approaches. First, we examined the published GWAS results for these two diseases by analyzing the predicted causal gene protein-protein interaction networks of both diseases. Since this method does not account for overlapping risk intervals, we examined whether such intervals also overlap. Third, we used two-sample Mendelian randomization (two sample MR) using GWAS summary statistics to determine whether risk variants for SLE are causal for SjD and vice versa. We found that both the putative causal genes and the genomic risk intervals for SLE and SjD overlap 28- and 130-times more than expected by chance (p< 1.1 × 10-24andp< 1.1 × 10-41, respectively). Further, two sample MR analysis confirmed that alone or in aggregate, SLE is likely causal for SjD and vice versa. [SjD variants predicting SLE: OR = 2.56; 95% CI (1.98-3.30);p< 1.4 × 10-13, inverse-variance weighted; SLE variants predicting SjD: OR = 1.36; 95% CI (1.26-1.47);p< 1.6 × 10-11, inverse-variance weighted]. Notably, some variants have disparate impact in terms of effect size across disease states. Overlapping causal genetic risk factors were found for both diseases using complementary approaches. These observations support the hypothesis that shared genetic factors drive the clinical and pathobiologic overlap between these diseases. Our study has implications for both differential diagnosis and future genetic studies of these two conditions."

However, the causal relationship between gut microbiota and inflammatory dermatosis remains unclear.Based on Maximum Likelihood (ML), MR-Egger regression, Inverse Variance Weighted (IVW), MR Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier (MR-PRESSO), Weighted Mode, and Weighted Median Estimator (WME) methods, we performed a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to explore the causal relationship between gut microbiota and inflammatory dermatosis. The genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data of gut microbiota came from the MiBioGen consortium, while the GWAS summary data of inflammatory dermatosis (including psoriasis, AD, rosacea, vitiligo, acne, and eczema) came from the FinnGen consortium and IEU Open GWAS project. Cochran's IVW Q test tested the heterogeneity among instrumental variables (IVs). The horizontal pleiotropy was tested by MR-Egger regression intercept analysis and MR-PRESSO analysis.Eventually, the results indicated that 5, 16, 17, 11, 15, and 12 gut microbiota had significant causal effects on psoriasis, rosacea, AD, vitiligo, acne, and eczema, respectively, including 42 protective and 34 risk causal relationships. Especially, Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria at the Family and Genus Level, as common probiotics, were identified as protective factors for the corresponding inflammatory dermatoses. The results of reverse MR analysis suggested a bidirectional causal effect between AD and genus Eubacterium brachy group, vitiligo and genus Ruminococcaceae UCG004. The causal relationship between gut microbiota and psoriasis, rosacea, acne, and eczema is unidirectional. There was no significant heterogeneity among these IVs. In conclusion, this bidirectional two-sample MR study identified 76 causal relationships between the gut microbiome and six inflammatory dermatoses, which may be helpful for the clinical prevention and treatment of inflammatory dermatoses.Copyright © 2023 Mao, Yu and Li."

Here we introduce an age-dependent topic modeling (ATM) method that provides a low-rank representation of longitudinal records of hundreds of distinct diseases in large EHR datasets. We applied ATM to 282,957 UK Biobank samples, identifying 52 diseases with heterogeneous comorbidity profiles; analyses of 211,908 All of Us samples produced concordant results. We defined subtypes of the 52 heterogeneous diseases based on their comorbidity profiles and compared genetic risk across disease subtypes using polygenic risk scores (PRSs), identifying 18 disease subtypes whose PRS differed significantly from other subtypes of the same disease. We further identified specific genetic variants with subtype-dependent effects on disease risk. In conclusion, ATM identifies disease subtypes with differential genome-wide and locus-specific genetic risk profiles.© 2023. The Author(s)."

This study aims to investigate the causal relationships between circulating levels of 20 AAs and 10 CVDs in European and East Asian populations by Mendelian randomization (MR).This MR study utilized single-nucleotide polymorphisms that were significantly associated with AAs as instrumental variables. Summary-level data for AAs and CVDs were obtained from public genome-wide association studies. The causal effects were primarily estimated by inverse variance weighting with multiplicative random effect method. Sensitivity analyses, including weighted median, weighted mode, and MR Egger regression, were used to test the robustness of our results.In the European population, alanine and serine were inversely associated with angina pectoris (AP) and chronic heart failure, respectively. With each unit increase of leucine, the risk of ischemic stroke increased by 10%. Moreover, tyrosine was positively associated with AP and deep vein thrombosis. In the East Asian population, each unit increase in glycine was associated with 4.1% and 9.0% decreased risks of coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI), respectively. A unit increase in serine was associated with 13.1%, 12.6% and 15.5% decreased risks of AP, CAD and MI, respectively. Sensitivity analyses supported the robustness of our results.This MR study demonstrated significant causal effects of circulating levels of AAs on CVDs, indicating the potential use of AAs as biomarkers or as therapeutic targets for CVD in clinical scenarios.© 2023.

Here, we evaluate the causal role of alternative splicing in COVID-19 severity and susceptibility by applying two-sample Mendelian randomization to cis-splicing quantitative trait loci and the results from COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. We identify that alternative splicing in lung, rather than total expression of OAS1, ATP11A, DPP9 and NPNT, is associated with COVID-19 severity. MUC1 and PMF1 splicing is associated with COVID-19 susceptibility. Colocalization analyses support a shared genetic mechanism between COVID-19 severity with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis at the ATP11A and DPP9 loci, and with chronic obstructive lung diseases at the NPNT locus. Last, we show that ATP11A, DPP9, NPNT, and MUC1 are highly expressed in lung alveolar epithelial cells, both in COVID-19 uninfected and infected samples. These findings clarify the importance of alternative splicing in lung for COVID-19 and respiratory diseases, providing isoform-based targets for drug discovery.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."

The relationship between the gut microbiome and autoimmune liver disease is still uncertain due to confounding variables. In our study, we aim to shed light on this relationship by employing a two-sample Mendelian randomization approach.We conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study using the R package ""TwoSampleMR"". The exposure data consisted of genetic variants associated with 194 bacterial traits obtained from the MiBioGen consortium. Summary statistics for AILD were obtained from the GWAS Catalog website. Furthermore, a series of sensitivity analyses were performed to validate the initial MR results.There were two, four and three bacteria traits associated with an increased risk of AIH.

ANGPTL8 gene variants, particularly rs2278426 leading to the R59W variant in the protein, have been associated with lipid traits in various ethnicities. We aimed to use metabolomics to understand the impact of the ANGPTL8 R59W variant on metabolites in humans. We used the Biocrates-p400 kit to quantify 408 plasma metabolites in 60 adult male Arab individuals from Kuwait and identify differences in metabolite levels between individuals carrying reference genotypes and those with carrier genotypes at ANGPTL8 rs2278426. Individuals with carrier genotypes (CT+TT) compared to those carrying the reference genotype (CC) showed statistically significant differences in the following metabolites: acylcarnitine (perturbs metabolic pathways), phosphatidylcholine (supports liver function and cholesterol levels), cholesteryl ester (brings chronic inflammatory response to lipoprotein depositions in arteries), α-aminoadipic acid (modulates glucose homeostasis), histamine (regulates glucose/lipid metabolism), sarcosine (links amino acid and lipid metabolism), diacylglycerol 42:1 (regulates homeostasis of cellular lipid stores), and lysophosphatidylcholine (regulates oxidative stress and inflammatory response). Functional aspects attributed to these metabolites indicate that the ANGPTL8 R59W variant influences the concentrations of lipid- and inflammation-related metabolites.

Th17 cells mediate immunity to Candida albicans, particularly oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC), but essential downstream mechanisms remain unclear. In the murine model of OPC, IκBζ (Nfkbiz, a non-canonical NF-κB transcription factor) was upregulated in an interleukin (IL)-17-dependent manner and was essential to prevent candidiasis. Deletion of Nfkbiz rendered mice highly susceptible to OPC. IκBζ was dispensable in hematopoietic cells and acted partially in the suprabasal oral epithelium to control OPC. One prominent IκBζ-dependent gene target was β-defensin 3 (BD3) (Defb3), an essential antimicrobial peptide. Human oral epithelial cells required IκBζ for IL-17-mediated induction of BD2 (DEFB4A, human ortholog of mouse Defb3) through binding to the DEFB4A promoter. Unexpectedly, IκBζ regulated the transcription factor Egr3, which was essential for C. albicans induction of BD2/DEFB4A.

In this study, we aimed to develop and validate a multi-modal deep learning model to predict the efficacy of bevacizumab in patients with initially unresectable CRLM using baseline PET/CT, clinical data, and colonoscopy biopsy specimens.In this multicentre cohort study, we retrospectively collected data of 307 patients with CRLM from the BECOME study (NCT01972490) (Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai) and two independent Chinese cohorts (internal validation cohort from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018 at Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University; external validation cohort from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020 at Zhongshan Hospital-Xiamen, Shanghai, and the First Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou). The main inclusion criteria were that patients with CRLM had pre-treatment PET/CT images as well as colonoscopy specimens. After extracting PET/CT features with deep neural networks (DNN) and selecting related clinical factors using LASSO analysis, a random forest classifier was built as the Deep Radiomics Bevacizumab efficacy predicting model (DERBY). Furthermore, by combining histopathological biomarkers into DERBY, we established DERBY+. The performance of model was evaluated using area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value.DERBY achieved promising performance in predicting bevacizumab sensitivity with an AUC of 0.77 and 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.67-0.87]. After combining histopathological features, we developed DERBY+, which had more robust accuracy for predicting tumour response in external validation cohort (AUC 0.83 and 95% CI [0.75-0.92], sensitivity 80.4%, specificity 76.8%). DERBY+also had prognostic value: the responders had longer progression-free survival (median progression-free survival: 9.6 vs 6.3 months, p = 0.002) and overall survival (median overall survival: 27.6 vs 18.5 months, p = 0.010) than non-responders.This multi-modal deep radiomics model, using PET/CT, clinical data and histopathological data, was able to identify patients with bevacizumab-sensitive CRLM, providing a favourable approach for precise patient treatment.

Although there was heterogeneity in terms of methodological aspects, patient differences, and techniques used, the studies found that several AI approaches are promising in terms of specificity, sensitivity, and diagnostic accuracy in the detection and diagnosis of malignant tumors. When compared to other machine learning algorithms, the Super Vector Machine method performed better in cancer detection and diagnosis. Computer-assisted detection (CAD) has shown promising in terms of aiding cancer detection, when compared to the traditional method of diagnosis.The detection and diagnosis of malignant tumors with the help of AI seems to be feasible and accurate with the use of different technologies, such as CAD systems, deep and machine learning algorithms and radiomic analysis when compared with the traditional model, although these technologies are not capable of to replace the professional radiologist in the analysis of medical images. Although there are limitations regarding the generalization for all types of cancer, these AI tools might aid professionals, serving as an auxiliary and teaching tool, especially for less trained professionals.

"940",37809326,"Liquid biopsy for early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma.","Front Med (Lausanne)","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly prevalent and lethal cancer globally. Over 90% of HCC cases arise in the context of liver cirrhosis, and the severity of the underlying liver disease or advanced tumor stage at diagnosis significantly limits treatment options. Early diagnosis is crucial, and all guidelines stress the importance of screening protocols for HCC early detection as a public health objective. As serum biomarkers are not optimal for early diagnosis, liquid biopsy has emerged as a promising tool for diagnosis, prognostication, and patients' stratification for personalized therapy in various solid tumors, including HCC. While circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are better suited for personalized therapy and prognosis, cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and extracellular vesicle-based technologies show potential for early diagnosis, HCC screening, and surveillance protocols. Evaluating the added value of liquid biopsy genetic and epigenetic biomarkers for HCC screening is a key goal in translational research. Somatic mutations commonly found in HCC can be investigated in cfDNA and plasma exosomes as genetic biomarkers. Unique methylation patterns in cfDNA or cfDNA fragmentome features have been suggested as innovative tools for early HCC detection.

"941",37886940,"Exploring the Functional Basis of Epigenetic Aging in Relation to Body Fat Phenotypes in the Norfolk Island Cohort.","Curr Issues Mol Biol","DNA methylation is an epigenetic factor that is modifiable and can change over a lifespan. While many studies have identified methylation sites (CpGs) related to aging, the relationship of these to gene function and age-related disease phenotypes remains unclear. This research explores this question by testing for the conjoint association of age-related CpGs with gene expression and the relation of these to body fat phenotypes. The study included blood-based gene transcripts and intragenic CpG methylation data from Illumina 450 K arrays in 74 healthy adults from the Norfolk Island population. First, a series of regression analyses were performed to detect associations between gene transcript level and intragenic CpGs and their conjoint relationship with age. Second, we explored how these age-related expression CpGs (eCpGs) correlated with obesity-related phenotypes, including body fat percentage, body mass index, and waist-to-hip ratio. We identified 35 age-related eCpGs associated with age. Of these, ten eCpGs were associated with at least one body fat phenotype. Collagen Type XI Alpha 2 Chain (COL11A2), Complement C1s (C1s), and four and a half LIM domains 2 (FHL2) genes were among the most significant genes with multiple eCpGs associated with both age and multiple body fat phenotypes. TheCOL11A2gene contributes to the correct assembly of the extracellular matrix in maintaining the healthy structural arrangement of various components, with theC1sgene part of complement systems functioning in inflammation. Moreover,FHL2expression was upregulated under hypermethylation in both blood and adipose tissue with aging. These results suggest new targets for future studies and require further validation to confirm the specific function of these genes on body fat regulation."

This study aimed to develop a potential model for predicting recurrence of early to mid-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using methylation loci.We used data from early to mid-stage HCC patients (TNM I-II) in the TCGA-LIHC dataset and lasso-cox regression model to identify an 18-DNA methylation site panel from which to calculate the riskScore of patients. The correlation of high/low riskScore with recurrence-free survival (RFS) and immune microenvironment in HCC patients was analyzed by bioinformatics. It was also validated in the GSE56588 dataset and the final dynamic nomogram was constructed.The results showed that riskScore was significantly correlated with RFS in HCC patients. The differential mutated genes between the two groups of HCC patients with high/low riskScore were mainly enriched in the TP53 signaling pathway. The immune microenvironment was better in HCC patients in the low-riskScore group compared to the high-riskScore group. This was validated in the GSE56588 dataset. Based on the subgroup stratification analysis of the relationship between high/low riskScore and RFS, as well as univariate and multivariate cox analyses, the riskScore was found to be independent of clinical indicators. We found that riskScore, vascular invasion and cirrhosis status could effectively differentiate RFS in HCC patients, and we also constructed prediction model based on these three factors. The model we constructed were validated in the TCGA-LIHC database and a web calculator was built for clinical use.The methylation riskScore is a predictor of RFS independent of clinical factors and can be used as a marker to predict recurrence in HCC patients.© 2023 The Authors."

The clinical data of 148 sex- and age-matched BAVMs and controls were collected, and theMTA1DNA methylation in peripheral white blood cells (WBC) was assessed by bisulfite pyrosequencing. Among them, 18 pairs of case-control samples were used for WBC mRNA detection, 32 pairs were used for WBC MTA1 protein measurement, and 50 pairs were used for plasma inflammatory factor analysis. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment was used to induce an inflammatory injury cell model of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECS). 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AZA), nicotinic acid (NA), andMTA1siRNAs were used in functional experiments to examine BMECS behaviors. RT-qPCR, Western blot, and ELISA or cytometric bead arrays were used to measure the expression levels of MTA1, cytokines, and signaling pathway proteins in human blood or BMECS. The degree ofMTA1promoter methylation was reduced in BAVM compared with the control group and was inversely proportional to MTA1 expression. Plasma ApoA concentrations in BAVM patients were significantly lower than those in controls and correlated positively withMTA1promoter methylation and negatively with MTA1 expression. The expression of cytokine was markedly higher in BAVM than in controls. Cell experiments showed that 5-AZA decreased the methylation level ofMTA1and increased the expression of MTA1 protein. LPS treatment significantly increased cytokine concentrations (p< 0.05). NA and MTA1 silencing could effectively reverse the LPS-mediated increase in IL-6 and TNF-α expression through the NF-κB pathway. Our study indicated that NA may regulate MTA1 expression by affecting promoter DNA methylation, improve vascular inflammation through the NF-κB pathway, and alleviate the pathological development of BAVM."

We propose a three-type stochastic branching process, which accounts for stem, transit-amplifying (TA) and fully differentiated (FD) cells, to model the dynamics of cell populations residing in colonic crypts. Our model is simple in its formulation, allowing us to estimate all but one of the model parameters from the literature. Fitting the single remaining parameter, we find that model results agree well with data from healthy human colonic crypts, capturing the considerable variance in population sizes observed experimentally. Importantly, our model predicts a steady-state population in healthy colonic crypts for relevant parameter values. We show thatAPCandKRASmutations, the most significant early alterations leading to colorectal cancer, result in increased steady-state populations in mutated crypts, in agreement with experimental results. Finally, our model predicts a simple condition for unbounded growth of cells in a crypt, corresponding to colorectal malignancy. This is predicted to occur when the division rate of TA cells exceeds their differentiation rate, with implications for therapeutic cancer prevention strategies."

PCa heterogeneity, therapy resistance, stemness, and lethal progression have been attributed to lineage plasticity, which refers to the ability of neoplastic cells to undergo phenotypic changes under microenvironmental pressures by switching between developmental cell states. What remains to be elucidated is how to identify measurements of lineage plasticity, how to implement them to inform preclinical and clinical research, and, further, how to classify patients and inform therapeutic strategies in the clinic. Recent research has highlighted the crucial role of next-generation sequencing technologies in identifying potential biomarkers associated with lineage plasticity. Here, we review the genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenetic events that have been described in PCa and highlight those with significance for lineage plasticity. We further focus on their relevance in PCa research and their benefits in PCa patient classification. Finally, we explore ways in which bioinformatic analyses can be used to determine lineage plasticity based on large omics analyses and algorithms that can shed light on upstream and downstream events. Most importantly, an integrated multiomics approach may soon allow for the identification of a lineage plasticity signature, which would revolutionize the molecular classification of PCa patients."

Endocrine stress during pregnancy can modulate nutrient availability from mother to fetus, alter fetoplacental growth and reproductive functions. Endocrine disrupters such as bisphenols (BPs) and phthalates are exposed in our daily life's highest volume. Therefore, they are extensively scrutinized for their effects on metabolism, steroidogenesis, insulin signaling, and inflammation involving obesity, diabetes, and the reproductive system. BPs have their structural similarity to 17-β estradiol and their ability to bind as an agonist or antagonist to estrogen receptors to elicit an adverse response to the function of the endocrine and reproductive system. While adults can negate the adverse effects of these endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), fetuses do not equip themselves with enzymatic machinery to catabolize their conjugates. Therefore, EDC exposure makes the fetoplacental developmental window vulnerable to programmingin utero. On the one hand prenatal BPs and phthalates exposure can impair the structure and function of the ovary and uterus, resulting in placental vascular defects, inappropriate placental expression of angiogenic growth factors due to altered hypothalamic response, expression of nutrient transporters, and epigenetic changes associated with maternal endocrine stress. On the other, their exposure during pregnancy can affect the offspring's metabolic, endocrine and reproductive functions by altering fetoplacental programming. This review highlights the latest development in maternal metabolic and endocrine modulations from exposure to estrogenic mimic chemicals on subcellular and transgenerational changes in placental development and its effects on fetal growth, size, and metabolic & reproductive functions.Copyright © 2023 Basak, Varma and Duttaroy."

Accurate classification of these subgroups is crucial for appropriate treatment, monitoring plans, and targeted therapies. However, misclassification between groups 3 and 4 is common. To address this issue, an AI-based R package called MBMethPred was developed based on DNA methylation and gene expression profiles of 763 medulloblastoma samples to classify subgroups using machine learning and neural network models. The developed prediction models achieved a classification accuracy of over 96% for subgroup classification by using 399 CpGs as prediction biomarkers. We also assessed the prognostic relevance of prediction biomarkers using survival analysis. Furthermore, we identified subgroup-specific drivers of medulloblastoma using functional enrichment analysis, Shapley values, and gene network analysis. In particular, the genes involved in the nervous system development process have the potential to separate medulloblastoma subgroups with 99% accuracy.

Nonlinear ML methods often achieve accurate predictions, for instance, in personalized medicine, as they are capable of modeling complex relationships between features and the target. Problematically, ML models and their predictions can be biased by confounding information present in the features. To remove this spurious signal, researchers often employ featurewise linear confound regression (CR). While this is considered a standard approach for dealing with confounding, possible pitfalls of using CR in ML pipelines are not fully understood.We provide new evidence that, contrary to general expectations, linear confound regression can increase the risk of confounding when combined with nonlinear ML approaches. Using a simple framework that uses the target as a confound, we show that information leaked via CR can increase null or moderate effects to near-perfect prediction. By shuffling the features, we provide evidence that this increase is indeed due to confound-leakage and not due to revealing of information. We then demonstrate the danger of confound-leakage in a real-world clinical application where the accuracy of predicting attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is overestimated using speech-derived features when using depression as a confound.Mishandling or even amplifying confounding effects when building ML models due to confound-leakage, as shown, can lead to untrustworthy, biased, and unfair predictions.

Recently, there have been numerous computational methods developed to predict human essential genes from population genomic data. While the existing methods are highly predictive of essential genes of long length, they have limited power in pinpointing short essential genes due to the sparsity of polymorphisms in the human genome.Motivated by the premise that population and functional genomic data may provide complementary evidence for gene essentiality, here we present an evolution-based deep learning model, DeepLOF, to predict essential genes in an unsupervised manner. Unlike previous population genetic methods, DeepLOF utilizes a novel deep learning framework to integrate both population and functional genomic data, allowing us to pinpoint short essential genes that can hardly be predicted from population genomic data alone. Compared with previous methods, DeepLOF shows unmatched performance in predicting ClinGen haploinsufficient genes, mouse essential genes, and essential genes in human cell lines. Notably, at a false positive rate of 5%, DeepLOF detects 50% more ClinGen haploinsufficient genes than previous methods. Furthermore, DeepLOF discovers 109 novel essential genes that are too short to be identified by previous methods.The predictive power of DeepLOF shows that it is a compelling computational method to aid in the discovery of essential genes.© 2023.

By integrating over 30 gene-level features potentially predictive of haploinsufficiency, DosaCNV shows unmatched performance in prioritizing pathogenic deletions associated with a broad spectrum of genetic disorders. Furthermore, DosaCNV outperforms existing methods in predicting gene haploinsufficiency even though it is not trained on known haploinsufficient genes.

Then we replicated the significant associations using an independent plasma proteome GWAS (N = 10,708). Sensitivity analyses were conducted to validate the robustness of MR results. Multivariate MR and mediation analyses were conducted to evaluate the mediation effects of body mass index (BMI), type 2 diabetes (T2D), and arm tissue composition on the association between putative causal proteins and CTS. Colocalization analysis was used to examine whether the identified proteins and CTS shared causal variant(s). Finally, we evaluated druggability of the identified proteins. Ten plasma proteins were identified as putative causal markers for CTS, including sCD14, PVR, LTOR3, CTSS, SIGIRR, IFNL3, ASPN, TM11D, ASIP, and ITIH1. Sensitivity analyses and reverse MR analysis validated the robustness of their causal effects. Arm tissue composition, BMI, and T2D may play a fully/partial mediating role in the causal relationships of ASIP, TM11D, IFNL3, PVR, and LTOR3 with CTS. The association of ASPN and sCD14 with CTS were supported by colocalization analysis. Druggability assessment demonstrated that sCD14, CTSS, TM11D, and IFNL3 were potential drug therapeutic targets.

In this study, we apply two recently developed MR approaches (known as 'lifecourse' and 'tissue-partitioned' MR) to investigate lifestage-specific effects and tissues of action in the relationship between adiposity and circulating leptin levels.Genetic instruments for childhood and adult adiposity were incorporated into a multivariable MR (MVMR) framework to estimate lifestage-specific effects on leptin levels measured during early life (mean age: 10 y) in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children and in adulthood (mean age: 55 y) using summary-level data from the deCODE Health study. This was followed by partitioning body mass index (BMI) instruments into those whose effects are putatively mediated by gene expression in either subcutaneous adipose or brain tissues, followed by using MVMR to simultaneously estimate their separate effects on childhood and adult leptin levels.There was strong evidence that childhood adiposity has a direct effect on leptin levels at age 10 y in the lifecourse (β = 1.10 SD change in leptin levels, 95% CI = 0.90-1.30, p=6 × 10-28), whereas evidence of an indirect effect was found on adulthood leptin along the causal pathway involving adulthood body size (β = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.62-0.86, p=1 × 10-33). Tissue-partitioned MR analyses provided evidence to suggest that BMI exerts its effect on leptin levels during both childhood and adulthood via brain tissue-mediated pathways (β = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.22-1.36, p=6 × 10-3and β = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.32-0.69, p=1 × 10-7, respectively).Our findings demonstrate the use of lifecourse MR to disentangle direct and indirect effects of early-life exposures on time-varying complex outcomes.

We further used two-sample bi-directional MR analyses to assess if certain proteins influenced adiposity, along with other (e.g. enrichment) analyses to clarify possible mechanisms underlying the observed associations. Overall, the mean (SD) baseline BMI was 23.9 (3.3) kg/m2, with only 6% being obese (i.e. BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2). Measured and genetically-instrumented BMI was significantly associated at FDR < 0.05 with levels of 1096 (positive/inverse: 826/270) and 307 (positive/inverse: 270/37) proteins, respectively, with FABP4, LEP, IL1RN, LSP1, GOLM2, TNFRSF6B, and ADAMTS15 showing the strongest positive and PON3, NCAN, LEPR, IGFBP2 and MOG showing the strongest inverse genetic associations. These associations were largely linear, in adiposity-to-protein direction, and replicated (> 90%) in Europeans of UKB (mean BMI 27.4 kg/m2). Enrichment analyses of the top > 50 BMI-associated proteins demonstrated their involvement in atherosclerosis, lipid metabolism, tumour progression and inflammation.

The clinical utility of the nomogram was also assessed by decision curve analysis (DCA).A total of 1,106 patients were included in this study. Among them, the malignancy rate of SPNs was 85.08% (941/1,106). We finally identified the following six independent risk factors by logistic regression: age, carcinoembryonic antigen, nodule shape, calcification, maximum diameter, and consolidation-to-tumor ratio. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for the training cohort was 0.764 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.714-0.814), and the AUC for the validation cohort was 0.729 (95% CI: 0.647-0.811), indicating that the prediction accuracy of nomogram was relatively good. The calibration curve of the predictive model also demonstrated a good calibration in both cohorts. DCA proved that the clinical prediction model was useful in clinical practice.We developed and validated a predictive model and nomogram for estimating the probability of malignancy in SPNs measuring ≤ 2 cm. With the application of predictive models, thoracic surgeons can make more rational clinical decisions while avoiding overtreatment and wasting medical resources.Copyright © 2023 Xue, Li, Wang, Liu, Liu, Li, Ma, Zhang, Tian and Tian."
"965",37792939,"Enhanced harm detection following maternal separation: Transgenerational transmission and reversibility by inhaled amiloride.","Sci Adv","Early-life adversities are associated with altered defensive responses. Here, we demonstrate that the repeated cross-fostering (RCF) paradigm of early maternal separation is associated with enhancements of distinct homeostatic reactions: hyperventilation in response to hypercapnia and nociceptive sensitivity, among the first generation of RCF-exposed animals, as well as among two successive generations of their normally reared offspring, through matrilineal transmission. Parallel enhancements of acid-sensing ion channel 1 (ASIC1), ASIC2, and ASIC3 messenger RNA transcripts were detected transgenerationally in central neurons, in the medulla oblongata, and in periaqueductal gray matter of RCF-lineage animals. A single, nebulized dose of the ASIC-antagonist amiloride renormalized respiratory and nociceptive responsiveness across the entire RCF lineage. These findings reveal how, following an early-life adversity, a biological memory reducible to a molecular sensor unfolds, shaping adaptation mechanisms over three generations. Our findings are entwined with multiple correlates of human anxiety and pain conditions and suggest nebulized amiloride as a therapeutic avenue."

In recent years, the prevalence of NAFLD has increased due to a shift towards energy-dense dietary patterns and a sedentary lifestyle. NAFLD is also strongly associated with metabolic disorders such as obesity and hyperlipidemia. The progression of NAFLD could be influenced by a variety of factors, such as diet, genetic factors, and even epigenetic factors. In contrast to genetic factors, epigenetic factors, including histone modifications, exhibit dynamic and reversible features. Therefore, the epigenetic regulation of the initiation and progression of NAFLD is one of the directions under intensive investigation in terms of pathogenic mechanisms and possible therapeutic interventions. This review aims to discuss the possible mechanisms and the crucial role of histone modifications in the framework of epigenetic regulation in NAFLD, which may provide potential therapeutic targets and a scientific basis for the treatment of NAFLD."

All procedures were performed between June 2021 and June 2023 at Guangan People's Hospital (Guangan, China). Fresh mid-morning fasting midstream urine samples were collected from a total of 30 patients with IgAN and 30 sex- and age-matched healthy volunteers. Data acquired from 6 participants are available through ProteomeXchange with the identifier PXD041151. By comparison between the IgAN group (n=3) and healthy controls (n=3) and selection criteria of P<0.05 and |log fold-change|>2, a total of 11 upregulated and 22 downregulated glycoproteins in patients with IgAN were identified. The results of Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses suggested that glycoproteins are involved in various functions, such as the regulation of cell growth, cell adhesion, cellular component organization and protein binding, as well as multiple pathways, including p53, Notch and mTOR signaling pathways. The urine levels of afamin were further measured by ELISA in a validation cohort to assess the diagnostic performance of the single indicator model. In conclusion, MS-based proteomics of urinary glycoproteins may be an alternative option for diagnosing patients with IgAN. Biomarkers of IgAN may include, but are not limited to, CCL25, PD-L1, HLA-DRB1, IL7RD and WDR82. In addition, the levels of urinary AFM indicators are of diagnostic value for IgAN.Copyright: © Liu et al."

However, the association between niacin, an important antioxidant consumed from the diet, and depression has received little attention. Therefore, we explored the association between niacin intake and depression through a cross-sectional analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2007 to 2016.Depression was measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9, score ≥ 10). Niacin intake was assessed through 24-h dietary recall interviews. The relationship of niacin intake with depression among adults in US was assessed by using a weighted multiple logistic regression model with subgroup analysis. Non-linear associations were explored using restricted cubic spline models. And we used a two-piece-wise logistic regression model with smoothing to explore the threshold for association between them.A total of 16,098 adults were included in this study. Compared with individuals with lowest niacin intake Q1 (≤ 15.96 mg/day), the adjusted OR values for dietary niacin intake and depression in Q2 (15.97-22.86 mg/day), Q3 (22.87-32.28 mg/day) and Q4 (≥ 32.29 mg/day), were 0.92 (95% CI: 0.70-1.20), 0.76 (95% CI: 0.56-0.99,) and 0.68 (95% CI: 0.48-0.98), respectively. The results were not modified by sex, by age and by BMI. Furthermore, the relationship between dietary niacin intake and depression exhibited a U-shaped curve (nonlinear, p < 0.001). And depression risk was lowest when dietary consumption of niacin was around 36 mg/day.In present study, moderate niacin intake, but not high intake, was associated with lower odds of depression suggesting a U-shaped association.© 2023.

"970",37770643,NA,NA,"Preterm birth (PTB) is the leading cause of infant mortality globally. Research has focused on developing predictive models for PTB without prioritizing cost-effective interventions. Physical activity and sleep present unique opportunities for interventions in low- and middle-income populations (LMICs). However, objective measurement of physical activity and sleep remains challenging and self-reported metrics suffer from low-resolution and accuracy. In this study, we use physical activity data collected using a wearable device comprising over 181,944 h of data across N = 1083 patients. Using a new state-of-the art deep learning time-series classification architecture, we develop a 'clock' of healthy dynamics during pregnancy by using gestational age (GA) as a surrogate for progression of pregnancy. We also develop novel interpretability algorithms that integrate unsupervised clustering, model error analysis, feature attribution, and automated actigraphy analysis, allowing for model interpretation with respect to sleep, activity, and clinical variables. Our model performs significantly better than 7 other machine learning and AI methods for modeling the progression of pregnancy. We found that deviations from a normal 'clock' of physical activity and sleep changes during pregnancy are strongly associated with pregnancy outcomes. When our model underestimates GA, there are 0.52 fewer preterm births than expected (P = 1.01e - 67, permutation test) and when our model overestimates GA, there are 1.44 times (P = 2.82e - 39, permutation test) more preterm births than expected. Model error is negatively correlated with interdaily stability (P = 0.043, Spearman's), indicating that our model assigns a more advanced GA when an individual's daily rhythms are less precise. Supporting this, our model attributes higher importance to sleep periods in predicting higher-than-actual GA, relative to lower-than-actual GA (P = 1.01e - 21, Mann-Whitney U). Combining prediction and interpretability allows us to signal when activity behaviors alter the likelihood of preterm birth and advocates for the development of clinical decision support through passive monitoring and exercise habit and sleep recommendations, which can be easily implemented in LMICs.© 2023.

Machine learning and multiomics data can potentially revolutionize clinical decision-making in FGR by identifying new phenotypes. Herein, we describe a cluster analysis of FGR based on an unbiased machine-learning method. Our resultsconfirmthe existence of two subtypes of human FGR with distinct molecular and clinical features based on multiomic analysis. In addition, we demonstrated that clusters generated by machine learning significantly outperform single data subtype analysis and biologically support the current clinical classification in predicting adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes.

These common, yet clinically disparate obstetrical syndromes share similar placental histopathologic patterns, while individuals within each syndrome present distinct molecular changes, challenging our understanding and hindering our ability to prevent and treat these syndromes.Using our extensive biobank, we identified women with severe PE (n = 75), FGR (n = 40), FGR with a hypertensive disorder (FGR + HDP; n = 33), sPTD (n = 72), and two uncomplicated control groups, term (n = 113), and preterm without PE, FGR, or sPTD (n = 16). We used placental biopsies for transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics data, and histological evaluation. After conventional pairwise comparison, we deployed an unbiased, AI-based similarity network fusion (SNF) to integrate the datatypes and identify omics-defined placental clusters. We used Bayesian model selection to compare the association between the histopathological features and disease conditions vs SNF clusters.Pairwise, disease-based comparisons exhibited relatively few differences, likely reflecting the heterogeneity of the clinical syndromes. Therefore, we deployed the unbiased, omics-based SNF method. Our analysis resulted in four distinct clusters, which were mostly dominated by a specific syndrome. Notably, the cluster dominated by early-onset PE exhibited strong placental dysfunction patterns, with weaker injury patterns in the cluster dominated by sPTD. The SNF-defined clusters exhibited better correlation with the histopathology than the predefined disease groups.Our results demonstrate that integrated omics-based SNF distinctively reclassifies placental dysfunction patterns underlying the common obstetrical syndromes, improves our understanding of the pathological processes, and could promote a search for more personalized interventions.© 2023.

PMF as well as secondary MF (post-ET and post-PV MF) are the most aggressive MPNs. Presently, there is no curative treatment, except allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. JAK inhibitors, essentially ruxolitinib, are the therapy of reference for intermediate and high-risk MF. However, presently the current JAK inhibitors behave mainly as anti-inflammatory drugs, improving general symptoms and spleen size without major impact on disease progression. A better understanding of the genetics of MF, the biology of its leukemic stem cells (LSCs), the mechanisms of fibrosis and of cytopenia and the role of inflammatory cytokines has led to new approaches with the development of numerous therapeutic agents that target epigenetic regulation, telomerase, apoptosis, cell cycle, cytokines and signaling. Furthermore, the use of a new less toxic form of interferon-α has been revived, as it is presently one of the only molecules that targets the mutated clone. These new approaches have different aims: (a) to provide alternative therapy to JAK inhibition; (b) to correct cytopenia; and (c) to inhibit fibrosis development. However, the main important goal is to find new disease modifier treatments, which will profoundly modify the progression of the disease without major toxicity. Presently the most promising approaches consist of the inhibition of telomerase and the combination of JAK2 inhibitors (ruxolitinib) with either a BCL2/BCL-xL or BET inhibitor. Yet, the most straightforward future approaches can be considered to be the development of and/or selective inhibition of JAK2V617F and the targeting MPL and calreticulin mutants by immunotherapy. It can be expected that the therapy of MF will be significantly improved in the coming years.Copyright: © 2023 Vainchenker W et al."

In cancer evolution, continuous observation of clonal architecture is impossible, and longitudinal samples from multiple timepoints are rare. Increasingly available DNA sequencing datasets at single-cell resolution enable the reconstruction of past evolution using mutational history, allowing for a better understanding of dynamics prior to detectable disease. There is an unmet need for an accurate, fast, and easy-to-use method to quantify clone growth dynamics from these datasets.We derived methods based on coalescent theory for estimating the net growth rate of clones using either reconstructed phylogenies or the number of shared mutations. We applied and validated our analytical methods for estimating the net growth rate of clones, eliminating the need for complex simulations used in previous methods. When applied to hematopoietic data, we show that our estimates may have broad applications to improve mechanistic understanding and prognostic ability. Compared to clones with a single or unknown driver mutation, clones with multiple drivers have significantly increased growth rates (median 0.94 versus 0.25 per year; P = 1.6×10-6). Further, stratifying patients with a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) by the growth rate of their fittest clone shows that higher growth rates are associated with shorter time to MPN diagnosis (median 13.9 versus 26.4 months; P = 0.0026).We developed a publicly available R package, cloneRate, to implement our methods (Package website: https://bdj34.github.io/cloneRate/).

Despite increasing evidence that highlights a pivotal role of EIF4A3 in tumor progression and immunity, a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of EIF4A3 has yet to be conducted, in order to ascertain whether EIF4A3 could be a viable biomarker for cancer screening, prediction of prognosis, and to facilitate accurate therapy design in various human malignancies. We analyzed the expression levels of EIF4A3 in bladder cancer compared to para-cancer tissue. Subsequently survival analysis was conducted to ascertain the potential association between EIF4A3 expression and patient prognosis. To further corroborate this evidence, we conducted an extensive data mining process of several publicly available databases, including UCSC Xena database, TCGA, and GTEx. Raw data from the UCSC Xena database was processed using online tools to obtain results that could be subjected to further analysis. Our study unveiled a considerable increase in the expression levels of EIF4A3 in bladder cancer compared to para-cancer tissue. Subsequent validation experiments confirmed that bladder cancer patients exhibiting higher levels of EIF4A3 expression have significantly worse prognostic outcomes. Next, our pan-cancer analysis found that the expression level of EIF4A3 is significantly higher in most cancers. Notably, high expression levels of EIF4A3 were negatively associated with patient prognosis across various cancer types. Furthermore, as a novel m6A suppressor, EIF4A3 was found to be correlated with numerous RNA modification genes in multiple cancer types. Meanwhile, analysis of publicly available databases revealed that EIF4A3 expression was significantly related to immune score and immune cell levels in most cancer types. Interestingly, EIF4A3 was also identified as a superior immunotherapy biomarker when compared to several traditional immunotherapy biomarkers. Lastly, genetic alterations analysis revealed that amplification was the most frequently occurring abnormality in the EIF4A3 gene. EIF4A3 emerges as a promising biomarker with the potential to significantly enhance tumor screening, prognostic evaluation, and the design of individualized treatment strategies across a diverse array of malignancies.© 2023.

This research was aimed at determining whether there is a correlation between H. pylori infection and CRC by measuring the prevalence of H. pylori CagA antibodies and VacA antibodies. Using data from many genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we conducted a Mendelian randomization (MR) study with two sample GWAS. Then, we used bidirectional MR to evaluate the association between H. pylori infection and CRC for identifying causation. The most common method of analysis was the inverse variance-weighted technique. In addition, we performed supplementary analyses using the weighted median technique and MR-Egger regression. Horizontal pleiotropic outliers were identified and corrected using the MR Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier (MR-PRESSO) method. Genetically predicted anti-H. pylori IgG seropositivity was not causally associated with CRC [odds ratio (OR): 1.12; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.98-1.27, P = 0.08] and neither were H. pylori VacA antibody levels (OR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.90-1.02, P = 0.25) or H. pylori CagA antibody levels (OR = 1.00, 95% CI: 0.93-1.07, P = 0.92). Furthermore, reverse MR analysis did not reveal evidence for a causal effect of CRC on H. pylori infection. The weighted median, the MR-Egger method, and MR-PRESSO yielded identical results. Using genetic data, MR analysis showed there was no evidence for a causal association between seroprevalence of H. pylori infection and CRC.

Numerous pathophysiological mechanisms, such as abnormal cell proliferation, cell differentiation, resistance to apoptosis, invasion of structures adjacent to colorectal tumor cells, and distant metastasis, are involved in colorectal carcinogenesis. These processes are initiated by the complex interaction of a number of genetic and environmental factors, including sedentary lifestyle, obesity, alcohol consumption, smoking, or gut microbiota. Despite the significant progress achieved in the diagnostic and therapeutic management of patients with colorectal cancer, there has been recently a noteworthy increase in the incidence of colorectal cancer in individuals below the age of 50 years. Early-onset colorectal cancer has a different frequency of oncogenic mutations, a higher prevalence of mucinous histology, a distinct deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation profile, a more distal location, and lower survival rates. A significant improvement in the prognosis of these patients can be achieved through the detection and removal of modifiable risk factors, along with the implementation of personalized screening strategies for individuals at high risk for this malignancy. Furthermore, gaining comprehension of the pathophysiological mechanisms by which these risk factors contribute to the process of oncogenesis may facilitate the discovery of novel therapeutic targets."

The exact pathophysiologic mechanism in the relation between (visceral) adipose tissue, systemic inflammation and colorectal cancer remains unknown. This study aimed to assess the association of lifestyle with markers of systemic inflammation at the time of diagnosis in stage I-III colorectal cancer patients. Patients (n= 298) with stage I-III colorectal cancer from three Dutch hospitals were included at diagnosis. Several lifestyle-related variables (MUST nutritional status score, WCRF/AICR healthy lifestyle score, active smoking, alcohol consumption and BMI) and inflammatory markers (plasma levels of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNFα and 'high sensitive' hsCRP) were measured at the time of diagnosis. Confounder-adjusted multivariable linear regression models were used to analyse how the lifestyle variables were associated with the inflammatory markers. Statistically significant associations were found between a better WCRF/AICR lifestyle score and lower levels of IL-6 and hsCRP. A medium and high risk of malnutrition according to the MUST score was associated with elevated levels of both IL-8 and hsCRP. An overall unhealthier lifestyle indicated by a lower WCRF/AICR lifestyle score and a higher risk of malnutrition according to the MUST score at the time of diagnosis was associated with elevated levels of inflammatory markers. These findings can contribute to formulating lifestyle advice to improve treatment outcomes and prognosis in patients having CRC in the future."

Epigenetic approaches are increasingly used to age organisms, including nonmodel organisms such as cetaceans. Māui dolphins (Cephalorhynchus hectori maui) are a critically endangered subspecies endemic to Aotearoa New Zealand, and the age structure of this population is important for informing conservation. Here we present an epigenetic clock for aging Māui and Hector's dolphins (C. h. hectori) developed from methylation data using DNA from tooth aged individuals (n = 48). Based on this training data set, the optimal model required only eight methylation sites, provided an age correlation of .95, and had a median absolute age error of 1.54 years. A leave-one-out cross-validation analysis with the same parameters resulted in an age correlation of .87 and median absolute age error of 2.09 years. To improve age estimation, we included previously published beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas) data to develop a joint beluga/dolphin clock, resulting in a clock with comparable performance and improved estimation of older individuals. Application of the models to DNA from skin biopsy samples of living Māui dolphins revealed a shift from a median age of 8-9 years to a younger population aged 7-8 years 10 years later. These models could be applied to other dolphin species and demonstrate the ability to construct a clock even when the number of known age samples is limited, removing this impediment to estimating demographic parameters vital to the conservation of critically endangered species.© 2023 The Authors.

It shows a wide spectrum ranging from subjective cognitive decline to frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and covers various cognitive domains, mainly executive/attention, language and verbal memory deficits. The frequency of cognitive impairment across the different ALS phenotypes ranges from 30% to 75%, with up to 45% fulfilling the criteria of FTD. Significant genetic, clinical, and pathological heterogeneity reflects deficits in various cognitive domains. Modern neuroimaging studies revealed frontotemporal degeneration and widespread involvement of limbic and white matter systems, with hypometabolism of the relevant areas. Morphological substrates are frontotemporal and hippocampal atrophy with synaptic loss, associated with TDP-43 and other co-pathologies, including tau deposition. Widespread functional disruptions of motor and extramotor networks, as well as of frontoparietal, frontostriatal and other connectivities, are markers for cognitive deficits in ALS. Cognitive reserve may moderate the effect of brain damage but is not protective against cognitive decline. The natural history of cognitive dysfunction in ALS and its relationship to FTD are not fully understood, although there is an overlap between the ALS variants and ALS-related frontotemporal syndromes, suggesting a differential vulnerability of motor and non-motor networks. An assessment of risks or the early detection of brain connectivity signatures before structural changes may be helpful in investigating the pathophysiological mechanisms of cognitive impairment in ALS, which might even serve as novel targets for effective disease-modifying therapies."

We performed machine learning analysis to obtain AUC values via Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Logistic Regression (LR) using cancer markers, cfDNA concentrations, and CNV screening. Furthermore, combining the analysis of all multi-omics data for ML showed higher AUC values compared with analyzing each element separately, suggesting the potential for a highly accurate diagnosis of cancer.

Recently, we proposed bimodal structure and parental functional dimorphism of the lung-specific FOXF1 enhancer, with Unit 1 having higher activity on the paternal chr16 and Unit 2 on the maternal chr16. Here, we describe a novel unusually sized pathogenic de novo copy-number variant deletion involving a portion of the FOXF1 enhancer on maternal chr16 that implies narrowing Unit 2 to an essential ~ 9-kb segment. Using a restrictase-based assay, we found that this enhancer segment is weakly methylated at ApT adenine, with about twice the frequency of methylation on the maternal versus paternal chr16. Our data provide further insight into the FOXF1 enhancer structure and function.© 2023. BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature."

Here, we report 6mA-Sniper to quantify 6mA sites in eukaryotes at single-nucleotide resolution, and delineate a 6mA profile inCaenorhabditis eleganswith 2034 sites. Twenty-six of 39 events with Mnl I restriction endonuclease sites were verified, demonstrating the feasibility of this method. The levels of 6mA sites pinpointed by 6mA-Sniper are generally increased afterPseudomonas aeruginosainfection, but decreased in strains with the removal of METL-9, the dominant 6mA methyltransferase. The enrichment of these sites on specific motif of [GC]GAG, the selective constrains on them, and their coordinated changes with METL-9 levels thus support an active shaping of the 6mA profile by methyltransferase. Moreover, for regions marked by 6mA sites that emerged after infection, an enrichment of up-regulated genes was detected, possibly mediated through a mutual exclusive cross-talk between 6mA and H3K27me3 modification. We thus highlight 6mA regulation as a previously neglected regulator in eukaryotes."

In this study, pregnant mice in the gestational days (GD, 4.5-17.5) were exposed to PFOS (0.3 and 3 μg/g of body weight). At GD 17.5, PFOS perturbed maternal lipid metabolism and upregulated metabolism-regulating hepatokines (Angptl4, Angptl8, and Selenop). Mass-spectrometry imaging and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing revealed, respectively, selective PFOS localization and deregulation of gene methylation in fetal livers, involved in inflammation, glucose, and fatty acid metabolism. PCR and Western blot analysis of lipid-laden fetal livers showed activation of AMPK signaling, accompanied by significant increases in the expression of glucose transporters (Glut2/4), hexose-phosphate sensors (RetsatandChREBP), and the key glycolytic enzyme, pyruvate kinase (Pk) for glucose catabolism. Additionally, PFOS modulated the expression levels of PPARα and PPARγ downstream target genes, which simultaneously stimulated fatty acid oxidation (Cyp4a14, Acot, andAcox) and lipogenesis (Srebp1c,Acaca, andFasn). Using human normal hepatocyte (MIHA) cells, the underlying mechanism of PFOS-elicited nuclear translocation of ChREBP, associated with a fatty acid synthesizing pathway, was revealed. Our finding implies thatin uteroPFOS exposure altered the epigenetic landscape associated with dysregulation of fetal liver metabolism, predisposing postnatal susceptibility to metabolic challenges."

Furthermore, the range of applications of NGS is rapidly expanding to include genome, epigenome (such as DNA methylation), metagenome, and transcriptome analyses (such as RNA sequencing and single-cell RNA sequencing). NGS enables genetic research by offering various sequencing methods as well as combinations of methods. Bone tissue is the most important unit supporting the body and is a reservoir of calcium and phosphate ions, which are important for physical activity. Many genetic diseases affect bone tissues, possibly because metabolic mechanisms in bone tissue are complex. For instance, the presence of specialized immune cells called osteoclasts in the bone tissue, which absorb bone tissue and interact with osteoblasts in complex ways to support normal vital functions. Moreover, the many cell types in bones exhibit cell-specific proteins for their respective activities. Mutations in the genes encoding these proteins cause a variety of genetic disorders. The relationship between age-related bone tissue fragility (also called frailty) and genetic factors has recently attracted attention. Herein, we discuss the use of genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and metagenomic analyses in bone genetic disorders."

This study will also investigate the benefits and disadvantages of web-based platforms and how they can be improved.We used quantitative and qualitative analyses in this study. We undertook a web-based questionnaire survey and semistructured qualitative interviews through Zoom. Questionnaire results were analyzed using descriptive analysis. Thematic coding with constant comparison was used for interview transcript analysis.A total of 436 respondents completed some or all of the survey. The majority of participants are female (386/413, 93.46%), and 24% (99/413) of them are in the age range of 25-34 years. Around 81% (336/413) of the participants have some type of college degree, and 55% (227/413) of them have graduate degrees. About 49.31% (204/413) of them are not currently employed. Most patients stated that their health care providers did not give accurate and complete information to them regarding their health situation (mean 2.87, SD 1.34).

We performed a large-scale genomic survey of mRNA and chromatin signatures to predict drivers ofPOLR3Gexpression in cancer. Our survey uncovers positive determinants ofPOLR3Gexpression, including a gene-internal super-enhancer bound with multiple transcription factors (TFs) that promotePOLR3Gexpression, as well as negative determinants that include gene-internal DNA methylation, retinoic-acid induced differentiation, and MXD4-mediated disruption ofPOLR3Gexpression. We show that novel TFs identified in our survey, including ZNF131 and ZNF207, functionally enhancePOLR3Gexpression, whereas MXD4 likely obstructs MYC-driven expression ofPOLR3Gand other growth-related genes. Integration of chromatin architecture and gene regulatory signatures identifies additional factors, including histone demethylase KDM5B, as likely influencers ofPOLR3Ggene activity.

Therefore, identifying factors predictive of high-risk pathological recurrence is important. However, few studies have examined the genetic status of these tumors and its relationship to prognosis.A cohort of 328 cases of primary lung cancer that underwent complete resection at Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU) was screened for 440 cancer-associated genes using panel testing. Further analyses included 92 cases of pathological stage I NSCLC who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy. Ridge regression was performed to identify association studies mutational status and postoperative recurrence. These data were then validated using clinical and genetic data from 56 patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).Mutations in TP53, RAS signaling genes KRAS and HRAS, and EGFR were recurrently detected. Ridge regression analysis relevant to recurrence, as well as survival analysis, performed using data from the TMDU cohort revealed significantly shorter relapse-free survival (RFS) for patients with RAS signaling or TP53 gene mutations than for those without (log-rank test, p = 0.00090).

Early life factors (e.g., birth weight, birth order) have been discussed to contribute to individual manifestations of functional asymmetries. However, large-scale data such as the UK Biobank suggest that the variance in handedness that is explained by early life factors is minimal. Additionally, atypical handedness has been linked to clinical outcomes such as neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Against the background of this triad, the current study investigated associations between different forms of functional asymmetries and (a) early life factors as well as (b) clinical outcomes. Functional asymmetries were determined by means of a deep phenotyping approach which notably extends previous work. In our final sample of N = 598 healthy participants, the different variables were tested for associations by means of linear regression models and group comparisons (i.e., ANOVAs and Chi-squared tests). Confirming previous findings from larger cohorts with shallow phenotyping, we found that birth factors do not explain a substantial amount of variance in functional asymmetries. Likewise, functional asymmetries did not seem to have comprehensive predictive power concerning clinical outcomes in our healthy participants. Future studies may further investigate postulated relations in healthy and clinical samples while acknowledging deep phenotyping of laterality.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."

A few studies have assessed whether asthma has ancestral associations with exposure to cigarette smoking, but results have been mixed so far.Material and methods:In this study we used four generations: (F0 great-grandparents, F1 grandparents, F2 parents, F3 study children) of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) to determine whether there is evidence of associations between asthma in generations F2 or F3 and exposures to severe trauma in childhood and/or active cigarette smoking during the adolescence of grandmothers and grandfathers in generations F0 and F1 respectively, or of a history of a F0 or F1 grandmother smoking during pregnancy.Results:We have shown that: a) stress exemplified by the death of a F1 grandparent's parent during the grandparents' childhood was associated with increased risk of asthma in generation F3, especially if the grandparent involved was the paternal grandmother; b) if the grandparents of generations F0 or F1 smoked during adolescence (i.e. < 17 years), their grandchildren in generations F2 and F3 were more likely to have a history of asthma; c) paternal F1 grandmother's smoking in pregnancy was associated with her F3 grandchild's asthma at age 7; d) There were differences between the results for the grandsons and granddaughters of the paternal grandmother with exposure to smoking in adolescence and with smoking in pregnancy. e) The addition of all of the individual exposure variables to the different analyses often provided a considerable increase in goodness of fit compared with only adding demographic factors associated with asthma atP< 0.10 such as social class; this was particularly true when all four exposure variables were combined in one model, suggesting possible synergistic effects between them.Discussion:We have shown associations between all four types of exposure to the grandparents to be associated with asthma in the grandchildren, such that the results both depended on whether the male or female line was involved, and the sex of the grandchildren. It was notable that the paternal grandmother was particularly involved in many of the associations. We emphasize that these are exploratory analyses, that asthma diagnostic criteria likely changed over time and may not be consistent between generations, and that the results should be tested in other cohorts.Copyright © 2023 Golding, Tunstall, Gregory, Granell, Dodd, Iles-Caven, Watkins and Suderman."

Deletion and mutations of its encoding gene in female mice or women lead to early embryonic developmental arrest, female infertility, maternal imprinting defects and hyperproliferation of the trophoblast. PADI6 is the fifth and least well-characterized member of the peptidyl arginine deiminases (PADIs), which catalyse the post-translational conversion of arginine to citrulline. It is less conserved than the other PADIs, and currently has no reported catalytic activity. While there are many suggested functions of PADI6 in the early mouse embryo, including in embryonic genome activation, cytoplasmic lattice formation, maternal mRNA and ribosome regulation, and organelle distribution, the molecular mechanisms of its function remain unknown. In this review, we discuss what is known about the function of PADI6 and highlight key outstanding questions that must be answered if we are to understand the crucial role it plays in early embryo development and female fertility.

Employing a sophisticated and interpretable architecture, we compare the performance of our method trained using two distinct approaches: training from scratch (SCR) and utilizing TL. Additionally, we benchmark our results against the current state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we tackle the challenges associated with selecting appropriate input features and determining optimal interval sizes. Our results show that TL enhances model performance, particularly in datasets with minimal training data, where satisfactory results can be achieved with just a few hundred RNA binding sites.

To evaluate their performance as a generalized blood-based screening approach, along with our previously reported methylation biomarker,ZNF154, we rigorously assessed each marker individually or combined. Utilizing TCGA methylation data and applying logistic regression models within each individual cancer type, we found that the three-marker combination significantly increased the average area under the ROC curve (AUC) across the 14 tumor types compared to single markers (p= 1.158 × 10-10; Friedman test). Furthermore, we simulated dilutions of tumor DNA into healthy blood cell DNA and demonstrated increased AUC of combined markers across all dilution levels. Finally, we evaluated assay performance in bisulfite sequenced DNA from patient tumors and plasma, including early-stage samples. When combining all three markers, the assay correctly identified nine out of nine lung cancer plasma samples. In patient plasma from hepatocellular carcinoma,ZNF154alone yielded the highest combined sensitivity and specificity values averaging 68% and 72%, whereas multiple markers could achieve higher sensitivity or specificity, but not both.

These effects, occurring in the course of the lytic phase of the viral life cycle, led to DDR and autophagy dysregulation. Such cellular responses, playing a key role in the maintenance of proteostasis and genome integrity, are essential to prevent carcinogenesis. Interestingly, we found that the use of the demethylating agent 5-AZA could counteract most of the effects induced by EBV infection in HCoEpC, suggesting that DNA hyper-methylation may strongly contribute to viral-driven inflammation and colon cancer predisposition.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

Placenta-specific cell types, including cytotrophoblasts, syncytiotrophoblasts, extravillous trophoblasts, and placental resident macrophage Hofbauer cells play unique roles in placental development, structure, and function. Toxicant-induced changes in relative abundance and/or impairment of these cell types likely contribute to placental pathogenesis. Although gene expression insights gained from bulk placental tissue RNA-sequencing data are useful, their interpretation is limited because bulk analysis can mask the effects of a chemical on individual populations of placental cells. Cutting-edge single cell RNA-sequencing technologies are enabling the investigation of placental cell-type specific responses to endocrine disrupting chemicals.

With a success rate of 95%, this recommendation system provides highly individualized advice, optimizing the benefits of IF for diverse population subgroups. The outcomes of this study lead us to conclude that weight is a crucial feature for females, while age plays a determining role for males in reducing glucose levels in blood.

Genomic analysis showed evidence of an extra parentally derived chromosome 1q allele in the resected brain tissue from five of six patients. This copy number gain is observed only in patient brain tissue, but not in blood or buccal cells, and is strongly enriched in astrocytes. Astrocytes carrying chromosome 1q gains exhibit distinct gene expression signatures and hyaline inclusions, supporting a novel genetic association for astrocytic inclusions in epilepsy. Further, these data demonstrate an alternate mechanism of brain chromosomal mosaicism, with parentally derived copy number gain isolated to brain, reflecting rescue in other tissues during development.© 2023.

PTATO includes a machine learning approach and filtering based on recurrence to distinguish PTA artifacts from true mutations with high sensitivity (up to 90%), outperforming existing bioinformatic approaches. Using PTATO, we demonstrate that hematopoietic stem cells of patients with Fanconi anemia, which cannot be analyzed using regular WGS, have normal somatic single base substitution burdens but increased numbers of deletions.

Although increasing evidence suggests that senescent microglia play a role in the pathogenesis of AD, their exact role remains unclear. In this study, we quantified the levels of lactic acid in senescent microglia, and hippocampus tissues of naturally aged mice and AD mice models (FAD4Tand APP/PS1). We found lactic acid levels were significantly elevated in these cells and tissues compared to their corresponding counterparts, which increased the level of pan histone lysine lactylation (Kla). We aslo identified all histone Kla sites in senescent microglia, and found that both the H3K18 lactylation (H3K18la) and Pan-Kla were significantly up-regulated in senescent microglia and hippocampus tissues of naturally aged mice and AD modeling mice. We demonstrated that enhanced H3K18la directly stimulates the NFκB signaling pathway by increasing binding to the promoter of Rela (p65) and NFκB1(p50), thereby upregulating senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) components IL-6 and IL-8. Our study provides novel insights into the physiological function of Kla and the epigenetic regulatory mechanism that regulates brain aging and AD.

As the US aging population (ages 65 +) expands, the impact will disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, e.g., Hispanic/Latino population, due to their AD-related health disparities. Age-related regression in mitochondrial activity and ethnic-specific differences in metabolic burden could potentially explain in part the racial/ethnic distinctions in etiology that exist for AD. Oxidation of guanine (G) to 8-oxo-guanine (8oxoG) is a prevalent lesion and an indicator of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Damaged mtDNA (8oxoG) can serve as an important marker of age-related systemic metabolic dysfunction and upon release into peripheral circulation may exacerbate pathophysiology contributing to AD development and/or progression. Analyzing blood samples from Mexican American (MA) and non-Hispanic White (NHW) participants enrolled in the Texas Alzheimer's Research & Care Consortium, we used blood-based measurements of 8oxoG from both buffy coat PBMCs and plasma to determine associations with population, sex, type-2 diabetes, and AD risk. Our results show that 8oxoG levels in both buffy coat and plasma were significantly associated with population, sex, years of education, and reveal a potential association with AD. Furthermore, MAs are significantly burdened by mtDNA oxidative damage in both blood fractions, which may contribute to their metabolic vulnerability to developing AD.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."

Instead of discarding missing values and related data, imputation approaches offer an alternative means of handling missing data. However, the imputation of missing omics data is a non-trivial task. Difficulties mainly come from high dimensionality, non-linear or non-monotonic relationships within features, technical variations introduced by sampling methods, sample heterogeneity, and the non-random missingness mechanism. Several advanced imputation methods, including deep learning-based methods, have been proposed to address these challenges. Due to its capability of modeling complex patterns and relationships in large and high-dimensional datasets, many researchers have adopted deep learning models to impute missing omics data. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the currently available deep learning-based methods for omics imputation from the perspective of deep generative model architectures such as autoencoder, variational autoencoder, generative adversarial networks, and Transformer, with an emphasis on multi-omics data imputation. In addition, this review also discusses the opportunities that deep learning brings and the challenges that it might face in this field."

Especially, doublet-detection methods for single-cell chromatin accessibility sequencing (scCAS) data have multiple assay-specific challenges. Therefore, we propose scIBD, a self-supervised iterative-optimizing model for boosting heterotypic doublet detection in scCAS data. scIBD introduces an adaptive strategy to simulate high-confident heterotypic doublets and self-supervise for doublet-detection in an iteratively optimizing manner. Comprehensive benchmarking on various simulated and real datasets demonstrates the outperformance and robustness of scIBD.

However, achieving accurate cell-type annotation using public references presents challenges due to inconsistent annotations, batch effects, and rare cell types. Here, we introduce SELINA (single-cell identity navigator), an integrative and automatic cell-type annotation framework based on a pre-curated reference atlas spanning various tissues. SELINA employs a multiple-adversarial domain adaptation network to remove batch effects within the reference dataset. Additionally, it enhances the annotation of less frequent cell types by synthetic minority oversampling and fits query data with the reference data using an autoencoder. SELINA culminates in the creation of a comprehensive and uniform reference atlas, encompassing 1.7 million cells covering 230 distinct human cell types. We substantiate its robustness and superiority across a multitude of human tissues. Notably, SELINA could accurately annotate cells within diverse disease contexts. SELINA provides a complete solution for human single-cell RNA-seq data annotation with both python and R packages.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"1016",37735349,NA,NA,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of genetic loci associated with kidney function. By combining these findings with post-GWAS information (e.g., statistical fine-mapping to identify independent association signals and to narrow down signals to causal variants; or different sources of annotation data), new hypotheses regarding physiology and disease aetiology can be obtained. These hypotheses need to be tested in laboratory experiments, for example, to identify new therapeutic targets. For this purpose, the evidence obtained from GWAS and post-GWAS analyses must be processed and presented in a way that they are easily accessible to kidney researchers without specific GWAS expertise. MAIN: Here we present KidneyGPS, a user-friendly web-application that combines genetic variant association for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from the Chronic Kidney Disease Genetics consortium with annotation of (i) genetic variants with functional or regulatory effects (""SNP-to-gene"" mapping), (ii) genes with kidney phenotypes in mice or human (""gene-to-phenotype""), and (iii) drugability of genes (to support re-purposing). KidneyGPS adopts a comprehensive approach summarizing evidence for all 5906 genes in the 424 GWAS loci for eGFR identified previously and the 35,885 variants in the 99% credible sets of 594 independent signals. KidneyGPS enables user-friendly access to the abundance of information by search functions for genes, variants, and regions. KidneyGPS also provides a function (""GPS tab"") to generate lists of genes with specific characteristics thus enabling customizable Gene Prioritisation (GPS). These specific characteristics can be as broad as any gene in the 424 loci with a known kidney phenotype in mice or human; or they can be highly focussed on genes mapping to genetic variants or signals with particularly with high statistical support. KidneyGPS is implemented with RShiny in a modularized fashion to facilitate update of input data ( https://kidneygps.ur.de/gps/ ).With the focus on kidney function related evidence, KidneyGPS fills a gap between large general platforms for accessing GWAS and post-GWAS results and the specific needs of the kidney research community. This makes KidneyGPS an important platform for kidney researchers to help translate in silico research results into in vitro or in vivo research.© 2023. BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature."
"1017",37841892,NA,NA,"GABAergic inhibitory neurons are the principal source of inhibition in the brain. Traditionally, their role in maintaining the balance of excitation-inhibition has been emphasized. Beyond homeostatic functions, recent circuit mapping and functional manipulation studies have revealed a wide range of specific roles that GABAergic circuits play in dynamically tilting excitation-inhibition coupling across spatio-temporal scales. These span from gating of compartment- and input-specific signaling, gain modulation, shaping input-output functions and synaptic plasticity, to generating signal-to-noise contrast, defining temporal windows for integration and rate codes, as well as organizing neural assemblies, and coordinating inter-regional synchrony. GABAergic circuits are thus instrumental in controlling single-neuron computations and behaviorally-linked network activity. The activity dependent modulation of sensory and mnemonic information processing by GABAergic circuits is pivotal for the formation and maintenance of episodic memories in the hippocampus. Here, we present an overview of the local and long-range GABAergic circuits that modulate the dynamics of excitation-inhibition and disinhibition in the main output area of the hippocampus CA1, which is crucial for episodic memory. Specifically, we link recent findings pertaining to GABAergic neuron molecular markers, electrophysiological properties, and synaptic wiring with their function at the circuit level. Lastly, given that area CA1 is particularly impaired during early stages of Alzheimer's disease, we emphasize how these GABAergic circuits may contribute to and be involved in the pathophysiology.Copyright © 2023 Hernández-Frausto, Bilash, Masurkar and Basu."

Cross-species integration of single-cell RNA-sequencing data has been particularly informative in this context. However, in order to do so robustly it is essential to have rigorous benchmarking and appropriate guidelines to ensure that integration results truly reflect biology. Here, we benchmark 28 combinations of gene homology mapping methods and data integration algorithms in a variety of biological settings. We examine the capability of each strategy to perform species-mixing of known homologous cell types and to preserve biological heterogeneity using 9 established metrics. We also develop a new biology conservation metric to address the maintenance of cell type distinguishability. Overall, scANVI, scVI and SeuratV4 methods achieve a balance between species-mixing and biology conservation. For evolutionarily distant species, including in-paralogs is beneficial. SAMap outperforms when integrating whole-body atlases between species with challenging gene homology annotation.

We used single-nucleus RNA sequencing to sample over 2.4 million brain cells across 18 locations in the common marmoset, a New World monkey primed for genetic engineering, and examined gene expression patterns of cell types within and across brain structures. The adult transcriptomic identity of most neuronal types is shaped more by developmental origin than by neurotransmitter signaling repertoire. Quantitative mapping of GABAergic types with single-molecule FISH (smFISH) reveals that interneurons in the striatum and neocortex follow distinct spatial principles, and that lateral prefrontal and other higher-order cortical association areas are distinguished by high proportions ofVIP+neurons. We use cell type-specific enhancers to drive AAV-GFP and reconstruct the morphologies of molecularly resolved interneuron types in neocortex and striatum. Our analyses highlight how lineage, local context, and functional class contribute to the transcriptional identity and biodistribution of primate brain cell types."

"1021",37793776,"Regulation of alternative splicing and polyadenylation in neurons.","Life Sci Alliance","Cell-type-specific gene expression is a fundamental feature of multicellular organisms and is achieved by combinations of regulatory strategies. Although cell-restricted transcription is perhaps the most widely studied mechanism, co-transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes are also central to the spatiotemporal control of gene functions. One general category of expression control involves the generation of multiple transcript isoforms from an individual gene, whose balance and cell specificity are frequently tightly regulated via diverse strategies. The nervous system makes particularly extensive use of cell-specific isoforms, specializing the neural function of genes that are expressed more broadly. Here, we review regulatory strategies and RNA-binding proteins that direct neural-specific isoform processing. These include various classes of alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation events, both of which broadly diversify the neural transcriptome. Importantly, global alterations of splicing and alternative polyadenylation are characteristic of many neural pathologies, and recent genetic studies demonstrate how misregulation of individual neural isoforms can directly cause mutant phenotypes.© 2023 Lee et al."

In the tissue microenvironment, one type of cells could be divided into multiple cell subgroups that function differently and communicate with other cell types or subgroups via different ligand-receptor-mediated signaling pathways. Given two cell types, we define a cell sub-crosstalk pair (CSCP) as a combination of two cell subgroups with strong and similar intercellular crosstalk signals and identify CSCPs based on coupled non-negative matrix factorization. Using single-cell spatial transcriptomics data of mouse olfactory bulb and visual cortex, we find that cells of different types within CSCPs are significantly spatially closer with each other than those in the whole single-cell spatial map. To demonstrate the utility of CSCPs, we apply 13 cell-cell communication analysis methods to sampled single-cell transcriptomics datasets at CSCP level and reveal ligand-receptor interactions masked at cell type level. Furthermore, by analyzing single-cell transcriptomics data from 29 breast cancer patients with different immunotherapy responses, we find that CSCPs are useful predictive features to discriminate patients responding to anti-PD-1 therapy from non-responders. Taken together, partitioning a cell type pair into CSCPs enables fine-grained characterization of cell-cell communication in tissue and tumor microenvironments.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."

However, available tools and transgenic models for gaining long-term genetic access to MOR+ neural cell types and circuits involved in modulating pain, analgesia and addiction across species are limited. To address this, we developed a catalog of MOR promoter (MORp) based constructs packaged into adeno-associated viral vectors that drive transgene expression in MOR+ cells. MORp constructs designed from promoter regions upstream of the mouse Oprm1 gene (mMORp) were validated for transduction efficiency and selectivity in endogenous MOR+ neurons in the brain, spinal cord, and periphery of mice, with additional studies revealing robust expression in rats, shrews, and human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived nociceptors.

However, the results were inconsistent. Therefore, we carried out a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis to examine whether an association exists between high consumption of UPF and breast cancer risk.PubMed/MEDLINE, ISI Web of Science, EBSCO and CNKI databases were systematically searched from inception to May 2023. The summary relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) associated with UPF consumption and breast cancer were calculated using a random-effects model (DerSimonian-Laird method). Heterogeneity between included studies was examined using the Cochran'sQtest and I-square (I2) statistics. Publication bias was studied by visual inspection of funnel plot asymmetry and Begg's and Egger's tests.Overall, six articles involving 462,292 participants, were eligible to be included in this study. Compared to the lowest consumption, highest consumption of UPF was related to a higher risk of breast cancer (RR = 1.10; 95%CI: 1.00-1.22,p = 0.056). Besides, the linear dose-response analysis showed that each 10% increment in UPF consumption was related to a 5% higher risk of breast cancer (RR = 1.05; 95%CI: 1.00-1.10,p = 0.048). Subgroup analyses suggested that UPF consumption was positively associated with breast cancer risk in case-control studies (RR = 1.13; 95%CI: 1.01-1.26,p = 0.028). Additionally, there was also a significant positive association between UPF consumption and breast cancer risk in the subgroup with sample size<5,000(RR = 1.17; 95%CI: 1.02-1.35,p = 0.028).Our results indicate that higher consumption of UPF is slightly related to a higher risk of breast cancer.

Such heterogeneity can be deciphered in the context of evolutionary principles, but current clinical trials do not include evolution as an essential feature. Whether or not analysis of genomic data in an evolutionary context in primary prostate cancer can provide unique added value in the research and clinical domains remains an open question.We used novel processing techniques to obtain whole genome data together with 3D anatomic and histomorphologic analysis in two men (GP5 and GP12) with high-risk PrCa undergoing radical prostatectomy. A total of 22 whole genome-sequenced sites (16 primary cancer foci and 6 lymph node metastatic) were analyzed using evolutionary reconstruction tools and spatio-evolutionary models. Probability models were used to trace spatial and chronological origins of the primary tumor and metastases, chart their genetic drivers, and distinguish metastatic and non-metastatic subclones.In patient GP5, CDK12 inactivation was among the first mutations, leading to a PrCa tandem duplicator phenotype and initiating the cancer around age 50, followed by rapid cancer evolution after age 57, and metastasis around age 59, 5 years prior to prostatectomy. In patient GP12, accelerated cancer progression was detected after age 54, and metastasis occurred around age 56, 3 years prior to prostatectomy. Multiple metastasis-originating events were identified in each patient and tracked anatomically. Metastasis from prostate to lymph nodes occurred strictly ipsilaterally in all 12 detected events. In this pilot, metastatic subclone content analysis appears to substantially enhance the identification of key drivers. Evolutionary analysis' potential impact on therapy selection appears positive in these pilot cases.PrCa evolutionary analysis allows tracking of anatomic site of origin, timing of cancer origin and spread, and distinction of metastatic-capable from non-metastatic subclones. This enables better identification of actionable targets for therapy. If extended to larger cohorts, it appears likely that similar analyses could add substantial biological insight and clinically relevant value.© 2023. BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature."

Machine learning is widely used for establishing prediction models and screening key tumor drivers. Current studies lack TF integration in TNBC, so targeted research on TF prognostic models and targeted drugs is beneficial to improve clinical translational application. The purpose of this study was to use the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator to build a prognostic TFs model after cohort normalization based on housekeeping gene expression levels. Potential targeted drugs were then screened on the basis of molecular docking, and a multi-drug combination strategy was used for both in vivo and in vitro experimental studies. The machine learning model of TFs built byE2F8,FOXM1, andMYBL2has broad applicability, with an AUC value of up to 0.877 at one year. As a high-risk clinical factor, its abnormal disorder may lead to upregulation of the activity of pathways related to cell proliferation. This model can also be used to predict the adverse effects of immunotherapy in patients with TNBC. Molecular docking was used to screen three drugs that target TFs: Trichostatin A (TSA), Doxorubicin (DOX), and Calcitriol. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that TSA + DOX was able to effectively reduce DOX dosage, and TSA + DOX + Calcitriol may be able to effectively reduce the toxic side effects of DOX on the heart. In conclusion, the machine learning model based on three TFs provides new biomarkers for clinical and prognostic diagnosis of TNBC, and the combination targeted drug strategy offers a novel research perspective for TNBC treatment."

Therefore, elucidation of molecular mechanisms in HCC biology could yield important insights for the intervention of novel therapies. Recently, various studies have reported dysregulation of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the initiation and progression of HCC, including H19; however, the biological function of H19 in HCC remains unclear. Here, we show that knockdown of H19 disrupted HCC cell growth, impaired the G1-to-S phase transition, and promoted apoptosis, while overexpression of H19 yielded the opposite results. Screening for expression of cell cycle-related genes revealed a significant downregulation of CDK6 at both RNA and protein levels upon H19 suppression. Bioinformatic analysis of the H19 sequence and the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) ofCDK6transcripts showed several binding sites for microRNA-107 (miR-107), and the dual luciferase reporter assay confirmed their direct interaction with miR-107. Consistently, blockage of miR-107 activity alleviated the growth suppression phenotypes induced by H19 downregulation, suggesting that H19 serves as a molecular sponge for miR-107 to promote CDK6 expression and cell cycle progression. Together, this study demonstrates a mechanistic function of H19 in driving the proliferation of HCC cells and suggests H19 suppression as a novel approach for HCC treatment.© 2023 Nokkeaw et al."

To uncover the functional importance of inflammasome-regulated lncRNA genes, one inflammasome-regulated lncRNA,ENSG00000273124, was knocked down in an in vitro model of macrophage polarization.

To identify BEC-enriched proteins in plasma most relevant to the maintenance of neurological and neurovascular health, we selected proteins significantly associated with 3T magnetic resonance imaging-defined white matter lesion volumes. We then examined how these candidate BEC biomarkers related to white matter lesion volumes, cerebral microhemorrhages, and lacunar infarcts in the ARIC study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities; US multisite; 1990-2017). Finally, we determined whether these candidate BEC biomarkers, when measured during midlife, were related to dementia risk over a 25-year follow-up period.Of the 28 proteins identified as BEC-enriched, 4 were significantly associated with white matter lesion volumes (CDH5 [cadherin 5], CD93 [cluster of differentiation 93], ICAM2 [intracellular adhesion molecule 2], GP1BB [glycoprotein 1b platelet subunit beta]), while another approached significance (RSPO3 [R-Spondin 3]). A composite score based on 3 of these BEC proteins accounted for 11% of variation in white matter lesion volumes in BLSA participants. We replicated the associations between the BEC composite score, CDH5, and RSPO3 with white matter lesion volumes in ARIC, and further demonstrated that the BEC composite score and RSPO3 were associated with the presence of ≥1 cerebral microhemorrhages. We also showed that the BEC composite score, CDH5, and RSPO3 were associated with 25-year dementia risk.In addition to identifying BEC proteins in plasma that relate to cerebral small vessel disease and dementia risk, we developed a composite score of plasma BEC proteins that may be used to estimate blood-brain barrier integrity and risk for adverse neurovascular outcomes."

Automated nanoparticle (NP) protein corona-based proteomics workflows can efficiently compress the dynamic range of protein abundances into a mass spectrometry (MS)-accessible detection range. This enhances the depth and scalability of quantitative MS-based methods, which can elucidate the molecular mechanisms of biological processes, discover new protein biomarkers, and improve comprehensiveness of MS-based diagnostics.Investigating multi-species spike-in experiments and a cohort, we investigated fold-change accuracy, linearity, precision, and statistical power for the using the Proteograph™Product Suite, a deep plasma proteomics workflow, in conjunction with multiple MS instruments.We show that NP-based workflows enable accurate identification (false discovery rate of 1%) of more than 6,000 proteins from plasma (Orbitrap Astral) and, compared to a gold standard neat plasma workflow that is limited to the detection of hundreds of plasma proteins, facilitate quantification of more proteins with accurate fold-changes, high linearity, and precision. Furthermore, we demonstrate high statistical power for the discovery of biomarkers in small- and large-scale cohorts.The automated NP workflow enables high-throughput, deep, and quantitative plasma proteomics investigation with sufficient power to discover new biomarker signatures with a peptide level resolution."

The conventional therapy for SCI fails to restore the lost spinal cord functions; thus, novel therapies are needed. Recent breakthroughs in stem cell biology and cell reprogramming revolutionized the field. Of them, the use of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) directly reprogrammed from non-neuronal somatic cells without transitioning through a pluripotent state is a particularly attractive strategy. This allows to ""scale up"" NPCs in vitro and, via their transplantation to the lesion area, partially compensate for the limited regenerative plasticity of the adult spinal cord in humans. As recently demonstrated in non-human primates, implanted NPCs contribute to the functional improvement of the spinal cord after injury, and works in other animal models of SCI also confirm their therapeutic value. However, direct reprogramming still remains a challenge in many aspects; one of them is low efficiency, which prevents it from finding its place in clinics yet. In this review, we describe new insights that recent works brought to the field, such as novel targets (mitochondria, nucleoli, G-quadruplexes, and others), tools, and approaches (mechanotransduction and electrical stimulation) for direct pro-neural reprogramming, including potential ones yet to be tested."

Extensive evidence demonstrates that senescent cells undergo significant changes in chromatin structure; however, the mechanisms underlying the crosstalk between epigenetic parameters and gene expression profiles have not been fully elucidated. In the present study, we delineate the genome-wide redistribution of accessible chromatin regions that lead to broad transcriptome effects during senescence. We report that distinct senescence-activated accessibility regions (SAAs) are always distributed in H3K27ac-occupied enhancer regions, where they are responsible for elevated flanking senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) expression and aberrant cellular signaling relevant to SASP secretion. Mechanistically, a single transcription factor, TEAD4, moves away from H3K27ac-labled SAAs to allow for prominent chromatin accessibility reconstruction during senescence. The enhanced SAAs signal driven by TEAD4 suppression subsequently induces a robust increase in the expression of adjacent SASP genes and the secretion of downstream factors, which contribute to the progression of senescence. Our findings illustrate a dynamic landscape of chromatin accessibility following senescence entry, and further reveal an insightful function for TEAD4 in regulating the broad chromatin state that modulates the overall transcriptional program of SASP genes.© 2023.

Cannabinoids are well-known to have bidirectional immunomodulatory activities on numerous parts of the immune system. Immune perturbations are well-known to impact the aging process, the epigenome, and intermediate metabolism. Cannabinoids also impact metabolism via many pathways. Metabolism directly impacts immune, genetic, and epigenetic processes. Synaptic activity, synaptic pruning, and, thus, the sculpting of neural circuits are based upon metabolic, immune, and epigenomic networks at the synapse, around the synapse, and in the cell body. Many neuropsychiatric disorders including depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, and autistic spectrum disorder have been linked with cannabis. Therefore, it is important to consider these features and their complex interrelationships in reaching a comprehensive understanding of cannabinoid dependence. Together these findings indicate that cannabinoid perturbations of the immunome and metabolome are important to consider alongside the well-recognized genomic and epigenomic perturbations and it is important to understand their interdependence and interconnectedness in reaching a comprehensive appreciation of the true nature of cannabinoid pathophysiology. For these reasons, a comprehensive appreciation of cannabinoid pathophysiology necessitates a coordinated multiomics investigation of cannabinoid genome-epigenome-transcriptome-metabolome-immunome, chromatin conformation, and 3D nuclear architecture which therefore form the proper mechanistic underpinning for major new and concerning epidemiological findings relating to cannabis exposure.Copyright © 2023 Reece and Hulse."

Although some methods have been identified to partly delay senescence, such as strengthening exercise, restricting diet, and some drugs, these only slow down the process of senescence and cannot fundamentally delay or even reverse senescence. Stem cell-based therapy is expected to be a potential effective way to alleviate or cure senescence-related disorders in the coming future. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are the most widely used cell type in treating various diseases due to their potentials of self-replication and multidirectional differentiation, paracrine action, and immunoregulatory effects. Some biological characteristics of MSCs can be well targeted at the pathological features of aging. Therefore, MSC-based therapy is also a promising strategy to combat senescence-related diseases. Here we review the recent progresses of MSC-based therapies in the research of age-related diseases and the challenges in clinical application, proving further insight and reference for broad application prospects of MSCs in effectively combating senesce in the future.© 2023.

Small molecule or genetic targeting of senescent β-cells has shown promise as a novel therapeutic approach for preventing and treating diabetes. Despite these advances, major questions remain around the molecular mechanisms driving senescence in the β-cell, identification of molecular markers that distinguish senescent from non-senescent β-cell subpopulations, and translation of proof-of-concept therapies into novel treatments for diabetes in humans.

We identify markers that have been used to detect β-cell senescence to unify future research efforts in this field. We discuss emerging concepts of the natural history of senescence in β-cells, heterogeneity of senescent β-cells subpopulations, role of sex differences in senescent responses, and the consequences of senescence on integrated islet function and microenvironment.

Cuproptosis is a newly discovered mode of cell death that may be related to epigenetic regulators. This study aimed to explore the association between epigenetic regulators and cuproptosis, and to establish a prognostic prediction model for COAD based on epigenetic regulators associated with cuproptosis (EACs).Methods:RNA sequencing data and clinical data of 524 COAD patients were obtained from the TCGA-COAD database, cuproptosis-related genes were from the FerrDb database, and epigenetic-related genes were from databases such as GO and EpiFactors. LASSO regression analysis and other methods were used to screen out epigenetic regulators associated with cuproptosis and prognosis. The risk score of each patient was calculated and the patients were divided into high-risk group and low-risk group. Next, the survival difference, functional enrichment analyses, tumor mutation burden, chemotherapy drug sensitivity and other indicators between the two groups were compared and analyzed.Results:We found 716 epigenetic regulators closely related to cuproptosis, among which 35 genes were related to prognosis of COAD. We further screened out 7 EACs from the 35 EACs to construct a prognostic prediction model. We calculated the risk score of each patient based on these 7 genes, and divided the patients into high-risk group and low-risk group. We found that the overall survival rate and progression-free survival rate of the high-risk group were significantly lower than those of the low-risk group. This model showed good predictive ability in the training set, test set and overall data set. We also constructed a prognostic prediction model based on risk score and other clinical features, and drew the corresponding Nomogram. In addition, we found significant differences between the high-risk group and the low-risk group in tumor mutation burden, chemotherapy drug sensitivity and other clinical aspects.Conclusion:We established an effective predictive prediction model for COAD based on EACs, revealing the association between epigenetic regulators and cuproptosis in COAD. We hope that this model can not only facilitate the treatment decision of COAD patients, but also promote the research progress in the field of cuproptosis.Copyright © 2023 Liu, Wang, Li, Feng, Liu and Ma."

In this scenario, this work provides an updated summary of the literature evidence about the role of non-coding RNAs in lung cancer screening. A literature search on PubMed was performed including studies which investigated liquid biopsy non-coding RNAs biomarker lung cancer patients and a control cohort. Micro RNAs were the most widely studied biomarkers in this setting but some preliminary evidence was found also for other non-coding RNAs, suggesting that a multi-biomarker based liquid biopsy approach could enhance their efficacy in the screening context.

"1045",37743368,NA,NA,"Chromosome stability is a key point in genome evolution, particularly that of the Y chromosome. The Y chromosome loss in blood and tumor cells is well established. Through processes that are common to other chromosomes too, the Y chromosome undergoes degradation and fragmentation in the blood stream before elimination. This process gives rise to circulating DNA (cirDNA) fragments, whose examination may provide potential insight into the role of DNA fragmentation in blood for the Y chromosome elimination. In this study, we employed shallow whole genome sequencing (sWGS) to comprehensively assess the total cirDNA and the individual chromosome fragment size profiles in the plasma of healthy male individuals. Here, we show that (i) the fragment size profiles of total circulating DNA (cirDNA) and DNA fragments originating from autosomes and the X chromosome in blood plasma are homogeneous, and have a remarkably low variability (mean CV = 7%) among healthy individuals, (ii) the Y chromosome has a distinct fragment size profile with the accumulation of the fragment < 145 bp and depletion of the dinucleosome-associated fragments (290-390 bp), and its fragment fraction in blood decreases with age. These results indicate a higher fragmentation of the Y chromosome compared to other chromosomes and this in turn might be due to its increased susceptibility to degradation. Our findings pave the way for an elucidation of the impact of chromosomal origin on DNA degradation and the Y chromosome biology.© 2023.

Nevertheless, simultaneously detecting both of them for breast cancer diagnosis has never been reported. Moreover, although fragmentation pattern of cfDNA is determined by nuclease digestion of chromatin, structure of which may be affected by DNA methylation, whether cfDNA methylation and fragmentation are biologically related or not still remains unclear.Improved cfMeDIP-seq were utilized to characterize both cfDNA methylation and fragmentation profiles in 49 plasma samples from both healthy individuals and patients with breast cancer. The feasibility of using cfDNA fragmentation profile in hypo- and hypermethylated regions as diagnostic markers for breast cancer was evaluated.Mean size of cfDNA fragments (100-220 bp) mapped to hypomethylated regions decreased more in patients with breast cancer (4.60 bp, 172.33 to 167.73 bp) than in healthy individuals (2.87 bp, 174.54 to 171.67 bp). Furthermore, proportion of short cfDNA fragments (100-150 bp) in hypomethylated regions when compared with it in hypermethylated regions was found to increase more in patients with breast cancer in two independent discovery cohort. The feasibility of using abnormality of short cfDNA fragments ratio in hypomethylated genomic regions for breast cancer diagnosis in validation cohort was evaluated. 7 out of 11 patients were detected as having breast cancer (63.6% sensitivity), whereas no healthy individuals were mis-detected (100% specificity).We identified enriched short cfDNA fragments after 5mC-immunoprecipitation (IP) in patients with breast cancer, and demonstrated the enriched short cfDNA fragments might originated from hypomethylated genomic regions.

"1047",37806992,"Spatial transcriptomics in development and disease.","Mol Biomed","The proper functioning of diverse biological systems depends on the spatial organization of their cells, a critical factor for biological processes like shaping intricate tissue functions and precisely determining cell fate. Nonetheless, conventional bulk or single-cell RNA sequencing methods were incapable of simultaneously capturing both gene expression profiles and the spatial locations of cells. Hence, a multitude of spatially resolved technologies have emerged, offering a novel dimension for investigating regional gene expression, spatial domains, and interactions between cells. Spatial transcriptomics (ST) is a method that maps gene expression in tissue while preserving spatial information. It can reveal cellular heterogeneity, spatial organization and functional interactions in complex biological systems. ST can also complement and integrate with other omics methods to provide a more comprehensive and holistic view of biological systems at multiple levels of resolution. Since the advent of ST, new methods offering higher throughput and resolution have become available, holding significant potential to expedite fresh insights into comprehending biological complexity. Consequently, a rapid increase in associated research has occurred, using these technologies to unravel the spatial complexity during developmental processes or disease conditions. In this review, we summarize the recent advancement of ST in historical, technical, and application contexts. We compare different types of ST methods based on their principles and workflows, and present the bioinformatics tools for analyzing and integrating ST data with other modalities. We also highlight the applications of ST in various domains of biomedical research, especially development and diseases.

Using an immunoprecipitation-based approach targeting histone modifications and DNA methylation, we measured 1,268 epigenomic profiles in plasma from 433 individuals with one of 15 cancers. Our assay provided a robust proxy for transcriptional activity, allowing us to infer the expression levels of diagnostic markers and drug targets, measure the activity of therapeutically targetable transcription factors and detect epigenetic mechanisms of resistance.

To avoid invasive techniques such as catheterizing the heart, improving the segmenting performance of medical echocardiographic systems can be an option to early detect diseases related to the right-side of the heart. While current medical imaging systems perform well segmenting automatically the left side of the heart, they typically struggle segmenting the right-side cavities. This paper presents a robust cardiac segmentation algorithm based on the popular U-NET architecture capable of accurately segmenting the four cavities with a reduced training dataset. Moreover, we propose two additional steps to improve the quality of the results in our machine learning model, 1) a segmentation algorithm capable of accurately detecting cone shapes (as it has been trained and refined with multiple data sources) and 2) a post-processing step which refines the shape and contours of the segmentation based on heuristics provided by the clinicians. Our results demonstrate that the proposed techniques achieve segmentation accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods in datasets commonly used for this practice, as well as in datasets compiled by our medical team. Furthermore, we tested the validity of the post-processing correction step within the same sequence of images and demonstrated its consistency with manual segmentations performed by clinicians.Copyright: © 2023 Cervantes-Guzmán et al.

Toward that end, scientific norms involve examining and criticizing the work of others and prioritizing questions that should be studied. Yet, in areas of health research where industry is active, it has often utilized well-honed strategies aimed at evading scientific standards and at dominating the research agenda, largely through its financial support and lack of transparency of its research practices. These tactics have now been documented to uniformly support industry products. Commercial entities are aided in this pursuit by public policy that has significantly embedded commercial interests and agendas into federal research funding and infrastructure. Therefore, to understand the resulting landscape and its effect on priority in health research agendas, traditional definitions of individual conflicts of interest (COI) and the less well developed institutional COI must be supplemented by a new construct of structural COI, largely operating as intellectual monopolies, in support of industry. These arrangements often result in financial and reputational resources that assure dominance of commercial priorities in research agendas, crowding out any other interests and ignoring justified returns to the public from investment of its tax dollars. There is no sustained attention to mechanisms by which public interests can be heard, normative issues raised, and then balanced with commercial interests which are transparently reported. Focus on research supporting approval of commercial products ignores social and environmental determinants of health.

CRISPR/Cas9-induced mouse liver cancer models can be used to elucidate how IGH is developed. However, as CRISPR/Cas9 could induce chromothripsis and extrachromosomal DNA in cells in addition to targeted mutations, we wondered whether this effect contributes to the development of IGH in CRISPR/Cas9-induced mouse liver cancer.CRISPR/Cas9-based targeted somatic multiplex-mutagenesis was used to target 34 tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) for induction of primary liver tumors in mice. Target site mutations in tumor cells were analyzed and compared between single-cell clones and their subclones, between different time points of cell proliferation, and between parental clones and single-cell clones derived from mouse subcutaneous allografts. Genomic instability and generation of extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) was explored as a potential mechanism underlying the oscillation of target site mutations in these liver tumor cells.After efficiently inducing autochthonous liver tumors in mice within 30-60 days, analyses of CRISPR/Cas9-induced tumors and single-cell clones derived from tumor nodules revealed multiplexed and heterogeneous mutations at target sites. Many target sites frequently displayed more than two types of allelic variations with varying frequencies in single-cell clones, indicating increased copy number of these target sites. The types and frequencies of targeted TSG mutations continued to change at some target sites between single-cell clones and their subclones. Even the proliferation of a subclone in cell culture and in mouse subcutaneous graft altered the types and frequencies of targeted TSG mutations in the absence of continuing CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, indicating a new source outside primary chromosomes for the development of IGH in these liver tumors. Karyotyping of tumor cells revealed genomic instability in these cells manifested by high levels of micronuclei and chromosomal aberrations including chromosomal fragments and chromosomal breaks. Sequencing analysis further demonstrated the generation of eccDNA harboring targeted TSG mutations in these tumor cells.Small eccDNAs carrying TSG mutations may serve as an important source supporting intratumor heterogeneity and tumor evolution in mouse liver cancer induced by multiplexed CRISPR/Cas9.© 2023.

However, eccDNAs are often lost during thein vitrogrowth of cancer cell lines, questioning the reproducibility of studies utilizing cancer cell line models. Here, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of eccDNA variability in seven cancer cell lines (MCA3D, PDV, HaCa4, CarC, MIA-PaCa-2, AsPC-1, and PC-3). We compared the content of unique eccDNAs between triplicates of each cell line and found that the number of unique eccDNA is specific to each cell line, while the eccDNA sequence content varied greatly among triplicates (∼ 0-1% eccDNA coordinate commonality). In the PC-3 cell line, we found that the large eccDNA (ecDNA) withMYCis present in high-copy number in an NCI cell line isolate but not present in ATCC isolates. Together, these results reveal that the sequence content of eccDNA is highly variable in cancer cell lines. This highlights the importance of testing cancer cell lines before use, and to enrich for subclones in cell lines with the desired eccDNA to get relatively pure population for studying the role of eccDNA in cancer.© 2023 The Authors.

The discovery of disease-associated proteins with causal genetic evidence offers a chance to uncover novel therapeutic targets.First, we comprehensively investigated the causal association between 2994 proteins and MM through two-sample mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using summary-level data from public genome-wide association studies of plasma proteome (N = 3301 healthy individuals) and MM (598 cases and 180,756 controls). Sensitivity analyses were performed for these identified causal proteins. Furthermore, we pursued the exploration of enriched biological pathways, prioritized the therapeutic proteins, and evaluated their druggability using the KEGG pathway analysis, MR-Bayesian model averaging analysis, and cross-reference with current databases, respectively.We identified 13 proteins causally associated with MM risk (false discovery rate corrected P < 0.05). Six proteins were positively associated with the risk of MM, including nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPT; OR [95% CI]: 1.35 [1.18, 1.55]), tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin-like and EGF-like domains 1 (TIE1; 1.14 [1.06, 1.22]), neutrophil cytosol factor 2 (NCF2; 1.27 [1.12, 1.44]), carbonyl reductase 1, cAMP-specific 3',5'-cyclic phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D), platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase IB subunit beta (PAFAH1B2). Seven proteins were inversely associated with MM, which referred to suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3; 0.90 [0.86, 0.94]), Fc-gamma receptor III-B (FCGR3B; 0.75 [0.65,0.86]), glypican-1 (GPC1; 0.69 [0.58,0.83]), follistatin-related protein 1, protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 4 (PTPN4), granzyme B, complement C1q subcomponent subunit C (C1QC). Three of the causal proteins, SOCS3, FCGR3B, and NCF2, were enriched in the osteoclast differentiation pathway in KEGG enrichment analyses while GPC1 (marginal inclusion probability (MIP):0.993; model averaged causal effects (MACE): - 0.349), NAMPT (MIP:0.433; MACE: - 0.113), and NCF2 (MIP:0.324; MACE:0.066) ranked among the top three MM-associated proteins according to MR-BMA analyses. Furthermore, therapeutics targeting four proteins are currently under evaluation, five are druggable and four are future breakthrough points.Our analysis revealed a set of 13 novel proteins, including six risk and seven protective proteins, causally linked to MM risk. The discovery of these MM-associated proteins opens up the possibility for identifying novel therapeutic targets, further advancing the integration of genome and proteome data for drug development.© 2023.

Intestinal dysbiosis may play a pivotal bridging role in extra-oral inflammatory comorbidities caused by periodontitis. However, it is unclear whether the link is merely correlative or orchestrated by causative mechanistic interactions. This two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study was performed to evaluate the potential bidirectional causal relationships between gut microbiota and periodontitis.A two-sample MR analysis was performed using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for gut microbiota (n = 18,340) and periodontitis (cases = 12,251; controls = 22,845). The inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method was used for the primary analysis, and we employed sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the main results. The PhenoScanner database was then searched for pleiotropy SNPs associated with potential confounders. In order to identify the possibly influential SNPs, we further conducted the leave-one-out analysis. Finally, a reverse MR analysis was performed to evaluate the possibility of links between periodontitis and genetically predicted gut microbiota alternation.2,699 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with 196 microbiota genera were selected as instrumental variables (IVs). IVW method suggested that order Enterobacteriales (OR: 1.35, 95% CI 1.10-1.66), family Bacteroidales S24.7group (OR: 1.22, 95% CI 1.05-1.41), genus Lachnospiraceae UCG008 (OR: 1.16, 95% CI 1.03-1.31), genus Prevotella 7 (OR: 1.11, 95% CI 1.01-1.23), and order Pasteurellales (OR: 1.12, 95% CI 1.00-1.26) may be associated with a higher risk of periodontitis, while genus Ruminiclostridium 6 may be linked to a lower risk (OR: 0.82, 95% CI 0.70-0.95). The sensitivity and heterogeneity analyses yielded no indication of horizontal pleiotropy or heterogeneity. Only the association between order Enterobacteriales and the likelihood of periodontitis remained consistent across all alternative MR approaches. In the reverse MR analysis, four microbiota genera were genetically predicted to be down-regulated in periodontitis, whereas two were predicted to be up-regulated.The present MR analysis demonstrated the potential bidirectional causal relationships between gut microbiota and periodontitis. Our research provided fresh insights for the prevention and management of periodontitis. Future research is required to support the finding of our current study.© 2023.

Next-generation sequencing has been well established and holds great promise to assist in the development of novel therapeutics as well as biomarkers to prevent or slow the progression of this devastating disease. Here we present a public resource of functional genomic data from the parahippocampal gyrus of 201 postmortem control, mild cognitively impaired (MCI) and AD individuals from the Mount Sinai brain bank, of which whole-genome sequencing (WGS), and bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) were previously published.

Deep metric learning has emerged as a promising approach for addressing these challenges by improving data representation. In this study, we propose a joint triplet loss model with a semi-hard constraint (JTSC) to represent data in a small number of samples. JTSC strictly selects semi-hard samples by switching anchors and positive samples during the learning process in triplet embedding and combines a triplet loss function with an angular loss function. Our results indicate that JTSC significantly improves the number of appropriately represented samples during training when applied to the gene expression data of AD and to cancer stage prediction tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that using an embedding vector from JTSC as an input to the classifiers for AD and cancer stage prediction significantly improves classification performance by extracting more accurate features. In conclusion, we show that feature embedding through JTSC can aid in classification when there are a small number of samples compared to a larger number of features.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."

This finding fostered conceptual leaps crystalized around the idea that astrocytes, once thought to be passive, participate actively in brain signaling and outputs. A multitude of disparate roles of astrocytes has since emerged, but their meaningful integration has been muddied by the lack of consensus and models of how we conceive the functional position of these cells in brain circuitry. In this Perspective, we propose an intuitive, data-driven and transferable conceptual framework we coin 'contextual guidance'. It describes astrocytes as 'contextual gates' that shape neural circuitry in an adaptive, state-dependent fashion. This paradigm provides fresh perspectives on principles of astrocyte signaling and its relevance to brain function, which could spur new experimental avenues, including in computational space.© 2023.

Astroglia contribute to the pathophysiology of all neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders in ways that can be either beneficial or detrimental to disorder outcome. Pathophysiological changes in astroglia can be primary or secondary and can result in gain or loss of functions. Astroglia respond to external, non-cell autonomous signals associated with any form of CNS pathology by undergoing complex and variable changes in their structure, molecular expression, and function. In addition, internally driven, cell autonomous changes of astroglial innate properties can lead to CNS pathologies. Astroglial pathophysiology is complex, with different pathophysiological cell states and cell phenotypes that are context-specific and vary with disorder, disorder-stage, comorbidities, age, and sex. Here, we classify astroglial pathophysiology into (i) reactive astrogliosis, (ii) astroglial atrophy with loss of function, (iii) astroglial degeneration and death, and (iv) astrocytopathies characterised by aberrant forms that drive disease. We review astroglial pathophysiology across the spectrum of human CNS diseases and disorders, including neurotrauma, stroke, neuroinfection, autoimmune attack and epilepsy, as well as neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, metabolic and neuropsychiatric disorders. Characterising cellular and molecular mechanisms of astroglial pathophysiology represents a new frontier to identify novel therapeutic strategies.© 2023. West China Hospital, Sichuan University."

Selective deletion of estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) in astrocytes, but not neurons, in gonadally intact female mice induced the same brain effects. RNA sequencing and pathway analyses of gene expression in hippocampal astrocytes from midlife female astrocyte-ERβ conditional knock out (cKO) mice revealed Gluconeogenesis I and Glycolysis I as the most differentially expressed pathways. Enolase 1 gene expression was increased in hippocampi from both astrocyte-ERβ cKO female mice at midlife and from postmenopausal women.

The genome-wide association study summary statistics data of gut microbiota (n= 18,340) was downloaded from the MiBioGen consortium and the data of sleep-related phenotypes were derived from the UK Biobank, the Medical Research Council-Integrative Epidemiology Unit, Jones SE, the FinnGen consortium. To test and estimate the causal effect of gut microbiota on sleep traits, a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach using multiple methods was conducted. A series of sensitive analyses, such as horizontal pleiotropy analysis, heterogeneity test, MR Steiger directionality test and ""leave-one-out"" analysis as well as reverse MR analysis, were conducted to assess the robustness of MR results. The genusAnaerofilumhas a negative causal effect on getting up in the morning (odd ratio = 0.977, 95% confidence interval: 0.965-0.988,p= 7.28 × 10-5).

The aim of this study was to compare patients' relative telomere length (RTL) between and within different cART classes and to estimate the impact of certain HIV-related variables on RTL. The study was conducted in 176 HIV-infected male patients receiving cART, with ≤50 copies HIV RNA/mL plasma. RTL was determined from mononuclear cells by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Standard statistical tests and unsupervised machine learning were performed. The mean RTL was 2.50 ± 1.87. There was no difference (p= 0.761) in RTL between therapeutic groups: two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors as the backbone treatment, combined with either integrase inhibitor, protease inhibitor, or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). Machine learning results suggested duration of HIV infection, CD4+ T-cell count, and cART, including NNRTI, as potentially significant variables impacting RTL. Kendall's correlation test excluded duration of HIV infection (p= 0.220) and CD4+ T-cell count (p= 0.536) as significant. The Mann-Whitney test confirmed that cART containing NNRTI impacted RTL (p= 0.018).

Among CAMs, the IgLON family comprises five members: Opioid Binding Protein/Cell Adhesion Molecule Like (OPCML or OBCAM), Limbic System Associated Membrane Protein (LSAMP), neurotrimin (NTM), Neuronal Growth Regulator 1 (NEGR1), and IgLON5. IgLONs exhibit three N-terminal C2 immunoglobulin domains; several glycosylation sites; and a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchoring to the membrane. Interactions as homo- or heterodimers incisand intrans, as well as binding to other molecules, appear critical for their functions. Shedding by metalloproteases generates soluble factors interacting with cellular receptors and activating signal transduction. The aim of this review was to analyse the available data implicating a role for IgLONs in neuropsychiatric disorders. Starting from the identification of a pathological role for antibodies against IgLON5 in an autoimmune neurodegenerative disease with a poorly understood mechanism of action, accumulating evidence links IgLONs to neuropsychiatric disorders, albeit with still undefined mechanisms which will require future thorough investigations."

Improved molecular and genetic profiling has increased our understanding of the factors which drive these clinical dynamics. Immune and non-immune cells within the lymphoma tumor microenvironment (TME) can both play a key role in antitumor immune responses and conversely also support lymphoma growth and survival. A deeper understanding of the lymphoma TME would identify key lymphoma and immune cell interactions which could be disrupted for therapeutic benefit. Single cell RNA sequencing studies have provided a more comprehensive description of the TME, however these studies are limited in that they lack spatial context. Spatial transcriptomics provides a comprehensive analysis of gene expression within tissue and is an attractive technique in lymphoma to both disentangle the complex interactions between lymphoma and TME cells and improve understanding of how lymphoma cells evade the host immune response.

Recent emerging spatial technologies such as CosMx, MERSCOPE and Xenium delineate the spatial gene expression patterns at the single cell resolution. This provides unprecedented opportunities to identify spatially localized cellular resistance and to optimize the treatment for individual patients. In this work, we present a graph-based domain adaptation model, SpaRx, to reveal the heterogeneity of spatial cellular response to drugs. SpaRx transfers the knowledge from pharmacogenomics profiles to single-cell spatial transcriptomics data, through hybrid learning with dynamic adversarial adaption. Comprehensive benchmarking demonstrates the superior and robust performance of SpaRx at different dropout rates, noise levels and transcriptomics coverage. Further application of SpaRx to the state-of-the-art single-cell spatial transcriptomics data reveals that tumor cells in different locations of a tumor lesion present heterogenous sensitivity or resistance to drugs. Moreover, resistant tumor cells interact with themselves or the surrounding constituents to form an ecosystem for drug resistance.

Many glioma studies have utilized disparate histologic and genomic platforms to characterize the stunning genomic, transcriptomic, and immunologic heterogeneity found in gliomas. Single-cell and spatial omics technologies enable unprecedented characterization of heterogeneity in solid malignancies and provide a granular annotation of transcriptional, epigenetic, and microenvironmental states with limited resected tissue. Heterogeneity in gliomas may be defined, at the broadest levels, by tumors ostensibly driven by epigenetic alterations (IDH- and histone-mutant) versus non-epigenetic tumors (IDH-wild type). Epigenetically driven tumors are defined by remarkable transcriptional programs, immunologically distinct microenvironments, and incompletely understood topography (unique cellular neighborhoods and cell-cell interactions). Thus, these tumors are the ideal substrate for single-cell multiomic technologies to disentangle the complex intra-tumoral features, including differentiation trajectories, tumor-immune cell interactions, and chromatin dysregulation. The current review summarizes the applications of single-cell multiomics to existing datasets of epigenetically driven glioma.

Yet, mediation analysis is not used as much as it should be. One reason is because of the lack of carefully planned routines, compilers, and automated computing systems for microbiome mediation analysis (MiMed) to perform a series of data processing, diversity calculation, data normalization, downstream data analysis, and visualizations. Many researchers in various disciplines (e.g. clinicians, public health practitioners, and biologists) are not also familiar with related statistical methods and programming languages on command-line interfaces. Thus, in this article, we introduce a web cloud computing platform, named as MiMed, that enables comprehensive MiMed on user-friendly web interfaces. The main features of MiMed are as follows. First, MiMed can survey the microbiome in various spheres (i) as a whole microbial ecosystem using different ecological measures (e.g. alpha- and beta-diversity indices) or (ii) as individual microbial taxa (e.g. phyla, classes, orders, families, genera, and species) using different data normalization methods. Second, MiMed enables covariate-adjusted analysis to control for potential confounding factors (e.g. age and gender), which is essential to enhance the causality of the results, especially for observational studies. Third, MiMed enables a breadth of statistical inferences in both mediation effect estimation and significance testing. Fourth, MiMed provides flexible and easy-to-use data processing and analytic modules and creates nice graphical representations. Finally, MiMed employs ChatGPT to search for what has been known about the microbial taxa that are found significantly as mediators using artificial intelligence technologies. For demonstration purposes, we applied MiMed to the study on the mediating roles of oral microbiome in subgingival niches between e-cigarette smoking and gingival inflammation.

This study aimed to construct a risk subtype typing model for SKCM.The study proposes a deep learning framework combining early fusion feature autoencoder (AE) and late fusion feature AE for risk subtype prediction of SKCM. The deep learning framework integrates mRNA, miRNA, and DNA methylation data of SKCM patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and clusters the screened multi-omics features associated with survival prognosis to identify risk subtypes. Differential expression analysis and functional enrichment analysis were performed between risk subtypes, while SVM classifiers were constructed between differentially expressed genes (DEGs) obtained by Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) logistic regression screening and risk subtype labels inferred from multi-omics data, and the predictive robustness of risk subtypes inferred from the risk subtype classification prediction model was validated using two independent datasets.The deep learning framework that combined early fusion feature AE with late fusion feature AE distinguished the two best risk subtypes compared to the multi-omics integration approach with single strategy AE or PCA. A promising C-index (C-index = 0.748) and a significant difference in survival (log-rank P value = 4.61 × 10-9) were found between the identified risk subtypes. The DEGs with the top significance values together with differentially expressed miRNAs provided the biological interpretation of risk subtypes on SKCM. Finally, the framework was applied to predict risk subtypes in two independent test datasets of SKCM patients, all of which showed good predictive power (C-index > 0.680) and significant survival differences (log-rank P value < 0.01).The SKCM risk subtypes identified by integrating multi-omics data based on deep learning can not only improve the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of SKCM, but also provide clinicians with assistance in treatment decisions.© 2023.

However, its role in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) remains unclear. Our study investigated the expression of NOP2 in HGSOC tissues and normal fimbria tissues, and found that NOP2 was significantly upregulated in HGSOC tissues. Our experiments showed that NOP2 overexpression promoted cell proliferationin vivoandin vitroand increased the migration and invasion ability of HGSOC cellsin vitro. Furthermore, we identified Rap guanine nucleotide exchange factor 4 (RAPGEF4) as a potential downstream target of NOP2 in HGSOC. Finally, our findings suggest that the regulation of NOP2 and RAPGEF4 may depend on m5C methylation levels."

In this study, we profile the change of 3D chromatin structure in glioblastoma ferroptosis by using HiChIP and study the 3D gene regulation network in glioblastoma ferroptosis. A combination of an analysis of HiChIP and RNA-seq data suggests that change of chromatin loops mediated by 3D chromatin structure regulates gene expressions in glioblastoma ferroptosis. Genes that are regulated by 3D chromatin structures include genes that were reported to function in ferroptosis, likeHDM2andTXNRD1. We propose a new regulatory mechanism governing glioblastoma cell ferroptosis by 3D chromatin structure."
"1084",37781072,"Expression And Prognostic Role of PRDX1 In Gastrointestinal Cancers.","J Cancer","Esophageal, gastric, liver, and colorectal cancers represent four prevalent gastrointestinal cancers that pose substantial threats to global health due to their high morbidity and mortality rates. Peroxiredoxin 1 (PRDX1), a significant component of the PRDXs family, primarily functions to counteract the peroxides produced by metabolic activities in the body, thereby maintaining the dynamic equilibrium of peroxidesin vivo. Intriguingly, PRDX1 expression correlates strongly with cancer's onset, progression, and prognosis. This study mainly applied bioinformatics methods to analyze PRDX1's expression, diagnosis, and prognosis in gastrointestinal cancers and to summarize current research advancements. Evidence from the bioinformatics database suggested that the high expression of PRDX1 was a prominent characteristic of these four gastrointestinal cancers, with this observation reaching statistical significance. The high expression of PRDX1 in gastrointestinal cancer cells also confirms this result. Notably, the primary alteration in PRDX1 within these cancers is the presence of genetic mutations. PRDX1 demonstrated the highest diagnostic efficacy for colorectal cancer. Nevertheless, elevated PRDX1 levels only significantly diminished the survival time of liver cancer patients, exerting no statistically significant impact on the survival duration of patients afflicted by the other three types of gastrointestinal cancers. Recent research has indicated variability in PRDX1 expression across different cancer types, with high expression being predominantly observed in these four gastrointestinal cancers and, in most instances, unfavorable prognosis. These findings broadly align with the results derived from bioinformatics. This research underscores the high expression of PRDX1 in gastrointestinal cancers, its relevance to the diagnosis and prognosis monitoring of these cancers, and its potential to guide clinical treatment for these cancers.© The author(s)."

Necroptosis was found to be crucial in reproductive and endocrine disorders, but its function in PCOS remains unclear. We aimed to identify differentially diagnostic genes for necroptosis (NDDGs), construct a diagnostic model to assess the progression of PCOS and explore the potential therapeutic drugs.Gene expression datasets were combined with weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and necroptosis gene sets to screen the differentially expressed genes for PCOS. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis was used to construct a necroptosis-related gene signatures. Independent risk analyses were performed using nomograms. Pathway enrichment of NDDGs was conducted with the GeneMANIA database and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Immune microenvironment analysis was estimated based on ssGSEA algorithm analysis. The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) was used to explore potential therapeutic drugs for NDDGs. The expression of NDDGs was validated in GSE84958, mouse model and clinical samples.Four necroptosis-related signature genes, IL33, TNFSF10, BCL2 and PYGM, were identified to define necroptosis for PCOS. The areas under curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) for training set and validation in diagnostic risk model were 0.940 and 0.788, respectively. Enrichment analysis showed that NDDGs were enriched in immune-related signaling pathways such as B cells, T cells, and natural killer cells. Immune microenvironment analysis revealed that NDDGs were significantly correlated with 13 markedly different immune cells. A nomogram was constructed based on features that would benefit patients clinically. Several compounds, such as resveratrol, tretinoin, quercetin, curcumin, etc., were mined as therapeutic drugs for PCOS. The expression of the NDDGs in the validated set, animal model and clinical samples was consistent with the results of the training sets.In this study, 4 NDDGs were identified to be highly effective in assessing the progression and prognosis of PCOS and exploring potential targets for PCOS treatment.Copyright © 2023 Wang, An, Huang, Mprah and Ding."
"1086",37726418,"Biomarkers for immunotherapy of hepatocellular carcinoma.","Nat Rev Clin Oncol","Immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are now widely used for the treatment of patients with advanced-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Two different ICI-containing regimens, atezolizumab plus bevacizumab and tremelimumab plus durvalumab, are now approved standard-of-care first-line therapies in this setting. However, and despite substantial improvements in survival outcomes relative to sorafenib, most patients with advanced-stage HCC do not derive durable benefit from these regimens. Advances in genome sequencing including the use of single-cell RNA sequencing (both of tumour material and blood samples), as well as immune cell identification strategies and other techniques such as radiomics and analysis of the microbiota, have created considerable potential for the identification of novel predictive biomarkers enabling the accurate selection of patients who are most likely to derive benefit from ICIs. In this Review, we summarize data on the immunology of HCC and the outcomes in patients receiving ICIs for the treatment of this disease. We then provide an overview of current biomarker use and developments in the past 5 years, including gene signatures, circulating tumour cells, high-dimensional flow cytometry, single-cell RNA sequencing as well as approaches involving the microbiome, radiomics and clinical markers. Novel concepts for further biomarker development in HCC are then discussed including biomarker-driven trials, spatial transcriptomics and integrated 'big data' analysis approaches. These concepts all have the potential to better identify patients who are most likely to benefit from ICIs and to promote the development of new treatment approaches.© 2023.

Its early symptoms are often vague, making non-invasive diagnosis using urinary biomarkers a promising approach.The gene expression data from urine samples of patients with HGBC was extracted from the GSE68020 dataset. The clinical information and gene expression data in tumor tissues of HGBC patients were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Multivariate Cox analysis was used to predict the optimal risk model. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis was performed via the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) database and visualized using Cytoscape. Overall survival (OS) was evaluated in the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) online platform. Competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network was also visualized using Cytoscape. The expression levels of specific genes were assessed through quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Moreover, co-expressed genes and potential biological functions related to specific genes were explored based on the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) database.A total of 560 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified when comparing the urine sediment samples from HGBC patients with the benign ones. Using these urinary DEGs and the clinical information of HGBC patients, we developed an optimal risk model consisting of eight genes to predict the patient outcome. By integrating the node degree values in the PPI network with the expression changes in both urine and tissue samples, eighteen hub genes were selected out. Among them, DKC1 and SNRPG had the most prominent comprehensive values, andEFTUD2, LORandEBNA1BP2were relevant to a worse OS in bladder cancer patients. The ceRNA network of hub genes indicated thatDKC1may be directly regulated by miR-150 in HGBC. The upregulation of bothSNRPGandDKC1were detected in HGBC cells, which were also observed in various tumor tissues and malignant cell lines, displaying high correlations with other hub genes.Our study may provide theoretical basis for the development of effective non-invasive detection and treatment strategies, and further research is necessary to explore the clinical applications of these findings.2023 Translational Cancer Research.

Specific pregnancy disorders significantly increase the risk for an ASD phenotype such as preeclampsia, preterm birth, hypoxia phenomena, and spontaneous miscarriages. They are associated with defects in the glycosylation-immune placental processes implicated in neurogenesis. Some glycans epitopes expressed in the placenta, and specifically in the extra-villous trophoblast also have predominant functions in dendritic process and synapse function. Among these, the most important are CD57 or HNK1, CD22, CD24, CD33 and CD45. They modulate the innate immune cells at the maternal-fetal interface and they promote foeto-maternal tolerance. There are many glycan-based pathways of immunosuppression. N-glycosylation pathway dysregulation has been found to be associated with autoimmune-like phenotypes and maternal-autoantibody-related (MAR) autism have been found to be associated with central, systemic and peripheric autoimmune processes. Essential molecular pathways associated with the glycan-epitopes expression have been found to be specifically dysregulated in ASD, notably the Slit/Robo, Wnt, and mTOR/RAGE signaling pathways. These modifications have important effects on major transcriptional pathways with important genetic expression consequences. These modifications lead to defects in neuronal progenitors and in the nervous system's implementation specifically, with further molecular defects in the GABA/glutamate system. Glycosylation placental processes are crucial effectors for proper maternofetal immunity and endocrine/paracrine pathways formation. Glycans/ galectins expression regulate immunity and neurulation processes with a direct link with gene expression. These need to be clearly elucidated in ASD pathophysiology."
"1091",37686296,NA,NA,"Although alcohol consumption during pregnancy is a major cause of behavioral and learning disabilities, most FASD infants are late- or even misdiagnosed due to clinician's difficulties achieving early detection of alcohol-induced neurodevelopmental impairments. Neuroplacentology has emerged as a new field of research focusing on the role of the placenta in fetal brain development. Several studies have reported that prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) dysregulates a functional placenta-cortex axis, which is involved in the control of angiogenesis and leads to neurovascular-related defects. However, these studies were focused on PlGF, a pro-angiogenic factor. The aim of the present study is to provide the first transcriptomic ""placenta-cortex"" signature of the effects of PAE on fetal angiogenesis. Whole mouse genome microarrays of paired placentas and cortices were performed to establish the transcriptomic inter-organ ""placenta-cortex"" signature in control and PAE groups at gestational day 20. Genespring comparison of the control and PAE signatures revealed that 895 and 1501 genes were only detected in one of two placenta-cortex expression profiles, respectively. Gene ontology analysis indicated that 107 of these genes were associated with vascular development, and String protein-protein interaction analysis showed that they were associated with three functional clusters. PANTHER functional classification analysis indicated that ""intercellular communication"" was a significantly enriched biological process, and 27 genes were encoded for neuroactive ligand/receptors interactors. Protein validation experiments involving Western blot for one ligand-receptor couple (Agt/AGTR1/2) confirmed the transcriptomic data, and Pearson statistical analysis of paired placentas and fetal cortices revealed a negative correlation between placental Atg and cortical AGTR1, which was significantly impacted by PAE. In humans, a comparison of a 38WG control placenta with a 36WG alcohol-exposed placenta revealed low Agt immunolabeling in the syncytiotrophoblast layer of the alcohol case. In conclusion, this study establishes the first transcriptomic placenta-cortex signature of a developing mouse. The data show that PAE markedly unbalances this inter-organ signature; in particular, several ligands and/or receptors involved in the control of angiogenesis. These data support that PAE modifies the existing communication between the two organs and opens new research avenues regarding the impact of placental dysfunction on the neurovascular development of fetuses. Such a signature would present a clinical value for early diagnosis of brain defects in FASD."

Nevertheless, no national survey on SCT among children and adolescents has been conducted in China. Hence, this research aims to study SCT in China and to evaluate the differences between SCT and ADHD symptoms by comparing their risk factors in terms of life events (LE) and parental rearing behaviors (PRB). This cross-sectional study used data from a survey on 71,929 children and adolescents in 5 province-level regions in China to study the incidence and demographic information of SCT in the Chinese population. Subsequently, the study investigated the comorbidity of ADHD and SCT, and conducted three logistic regressions on the LE and PRB scores to predict whether participants develop symptoms of ADHD or SCT, or neither symptom. 6658 participants were allocated into the SCT group, and the weighted point prevalence of SCT was 9.78%. 36.34% of participants with ADHD (n = 676) were found to demonstrate SCT symptoms, whereas no statistically significant difference was observed in its comorbidity to the three ADHD subtypes (χ2 = 1.668, p > 0.05, Δ = 2). The regression results on the presence or absence of ADHD revealed paternal excessive-interference and rejection, and maternal favoring were associated with ADHD diagnosis, whereas paternal punishment and favoring and maternal emotional warmth was related to the absence of ADHD symptoms. Academic stress and maternal excessive-interference were associated with SCT symptoms, and maternal emotional warmth associated with SCT absence. Concerning the presence of ADHD-only or SCT-only symptoms, LE adaptation was found to relate to SCT-only symptoms, while PRB paternal rejection and maternal favoring were associated with ADHD-only symptoms. While evidencing the high prevalence of SCT in China, our findings supported that although ADHD and SCT were highly comorbid, they may be considered two independent disorders with different risk factors. Specifically, participants with SCT symptoms are more vulnerable to stress from LE and tend to face more maladjustment than ADHD and normally-developing participants, and maternal rearing behaviours are the key factors to SCT symptoms. SCT brings global challenges in its diagnosis and treatment, and the challenge is more severe in a mentally stressful environment. Therefore, stress management and SCT etiology studies are recommended.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."
"1093",37781588,NA,NA,"Enhancer function is frequently investigated piecemeal using truncated reporter assays or single deletion analysis. Thus it remains unclear to what extent enhancer function at native loci relies on surrounding genomic context. Using the Big-IN technology for targeted integration of large DNAs, we analyzed the regulatory architecture of the murineIgf2/H19locus, a paradigmatic model of enhancer selectivity. We assembled payloads containing a 157-kb functionalIgf2/H19locus and engineered mutations to genetically direct CTCF occupancy at the imprinting control region (ICR) that switches the target gene of theH19enhancer cluster. Contrasting the activity of payloads delivered to the endogenous locus or to a safe harbor locus (Hprt) revealed that theIgf2/H19locus includes additional, previously unknown long-range regulatory elements. Exchanging components of theIgf2/H19locus with the well-studiedSox2locus showed that theH19enhancer cluster functioned poorly out of context, and required its native surroundings to activateSox2expression. Conversely, theSox2locus control region (LCR) could activate bothIgf2andH19outside its native context, but its activity was only partially modulated by CTCF occupancy at the ICR. Analysis of regulatory DNA actuation across different cell types revealed that, while theH19enhancers are tightly coordinated within their native locus, theSox2LCR acts more independently. We show that these enhancer clusters typify broader classes of loci genome-wide. Our results show that unexpected dependencies may influence even the most studied functional elements, and our synthetic regulatory genomics approach permits large-scale manipulation of complete loci to investigate the relationship between locus architecture and function."
"1094",37853064,"Genomic findings in schizophrenia and their implications.","Mol Psychiatry","There has been substantial progress in understanding the genetics of schizophrenia over the past 15 years. This has revealed a highly polygenic condition with the majority of the currently explained heritability coming from common alleles of small effect but with additional contributions from rare copy number and coding variants. Many specific genes and loci have been implicated that provide a firm basis upon which mechanistic research can proceed. These point to disturbances in neuronal, and particularly synaptic, functions that are not confined to a small number of brain regions and circuits. Genetic findings have also revealed the nature of schizophrenia's close relationship to other conditions, particularly bipolar disorder and childhood neurodevelopmental disorders, and provided an explanation for how common risk alleles persist in the population in the face of reduced fecundity. Current genomic approaches only potentially explain around 40% of heritability, but only a small proportion of this is attributable to robustly identified loci. The extreme polygenicity poses challenges for understanding biological mechanisms. The high degree of pleiotropy points to the need for more transdiagnostic research and the shortcomings of current diagnostic criteria as means of delineating biologically distinct strata. It also poses challenges for inferring causality in observational and experimental studies in both humans and model systems. Finally, the Eurocentric bias of genomic studies needs to be rectified to maximise benefits and ensure these are felt across diverse communities. Further advances are likely to come through the application of new and emerging technologies, such as whole-genome and long-read sequencing, to large and diverse samples. Substantive progress in biological understanding will require parallel advances in functional genomics and proteomics applied to the brain across developmental stages. For these efforts to succeed in identifying disease mechanisms and defining novel strata they will need to be combined with sufficiently granular phenotypic data.© 2023. The Author(s)."

The underlying core molecular clock regulates the expression of other genes, and it has been shown that the expression of more than 50 percent of genes in mammals displays 24-h rhythmic patterns, with the specific genes that cycle varying from one tissue to another. Determining rhythmic gene expression patterns in human tissues sampled as single timepoints has several challenges, including the reconstruction of temporal order of highly noisy data. Previous methodologies have attempted to address these challenges in one or a small number of tissues for which rhythmic gene evolutionary conservation is assumed to be preserved. Here we introduce CIRCUST, a novel CIRCular-robUST methodology for analyzing molecular rhythms, that relies on circular statistics, is robust against noise, and requires fewer assumptions than existing methodologies. Next, we validated the method against four controlled experiments in which sampling times were known, and finally, CIRCUST was applied to 34 tissues from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) dataset with the aim towards building a comprehensive daily rhythm gene expression atlas in humans. The validation and application shown here indicate that CIRCUST provides a flexible framework to formulate and solve the issues related to the analysis of molecular rhythms in human tissues.

Here, we sought to identify the transcriptional mechanisms that are necessary to maintain photoreceptor viability and function during aging. To do this, we performed a targeted photoreceptor-specific RNAi screen inDrosophilato identify transcriptional regulators whose knockdown results in premature, age-dependent retinal degeneration. From an initial set of 155 RNAi lines each targeting a unique gene and spanning a diverse set of transcription factors, chromatin remodelers, and histone modifiers, we identified 18 high-confidence target genes whose decreased expression in adult photoreceptors leads to premature and progressive retinal degeneration. These 18 target genes were enriched for factors involved in the regulation of transcription initiation, pausing, and elongation, suggesting that these processes are essential for maintaining the health of aging photoreceptors. To identify the genes regulated by these factors, we profiled the photoreceptor transcriptome in a subset of lines. Strikingly, two of the 18 target genes,Spt5anddomino, show similar changes in gene expression to those observed in photoreceptors with advanced age. Together, our data suggest that dysregulation of factors involved in transcription initiation and elongation plays a key role in shaping the transcriptome of aging photoreceptors. Further, our findings indicate that the age-dependent changes in gene expression not only correlate but might also contribute to an increased risk of retinal degeneration."

Recent evidence has shown that tubular ferroptosis contributes to the pathogenesis of CKD with persistent proinflammatory and profibrotic responses. We previously reported that natural flavonol fisetin alleviated septic acute kidney injury and protected against hyperuricemic nephropathy in mice. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effects of fisetin against fibrotic kidney disease and the underlying mechanisms. We established adenine diet-induced and unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO)-induced CKD models in adult male mice. The two types of mice were administered fisetin (50 or 100 mg·kg-1·d-1, i.g.) for 3 weeks or 7 days, respectively. At the end of the experiments, the mice were euthanized, and blood and kidneys were gathered for analyzes. We showed that fisetin administration significantly ameliorated tubular injury, inflammation, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis in the two types of CKD mice. In mouse renal tubular epithelial (TCMK-1) cells, treatment with fisetin (20 μM) significantly suppressed adenine- or TGF-β1-induced inflammatory responses and fibrogenesis, and improved cell viability. By quantitative real-time PCR analysis of ferroptosis-related genes, we demonstrated that fisetin treatment inhibited ferroptosis in the kidneys of CKD mice as well as in injured TCMK-1 cells, as evidenced by decreased ACSL4, COX2, and HMGB1, and increased GPX4. Fisetin treatment effectively restored ultrastructural abnormalities of mitochondrial morphology and restored the elevated iron, the reduced GSH and GSH/GSSG as well as the increased lipid peroxide MDA in the kidneys of CKD mice. Notably, abnormally high expression of the ferroptosis key marker ACSL4 was verified in the renal tubules of CKD patients (IgAN, MN, FSGS, LN, and DN) as well as adenine- or UUO-induced CKD mice, and in injured TCMK-1 cells. In adenine- and TGF-β1-treated TCMK-1 cells, ACSL4 knockdown inhibited tubular ferroptosis, while ACSL4 overexpression blocked the anti-ferroptotic effect of fisetin and reversed the cytoprotective, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrotic effects of fisetin. In summary, we reveal a novel aspect of the nephroprotective effect of fisetin, i.e. inhibiting ACSL4-mediated tubular ferroptosis against fibrotic kidney diseases.© 2023.

Conversely, not all obese individuals present with metabolic disorders giving rise to the concept of ""metabolically healthy obese"". We use lipidomic-based models for BMI to calculate a metabolic BMI score (mBMI) as a measure of metabolic dysregulation associated with obesity. Using the difference between mBMI and BMI (mBMIΔ), we identify individuals with a similar BMI but differing in their metabolic health and disease risk profiles. Exercise and diet associate with mBMIΔ suggesting the ability to modify mBMI with lifestyle intervention.

"1105",37700908,"Paternal effects on fetal programming.","Anim Reprod","Paternal programming is the concept that the environmental signals from the sire's experiences leading up to mating can alter semen and ultimately affect the phenotype of resulting offspring. Potential mechanisms carrying the paternal effects to offspring can be associated with epigenetic signatures (DNA methylation, histone modification and non-coding RNAs), oxidative stress, cytokines, and the seminal microbiome. Several opportunities exist for sperm/semen to be influenced during development; these opportunities are within the testicle, the epididymis, or accessory sex glands. Epigenetic signatures of sperm can be impacted during the pre-natal and pre-pubertal periods, during sexual maturity and with advancing sire age. Sperm are susceptible to alterations as dictated by their developmental stage at the time of the perturbation, and sperm and seminal plasma likely have both dependent and independent effects on offspring. Research using rodent models has revealed that many factors including over/under nutrition, dietary fat, protein, and ingredient composition (e.g., macro- or micronutrients), stress, exercise, and exposure to drugs, alcohol, and endocrine disruptors all elicit paternal programming responses that are evident in offspring phenotype. Research using livestock species has also revealed that sire age, fertility level, plane of nutrition, and heat stress can induce alterations in the epigenetic, oxidative stress, cytokine, and microbiome profiles of sperm and/or seminal plasma. In addition, recent findings in pigs, sheep, and cattle have indicated programming effects in blastocysts post-fertilization with some continuing into post-natal life of the offspring. Our research group is focused on understanding the effects of common management scenarios of plane of nutrition and growth rates in bulls and rams on mechanisms resulting in paternal programming and subsequent offspring outcomes. Understanding the implication of paternal programming is imperative as short-term feeding and management decisions have the potential to impact productivity and profitability of our herds for generations to come."
"1106",37894472,NA,NA,"The prognosis of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) is poor, and treatment selection is challenging. A heterogeneous tumor microenvironment (TME) characterizes HGSOC and influences tumor growth, progression, and therapy response. Better characterization with multidimensional approaches for simultaneous identification and categorization of the various cell populations is needed to map the TME complexity. While mass cytometry allows the simultaneous detection of around 40 proteins, the CyTOFmerge MATLAB algorithm integrates data sets and extends the phenotyping. This pilot study explored the potential of combining two datasets for improved TME phenotyping by profiling single-cell suspensions from ten chemo-naïve HGSOC tumors by mass cytometry. A 35-marker pan-tumor dataset and a 34-marker pan-immune dataset were analyzed separately and combined with the CyTOFmerge, merging 18 shared markers. While the merged analysis confirmed heterogeneity across patients, it also identified a main tumor cell subset, additionally to the nine identified by the pan-tumor panel. Furthermore, the expression of traditional immune cell markers on tumor and stromal cells was revealed, as were marker combinations that have rarely been examined on individual cells. This study demonstrates the potential of merging mass cytometry data to generate new hypotheses on tumor biology and predictive biomarker research in HGSOC that could improve treatment effectiveness."

Blockade of the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) protein can partially reinvigorate circulating exhausted-phenotype CD8+ T cells (Tex cells) in preclinical models, however the clinical implication in anti-PD-1-based immunotherapy in NSCLC is unknown.Serum specimens were obtained before and during treatment from 145 patients with NSCLC patients who received anti-PD-1 treatment and their prognoses were followed-up. Indicators such as cell subpopulations, T cell invigoration were detected by clinical laboratory testing. Survival curves were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, Cox regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with prognoses of NSCLC patients.The expressions of Ki-67 in PD-1+/CD8+ T cells in most NSCLC patients (97 of 145 cases) increased after treatment. The responding Ki-67+/CD8+ T cell population was mainly CD45RAlo CD27hi, containing cells with high expression of CTLA-4, PD-1, and 2B4 and low expression of NKG2-D (P < 0.0001). The maximum fold change of Ki-67+/PD-1+/CD8+T cells in treatment cycles and the tumor burden determined by imaging may be associated with survival. Patients with higher Ki-67 expression on PD-1+CD8+ T-cells (pretreatment) had statistically significant increased progression-free survival (PFS). A Ki-67 expression to tumor burden ratio greater than 0.6 at the 1st cycle of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy was associated with improvement of PFS and overall survival (P < 0.05).Activation of circulating Tex cells before or during therapy related to tumor burden may be associated with clinical efficacy of anti-PD-1 immune therapy in NSCLC.© 2023 Wu et al."

Many of these clinical trials involve cancer immunotherapies with antibody drugs that block the inhibitory immune checkpoints programmed death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1. While these new treatments are expected to improve the treatment outcome of NSCLC patients after pulmonary resection, several major clinical questions remain, including the appropriate timing of immunotherapy (neoadjuvant, adjuvant, or both) and the identification of patients who should be treated with neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant immunotherapies, because some early-stage NSCLC patients are cured by surgical resection alone. In addition, immunotherapy may induce immune-related adverse events that will require permanent treatment in some patients. Based on this fact as well, it is desirable to select appropriate patients for neoadjuvant/adjuvant immunotherapies. So far, data from several important trials have been published, with findings demonstrating the efficacy of adjuvant atezolizumab (IMpower010 trial), neoadjuvant nivolumab plus platinum-doublet chemotherapy (CheckMate816 trial), and several perioperative (neoadjuvant plus adjuvant) immunotherapies (AEGEAN, KEYNOTE-671, NADIM II, and Neotorch trials). In addition to these key trials, numerous clinical trials have reported a wealth of data, although most of the above clinical questions have not been completely answered yet. Because there are so many ongoing clinical trials in this field, a comprehensive understanding of the results and/or contents of these trials is necessary to explore answers to the clinical questions above as well as to plan a new clinical trial. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the recent data obtained from clinical trials addressing such questions."

The underlying molecular mechanisms for those differences are still obscure. Here, we used gene expression analysis to understand the molecular underpinning between non-frail and frail individuals in old age. Twenty-four adults (50% non-frail and 50% frail) from InCHIANTI study were included. Total RNA extracted from whole blood was analyzed by Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE). CAGE identified transcription start site (TSS) and active enhancer regions. We identified a set of differentially expressed (DE) TSS and enhancer between non-frail and frail and male and female participants. Several DE TSSs were annotated as lncRNA (XIST and TTTY14) and antisense RNAs (ZFX-AS1 and OVCH1 Antisense RNA 1). The promoter region chr6:366,786,54-366,787,97;+ was DE and overlapping the longevity CDKN1A gene. GWAS-LD enrichment analysis identifies overlapping LD-blocks with the DE regions with reported traits in GWAS catalog (isovolumetric relaxation time and urinary tract infection frequency). Furthermore, we used weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify changes of gene expression associated with clinical traits and identify key gene modules. We performed functional enrichment analysis of the gene modules with significant trait/module correlation. One gene module is showing a very distinct pattern in hub genes. Glycogen Phosphorylase L (PYGL) was the top ranked hub gene between non-frail and frail. We predicted transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) and motif activity. TF involved in age-related pathways (e.g., FOXO3 and MYC) shows different expression patterns between non-frail and frail participants. Expanding the study of OVCH1 Antisense RNA 1 and PYGL may help understand the mechanisms leading to loss of homeostasis that ultimately causes frailty.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"1111",37701757,"Aging, adaptation and maladaptation.","Front Aging","Aging is accompanied by a dysregulation of adaptive processes. On the one hand, physiological adaptation mechanisms such as learning and memory, immune system plasticity and exercise-dependent muscle remodeling are blunted. On the other hand, several maladaptive processes increase with age including cancer, pathological cardiovascular remodeling and metabolic dysregulation. With increasing age the quotient of beneficial adaptation (Ab) to harmful adaptation (Ah), Ab/Ah, decreases. The adaptation-maladaptation framework of aging entails that there are age-related pathological phenotypes that are the result of activation of physiological adaptation mechanisms (e.g., maladaptation as a result of misdirection of adaptive cascades and molecular damage incurred by adaptation processes) and their occurrence over time might, to some degree, be inevitable. Aging might hence result from the organism's inability to solve the adaptation-maladaptation dilemma. The present work explores the concept of counteracting aging through adaptation and proposes that interventions such as exercise, environmental enrichment and dietary restriction work in counteracting aging because they increase the ratio Ab/Ah by both raising Ab (e.g., by inducing metaplasticity in cells, meaning they raise the adaptability of cells to future stimuli) and decreasing Ah (e.g., through desensitizing certain potentially harmful adaptive mechanisms). Molecules whose aging-related expression changes can explain aspects of dysfunctional adaptation such as CREB and certain immediate early genes are examined and it is delineated how a better understanding of the dynamical organization of adaptation cascades could elucidate the seemingly complex role of adaptation in driving aging as well as protecting against it.Copyright © 2023 Lissek."

However, current approaches often face limitations in efficiency, specificity, and scalability, necessitating the exploration of novel strategies for identifying and validating disease-relevant targets. Advances in natural language processing have provided new avenues for predicting potential therapeutic targets for various diseases. Here, we present a novel approach for predicting therapeutic targets using a large language model (LLM). We trained a domain-specific BioGPT model on a large corpus of biomedical literature consisting of grant text and developed a pipeline for generating target prediction. Our study demonstrates that pre-training of the LLM model with task-specific texts improves its performance. Applying the developed pipeline, we retrieved prospective aging and age-related disease targets and showed that these proteins are in correspondence with the database data. Moreover, we propose CCR5 and PTH as potential novel dual-purpose anti-aging and disease targets which were not previously identified as age-related but were highly ranked in our approach. Overall, our work highlights the high potential of transformer models in novel target prediction and provides a roadmap for future integration of AI approaches for addressing the intricate challenges presented in the biomedical field."

Aging manifests in a tissue- and organ-specific manner, and is characterized by varying rates and direct and indirect interactions among different tissues and organs. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death globally, with older adults (aged >70 years) accounting for approximately two-thirds of CVD-related deaths. The prevalence of CVD increases exponentially with an individual's age. Aging is a critical independent risk factor for the development of CVD. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation exerts cardioprotective effects in the heart and restores cellular metabolic functions by modulating gene expression and regulating protein levels through its interaction with multiple target proteins. Additionally, AMPK enhances mitochondrial function and cellular energy status by facilitating the utilization of energy substrates.

Thus the composite trait of hematuria and albuminuria was chosen to enrich for glomerular pathologies. Cases had both hematuria defined by ICD codes and albuminuria defined as uACR > 3 mg/mmol. Controls had neither an ICD code for hematuria nor an uACR > 3 mg/mmol. 2429 cases and 343,509 controls from the UK Biobank were included. eGFR was lower in cases compared to controls, with the exception of the comparison in females using CKD-EPI after age adjustment. Variants at 4 loci met genome-wide significance with the following nearest genes: COL4A4, TRIM27, ETV1 and CUBN. TRIM27 is part of the extended MHC locus. All loci with the exception of ETV1 were replicated in the Geisinger MyCode cohort. The previous GWAS of hematuria reported COL4A3-COL4A4 variants and HLA-B*0801 within MHC, which is in linkage disequilibrium with the TRIM27 variant (D' = 0.59).

Additionally, it remains unknown if these risk loci are associated with response to therapy. Thus, we investigated the association between SSNS risk loci and therapy response in a large, multi-race cohort of children along the entire spectrum of childhood-onset NS.We enrolled 1,000 patients with childhood-onset NS comprised of SSNS and SRNS. Genotyping was done using TaqMan and Direct Sanger Sequencing for 9 previously reported childhood SSNS risk loci. We compared the allele frequencies (AF) and variant burden between NS vs. controls and SRNS vs. SSNS.All 9 risk loci were associated with NS compared with healthy controls (p = 3.5 × 10-3-<2.2 × 10-16). Variant burden greater than 7 was associated with risk of SRNS (OR 7.4, 95% CI 4.6-12.0,p = 8.2 × 10-16).Our study showed that genetic risk loci for childhood SSNS are associated with pattern of therapy response, may help predict disease outcome, and set the stage for individualized treatment of NS.© 2023 Cason, Chambers, Tu, Chryst-Stangl, Huggins, Lane, Ochoa, Jackson and Gbadegesin."

The key observation in support of this contention is that racial and ethnic groups exhibit pronounced differences in the frequencies of numerous pharmacogenomic variants, with direct implications for clinical practice. The use of race and ethnicity to stratify pharmacogenomic risk provides a means to avoid potential harm caused by biases introduced when treatment regimens do not consider genetic differences between population groups, particularly when majority group genetic profiles are assumed to hold for minority groups.

These regions harbour nearly 2000 potential novel genes with unknown function. In order to uncover candidate genes associated with human neurological pathologies, a comparative transcriptome study using the T2T-CHM13 and the GRCh38 genome assemblies was conducted on previously published datasets for eight distinct human neurological disorders.The analysis of differential expression in RNA sequencing data led to the identification of 336 novel candidate genes linked to human neurological disorders. Additionally, it was revealed that, on average, 3.6% of the differentially expressed genes detected with the GRCh38 assembly may represent potential false positives. Among the noteworthy findings, two novel genes were discovered, one encoding a pore-structured protein and the other a highly ordered β-strand-rich protein. These genes exhibited upregulation in multiple epilepsy datasets and hold promise as candidate genes potentially modulating the progression of the disease. Furthermore, an analysis of RNA derived from white matter lesions in multiple sclerosis patients indicated significant upregulation of 26 rRNA encoding genes. Additionally, putative pathology related genes were identified for Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, glioblastoma, glioma, and conditions resulting from the m.3242 A > G mtDNA mutation.The results presented here underline the potential of the T2T-CHM13 assembly in facilitating the discovery of candidate genes from transcriptome data in the context of human disorders.

In this study, we benchmarked six MEI detection tools (ERVcaller, MELT, Mobster, SCRAMble, TEMP2 and xTea) on ES data and on GS data from publicly available genomic samples (HG002, NA12878). For all the tools we evaluated sensitivity and precision of different filtering strategies. Results show that there were substantial differences in tool performance between ES and GS data. MELT performed best with ES data and its combination with SCRAMble increased substantially the detection rate of MEIs. By applying both tools to 10,890 ES samples from Solve-RD and 52,624 samples from Radboudumc we were able to diagnose 10 patients who had remained undiagnosed by conventional ES analysis until now.

Here, we present PanKmer, a toolkit designed for reference-free analysis of pangenome datasets consisting of dozens to thousands of individual genomes. PanKmer decomposes a set of input genomes into a table of observed k-mers and their presence-absence values in each genome. These are stored in an efficient k-mer index data format that encodes SNPs, INDELs, and SVs. It also includes functions for downstream analysis of the k-mer index, such as calculating sequence similarity statistics between individuals at whole-genome or local scales. For example, k-mers can be ""anchored"" in any individual genome to quantify sequence variability or conservation at a specific locus. This facilitates workflows with various biological applications, e.g. identifying cases of hybridization between plant species.

In this work, we investigated the association of satDNAs with chromosome-shuffling events, as well as their potential relevance in both sex and karyotype evolution, using the well-knownPyrrhulinafish model.Pyrrhulinaspecies have a conserved karyotype dominated by acrocentric chromosomes present in all examined species up to date. However, two species, namelyP. marilynaeandP. semifasciata,stand out for exhibiting unique traits that distinguish them from others in this group. The first shows a reduced diploid number (with 2n= 32), while the latter has a well-differentiated multiple X1X2Y sex chromosome system. In addition to isolating and characterizing the full collection of satDNAs (satellitomes) of both species, we also in situ mapped these sequences in the chromosomes of both species. Moreover, the satDNAs that displayed signals on the sex chromosomes ofP. semifasciatawere also mapped in some phylogenetically related species to estimate their potential accumulation on proto-sex chromosomes. Thus, a large collection of satDNAs for both species, with several classes being shared between them, was characterized for the first time. In addition, the possible involvement of these satellites in the karyotype evolution ofP. marilynaeandP. semifasciata, especially sex-chromosome formation and karyotype reduction inP. marilynae,could be shown."

No clinical study has explored the role of inflammation and oxidative stress in the relationship between LTL and kidney dysfunction. Therefore, we examined the relationship between baseline LTL and albuminuria progression and/or rapid renal function decline in Chinese patients with or without hypertension and investigated whether inflammation and oxidative stress played a mediating role in this relationship.Methods:We conducted a prospective study including 262 patients in a 7-year follow-up period from 2014 to 2021. Data on LTL, inflammation, oxidative markers, renal function, and urine protein levels were assessed. Kidney dysfunction was defined as either albuminuria progression, rapid decline in renal function, or the composite endpoint (albuminuria progression and rapid decline in renal function). Logistic regression and simple mediation models were used for the analysis.Results:In this cohort (mean age, 54.3±9.7 years; follow-up period, 5.9±1.1 years), 42(16.0%), 21(8.0%), and 59(22.5%) patients developed albuminuria progression, rapid eGFR decline, and the composite endpoint of kidney dysfunction, respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed that each standard deviation decrease of baseline LTL and the lower quartile (Q) of baseline LTL were significantly correlated with an increased risk of rapid decline in renal function (OR=1.83 [95% CI 1.07, 3.27] per 1SD,P=0.03; OR=7.57 [95% CI 1.25, 145.88] for Q1 vs. Q4,Pfor trend=0.031); and the composite endpoint of kidney dysfunction (OR=1.37 [95% CI 0.97, 1.96] per 1SD, borderline positiveP=0.072; OR=2.96[95% CI 1.15, 8.2] for Q1 vs. Q4,Pfor trend=0.036). The mediating analysis showed that tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a partly mediated the relationship between LTL and rapid decline in renal function (direct effect: β=0.046 95%CI [0.006, 0.090],P=0.02; indirect effect: β=0.013 95%CI [0.003, 0.020]), and the mediating proportion was 22.4%.In subgroup analyses, LTL was inversely associated with rapid decline in renal function or the composite endpoint of kidney dysfunction only in patients with hypertension (OR=49.07[3.72,211.12]vs.1.32[0.69,2.58] per 1SD,Pfor interaction=0.045;OR=3.10 [1.48, 7.52]vs.1.08[0.92,1.63] per 1SD,Pfor interaction=0.036).Conclusion:Baseline LTL could independently predict kidney dysfunction at follow-up, especially in participants with hypertension. TNF-a partially mediated the negative association between LTL and kidney dysfunction.© The author(s)."

This risk was manifest during the COVID-19 pandemic, when elderly people were disproportionately affected and died from SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. However, the recent pandemic also provided lessons on lung resilience. An overwhelming majority of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, even those with severe disease, recovered with near-complete restoration of lung architecture and function. These observations are inconsistent with historic views of the lung as a terminally differentiated organ incapable of regeneration.

Additionally, when an atlas is available, reducing control sample numbers does not increase false discovery rates. Jointly analyzing data from a COVID-19 cohort and a blood cell atlas, we improve detection of infection-related cell states linked to distinct clinical severities.

"1133",37759430,"The Dual Role of the Airway Epithelium in Asthma: Active Barrier and Regulator of Inflammation.","Cells","Chronic airway inflammation is the cornerstone on which bronchial asthma arises, and in turn, chronic inflammation arises from a complex interplay between environmental factors such as allergens and pathogens and immune cells as well as structural cells constituting the airway mucosa. Airway epithelial cells (AECs) are at the center of these processes. On the one hand, they represent the borderline separating the body from its environment in order to keep inner homeostasis. The airway epithelium forms a multi-tiered, self-cleaning barrier that involves an unstirred, discontinuous mucous layer, the dense and rigid mesh of the glycocalyx, and the cellular layer itself, consisting of multiple, densely interconnected cell types. On the other hand, the airway epithelium represents an immunologically highly active tissue once its barrier has been penetrated: AECs play a pivotal role in releasing protective immunoglobulin A. They express a broad spectrum of pattern recognition receptors, enabling them to react to environmental stressors that overcome the mucosal barrier. By releasing alarmins-proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines-AECs play an active role in the formation, strategic orientation, and control of the subsequent defense reaction. Consequently, the airway epithelium is of vital importance to chronic inflammatory diseases, such as asthma."

Rabbits were then ventilated with driving pressure of 10, 15, 20, or 25 cmH2O for 7 h. Clinicopathological parameters were measured at baseline and different timepoints of ventilation. RNA sequencing was conducted to identify the differentially expressed genes in high driving pressure ventilated lung tissue.The two-hit injury induced ALI in rabbits was evidenced by dramatically decreased PaO2/FiO2in the ALI group compared with that in the control group (144.5 ± 23.8 mmHg vs. 391.6 ± 26.6 mmHg, P < 0.001). High driving pressure ventilation (20 and 25 cmH2O) significantly elevated the parameters of acute pulmonary hypertension at different timepoints compared with low driving pressure (10 and 15 cmH2O), along with significant increases in lung wet/dry ratios, total protein contents in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and lung injury scores. The high driving pressure groups showed more pronounced histopathological abnormalities in the lung compared with the low driving pressure groups, accompanied by significant increases in the cross-sectional areas of myocytes, right ventricular weight/body weight value, and Fulton's index. Furthermore, the expression of the genes related to ferroptosis induction was generally upregulated in high driving pressure groups compared with those in low driving pressure groups.A rabbit model of ventilation-induced pulmonary hypertension in ALI was successfully established.

The recently unravelled multi-organ heterogeneity of macrophages in healthy and fibrotic human disease suggests that macrophages expressing osteopontin (SPP1) associate with lung and liver fibrosis. However, the conservation of this SPP1+macrophage population across different tissues and its specificity to fibrotic diseases with different etiologies remain unclear. Integrating 15 single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets to profile 235,930 tissue macrophages from healthy and fibrotic heart, lung, liver, kidney, skin, and endometrium, we extended the association of SPP1+macrophages with fibrosis to all these tissues. We also identified a subpopulation expressing matrisome-associated genes (e.g., matrix metalloproteinases and their tissue inhibitors), functionally enriched for ECM remodelling and cell metabolism, representative of a matrisome-associated macrophage (MAM) polarisation state within SPP1+macrophages. Importantly, the MAM polarisation state follows a differentiation trajectory from SPP1+macrophages and is associated with a core set of regulon activity. SPP1+macrophages without the MAM polarisation state (SPP1+MAM-) show a positive association with ageing lung in mice and humans. These results suggest an advanced and conserved polarisation state of SPP1+macrophages in fibrotic tissues resulting from prolonged inflammatory cues within each tissue microenvironment.© 2023, Ouyang, Mishra et al."

A systemic single-cell type-based study provides a unique opportunity to understand the mechanisms behind age-related pathologies. Here, we use single-cell gene expression analysis comparing healthy young and aged human lungs from nonsmoker donors to investigate age-related transcriptional changes. Our data suggest that aging has a heterogenous effect on lung cells, as some populations are more transcriptionally dynamic while others remain stable in aged individuals. We found that monocytes and alveolar macrophages were the most transcriptionally affected populations. These changes were related to inflammation and regulation of the immune response. Additionally, we calculated the LungAge score, which reveals the diversity of lung cell types during aging. Changes in DNA damage repair, fatty acid metabolism, and inflammation are essential for age prediction. Finally, we quantified the senescence score in aged lungs and found that the more biased cells toward senescence are immune and progenitor cells. Our study provides a comprehensive and systemic analysis of the molecular signatures of lung aging.

For better understanding the mechanisms of brain regeneration, it is very necessary to establish a rapid and efficient gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches to study gene function in the axolotl brain. Here, we establish and optimize an electroporation-based method to overexpress or knockout/knockdown target gene in ependymal glial cells (EGCs) in the axolotl telencephalon. By orientating the electrodes, we were able to achieve specific expression of EGFP in EGCs located in dorsal, ventral, medial, or lateral ventricular zones. We then studied the role ofCdc42in brain regeneration by introducingCdc42into EGCs through electroporation, followed by brain injury. Our findings showed that overexpression ofCdc42in EGCs did not significantly affect EGC proliferation and production of newly born neurons, but it disrupted their apical polarity, as indicated by the loss of the ZO-1 tight junction marker. This disruption led to a ventricular accumulation of newly born neurons, which are failed to migrate into the neuronal layer where they could mature, thus resulted in a delayed brain regeneration phenotype. Furthermore, when electroporating CAS9-gRNA protein complexes againstTnC(Tenascin-C) into EGCs of the brain, we achieved an efficient knockdown ofTnC. In the electroporation-targeted area,TnCexpression is dramatically reduced at both mRNA and protein levels. Overall, this study established a rapid and efficient electroporation-based gene manipulation approach allowing for investigation of gene function in the process of axolotl brain regeneration."

The application of 2D layer materials like lamellar graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), and black phosphorus (BPs) and so on have been developed for CT/MRI imaging, serum biosensing, drug targeting delivery, photothermal therapy, and photodynamic therapy. These unique applications for tumor are due to the multi-variable synthesis of 2D materials and the structural characteristics of good ductility different from microsphere. Based on the above considerations, the application of 2D materials in cancer is mainly carried out in the following three aspects: 1) In terms of accurate and rapid screening of tumor patients, we will focus on the enrichment of serum markers and sensitive signal transformation of 2D materials; 2) The progress of 2D nanomaterials in tumor MRI and CT imaging was described by comparing the performance of traditional contrast agents; 3) In the most important aspect, we will focus on the progress of 2D materials in the field of precision drug delivery and collaborative therapy, such as photothermal ablation, sonodynamic therapy, chemokinetic therapy, etc. In summary, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the advances in the application of 2D layer materials for tumor diagnosis and treatment, and emphasizes the performance difference between 2D materials and other types of nanoparticles (mainly spherical).

These diseases present in a broad phenotypic spectrum: at the severe end is Neu-Laxova syndrome, in the intermediate range are infantile serine biosynthesis defects with severe neurological manifestations and growth deficiency, and at the mild end is childhood disease with intellectual disability. However, L-serine supplementation, especially if started early, can ameliorate and in some cases even prevent symptoms. Therefore, knowledge of pathogenic variants can improve clinical outcomes. Here, we use a yeast-based assay to individually measure the functional impact of 1,914 SNV-accessible amino acid substitutions in PSAT. Results of our assay agree well with clinical interpretations and protein structure-function relationships, supporting the inclusion of our data as functional evidence as part of the ACMG variant interpretation guidelines. We use existing ClinVar variants, disease alleles reported in the literature and variants present as homozygotes in the primAD database to define assay ranges that could aid clinical variant interpretation for up to 98% of the tested variants. In addition to measuring the functional impact of individual variants in yeast haploid cells, we also assay pairwise combinations of PSAT1 alleles that recapitulate human genotypes, including compound heterozygotes, in yeast diploids. Results from our diploid assay successfully distinguish the genotypes of affected individuals from those of healthy carriers and agree well with disease severity. Finally, we present a linear model that uses individual allele measurements to predict the biallelic function of ~1.8 million allele combinations corresponding to potential human genotypes.

However, with the encouraging results of immune checkpoint inhibitiors (ICI) directed against PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 in recent years, the treatment landscape of BC is rapidly changing. In addition, it is becoming clear that the effect of ICI is highly dependent on the interaction between tumor cells and the tumor immune micro-environment (TIME). Different immune cells are involved in an anti-tumor response in BC. Cytotoxic CD8+T-cells are the main effector cells, aided by other immune cells including other T-cells, B-cells and pro-inflammatory macrophages. As part of the ongoing anti-tumor immune response, lymphocytes aggregate in clusters called tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS). Tumor mutational burden (TMB) and infiltration of immune cells into the tumor are both important factors for establishing an anti-tumor immune response. In contrast, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) prevents infiltration of lymphocytes and potentially has an immunosuppressive effect. In conclusion, the effect of ICI seems to be reliant on a combination of tumor-intrinsic and TIME-related parameters.

Hair follicles harbour exceptional regenerative abilities as they contain multiple somatic stem cell populations such as hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) and melanocyte stem cells. Surrounding the stem cells and their progeny, diverse groups of cells and extracellular matrix proteins are organized to form a microenvironment (called 'niche') that serves to promote and maintain the optimal functioning of these stem cell populations. Recent studies have shed light on the intricate nature of the HFSC niche and its crucial role in regulating hair follicle regeneration. In this Review, we describe how the niche serves as a signalling hub, communicating, deciphering and integrating both local signals within the skin and systemic inputs from the body and environment to modulate HFSC activity.

"1151",37685992,NA,NA,"Immunological aging type definition requires establishing reference intervals from the distribution of immunosenescence biomarkers conditional on age. For 1605 individuals (18-97 years), we determined the comprehensive immune age index IMMAX from flow-cytometry-based blood cell sub-populations and identified age-specific centiles by fitting generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape. The centiles were uncorrelated with age and facilitated the categorization of individuals as immunologically slow or fast aging types. Using its 50th percentile as a reference, we rescaled the IMMAX to equivalent years of life (EYOL) and computed the immunological age gap as the difference between EYOL and chronological age. Applied to preliminary baseline and follow-up measurements from 53 participants of the Dortmund Vital Study (Clinical-Trials.gov Identifier: NCT05155397), the averaged changes in the IMMAX and EYOL conformed to the 5-year follow-up period, whereas no significant changes occurred concerning IMMAX centiles and age gap. This suggested that the participants immunologically adapted to aging and kept their relative positions within the cohort. Sex was non-significant. Methodical comparisons indicated that future confirmatory analyses with the completed follow-up examinations could rely on percentile curves estimated by simple linear quantile regression, while the selection of the immunosenescence biomarker will greatly influence the outcome, with IMMAX representing the preferable choice."

Blood samples were retrieved from 180 pregnant women using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) tubes. Serum samples were used to measure the vitamin D, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D or calcidiol), and lipid profiles. Blood was used to measure the hemoglobin A1c levels and to isolate the DNA. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed for the ApaI (rs79785232), BsmI (rs1544410), FokI (rs2228570), and TaqI (rs731236) SNPs in theVDRgene using restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Validation was performed using Sanger sequencing. Statistical analyses were performed between the patients with and without GDM using various statistical software packages.Results: The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium analysis was statistically significant (p> 0.05). The ApaI, BsmI, and TaqI SNPs were associated with alleles, genotypes, and different genetic models (p< 0.05). Vitamin D levels were associated with deficient levels (p= 0.0002), as well as with a normal and overweight body mass index (p= 0.0004). When vitamin D levels were measured with GDM covariates, the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (p= 0.0001), postprandial blood glucose (PPBG) (p< 0.0001), oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)-1 h (p= 0.005), high-density lipoprotein (p= 0.022), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc) (p= 0.001) levels were significantly different. When similar vitamin D levels were measured for each genotype, we confirmed that the ApaI SNP was associated with sufficient levels (p< 0.0001), whereas the BsmI, FokI, and TaqI (p< 0.05) were associated with insufficient levels. The logistic regression model confirmed that the first hour of the OGTT (p= 0.005) was strongly associated with GDM, whereas the analysis of variance confirmed that FPG and PPBG (p< 0.05) were strongly associated with all the SNPs evaluated in theVDRgene. Additionally, the second hour of the OGTT (p= 0.048) and LDLc (p= 0.049) were associated with the ApaI and FokI SNP. Moreover, the first hour OGTT (p= 0.045) and lipid profile parameters (p< 0.05) were associated. Haplotype analysis revealed positive associations among the examined SNPs, which seemed compatible with the hypothesis that variants and combinations of multiple SNP genotypes enhance the risk of GDM in women. Haplotype analysis revealed that different combinations of alleles, such as AGCC, CATT, CGTC, AGTC, and CATT (p< 0.05), were strongly associated. The linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis showed a strong association with all combinations (p< 0.05). Among the gene-gene interactions, all possible combinations showed a positive association (p< 0.05).Conclusions: Low vitamin D levels were observed in women with GDM. The ApaI, BsmI, and TaqI SNPs were associated with genotype and allele frequencies (p< 0.05). Vitamin D and the SNPs in theVDRgene were associated, according to the ANOVA, logistic regression, haplotype analysis, LD analysis, and the generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction model (p< 0.05)."

Although the effects of prenatal nutritional deficiency on the development of hypertension and cardiovascular diseases in adulthood have been extensively documented, its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the precise role and functional significance of epigenetic modifications in the pathogenesis of hypertension. To this end, we integrated methylome and transcriptome data to identify potential salt-sensitive hypertension genes using the kidneys of stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHRSP) pups exposed to a low-protein diet throughout their fetal life. Maternal protein restriction during gestation led to a positive correlation between DNA hypermethylation of the renal prostaglandin E receptor 1 (Ptger1) CpG island and high mRNA expression ofPtger1in offspring, which is consistently conserved. Furthermore, post-weaning low-protein or high-protein diets modified thePtger1DNA hypermethylation caused by fetal malnutrition. Here, we show that this epigenetic variation inPtger1is linked to disease susceptibility established during fetal stages and could be reprogrammed by manipulating the postnatal diet. Thus, our findings clarify the developmental origins connecting the maternal nutritional environment and potential epigenetic biomarkers for offspring hypertension. These findings shed light on hypertension prevention and prospective therapeutic strategies."

Genetic data related to peripheral blood sorting counts of leukocytes were collected from a genome-wide association study by Blood Cell Consortium (BCX). Single nucleotide polymorphic loci predicting peripheral blood sorting counts of these leukocytes were selected as instrumental variables according to the correlation assumption, independence assumption and exclusivity assumption of MR. The data on breast cancer and its subtypes were obtained from Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) and FinnGen Consortium. In this study, the Inverse-Variance Weighted (IVW), Weighted Median, MR-Egger, Maximum Likelihood (ML), MR-PRESSO and Constrained Maximum Likelihood and Model Averaging (cML-MA) methods of random effects models were used for MR analysis. Cochran's Q analysis, and MR-Egger intercept analysis were applied for sensitivity analysis. IVW and cML-MA were considered the primary analytical tools, and the results of the other 4 MRs were used as complementary and validation. The results suggest that there is no significant causal relationship between leukocyte count and breast cancer risk (IVW OR = 0.98 [95% CI: 0.93-1.03], p-value = 0.35; CML-MA OR = 1.01 [95% CI: 0.98-1.05], p-value = 0.51). In addition, we analyzed whether there was a potential correlation between the five main types of categorized leukocyte counts and different breast cancer subtypes. We did not find significant evidence to support a significant correlation between leukocyte counts and breast cancer subtypes.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."
"1156",37794016,NA,NA,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common inflammatory skin condition and prior genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 71 associated loci. In the current study we conducted the largest AD GWAS to date (discovery N = 1,086,394, replication N = 3,604,027), combining previously reported cohorts with additional available data. We identified 81 loci (29 novel) in the European-only analysis (which all replicated in a separate European analysis) and 10 additional loci in the multi-ancestry analysis (3 novel). Eight variants from the multi-ancestry analysis replicated in at least one of the populations tested (European, Latino or African), while two may be specific to individuals of Japanese ancestry. AD loci showed enrichment for DNAse I hypersensitivity and eQTL associations in blood. At each locus we prioritised candidate genes by integrating multi-omic data. The implicated genes are predominantly in immune pathways of relevance to atopic inflammation and some offer drug repurposing opportunities.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."

Moreover, they populate a wide range of mucosal tissues and are intimately connected to immune and neuronal cells, either directly or through the release of pharmacologically active mediators. They are now recognised to fulfil both homeostatic roles, in metabolism and tissue integrity, as well as acting as the first sensors of parasite infection, immunity to which is lost in their absence. In this review we focus primarily on the importance of tuft cells in the intestinal niche, but also link to their more generalised physiological role and discuss their potential as targets for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders."

Prognostic testing requires accessibility to tumor tissue, which is usually not available with eye-preserving therapies. Noninvasive approaches to prognostic testing that provide valuable information for patient care are therefore needed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of circulating cell-free plasma DNA analysis in UM patients undergoing brachytherapy.The study recruited 26 uveal melanoma patients referred to the department between February and October 2020. Blood samples were collected at various time points before, during, and after treatment, and deep amplicon sequencing was used to identify oncogenic variant alleles of the GNAQ and GNA11 genes, which serve as indicators for the presence of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA).The results showed that all patients were ctDNA negative before brachytherapy. In 31% of patients, ctDNA was detected during therapy. The variant allele fraction of GNAQ or GNA11 alleles in ctDNA positive samples ranged from 0.24% to 2% and correlates with the largest basal diameter and thickness of the tumor.The findings suggest that brachytherapy increases the presence of tumor DNA in the plasma of UM patients. Thus ctDNA analysis may offer a noninvasive approach for prognostic testing. However, efforts are still required to lower the limit of detection for tumor-specific genetic alterations."

The World Health Organization (WHO) proclaims a decrease in the prevalence of daily smoking in both males and females from 1980 to 2012, however, the number of regular smokers since then has exponentially increased. The low socio-income status individuals contribute greatly towards tobacco-attributable diseases due to limited access to healthcare systems, mostly in developing countries as compared to developed countries. Smoking affects the optimal functioning of the human body, which results in altered body system processes. Although a high intake of nicotine can lead to prolonged adherence and dependence on smoking, other factors, such as an individual's level of health-related quality of life (HRQOL), stress, depression, and anxiety, can produce similar effects. Smoking has a wide impact on lifestyle factors, which explains the increase in the number of sedentary smokers with decreased health fitness levels and poor lifestyle conditions. Therefore, this study seeks to investigate the exercise effects on health-related quality of life (HRQOL), muscular function, cardiorespiratory function, and body composition in smokers. Concurrently, exercise as an intervention has been sourced as a rehabilitation strategy during smoking cessation programmes to restore the diminishing health components, however, a high rate of relapse occurs due to intolerable withdrawal symptoms."
"1161",37747686,"Current Understanding of Complement Proteins as Therapeutic Targets for the Treatment of Immunoglobulin A Nephropathy.","Drugs","Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common primary glomerulonephritis worldwide and a frequent cause of kidney failure. Currently, the diagnosis necessitates a kidney biopsy, with routine immunofluorescence microscopy revealing IgA as the dominant or co-dominant immunoglobulin in the glomerular immuno-deposits, often with IgG and sometimes IgM or both. Complement protein C3 is observed in most cases. IgAN leads to kidney failure in 20-40% of patients within 20 years of diagnosis and reduces average life expectancy by about 10 years. There is increasing clinical, biochemical, and genetic evidence that the complement system plays a paramount role in the pathogenesis of IgAN. The presence of C3 in the kidney immuno-deposits differentiates the diagnosis of IgAN from subclinical glomerular mesangial IgA deposition. Markers of complement activation via the lectin and alternative pathways in kidney-biopsy specimens are associated with disease activity and are predictive of poor outcome. Levels of select complement proteins in the circulation have also been assessed in patients with IgAN and found to be of prognostic value. Ongoing genetic studies have identified at least 30 loci associated with IgAN. Genes within some of these loci encode complement-system regulating proteins that can interact with immune complexes. The growing appreciation for the central role of complement components in IgAN pathogenesis highlighted these pathways as potential treatment targets and sparked great interest in pharmacological agents targeting the complement cascade for the treatment of IgAN, as evidenced by the plethora of ongoing clinical trials.© 2023.

DNA biosensors offer significant advantages over existing bioanalytical techniques, addressing limitations in sensitivity, selectivity, and limit of detection. Consequently, they have attracted significant attention from researchers worldwide. Here, we exemplify four foundational categories of functional nucleic acids: aptamers, DNAzymes, i-motifs, and G-quadruplexes, from the perspective of the structure-driven functionality in constructing DNA biosensors. Furthermore, we provide a concise overview of the design and detection mechanisms employed in these DNA biosensors. Noteworthy advantages of DNA as a sensor component, including its programmable structure, reaction predictility, exceptional specificity, excellent sensitivity, and thermal stability, are highlighted. These characteristics contribute to the efficacy and reliability of DNA biosensors. Despite their great potential, challenges remain for the successful application of DNA biosensors, spanning storage and detection conditions, as well as associated costs. To overcome these limitations, we propose potential strategies that can be implemented to solve these issues. By offering these insights, we aim to inspire subsequent researchers in related fields."

Long reads that can span repeat regions, along with an accurate alignment of these long reads play an important role in identifying novel SVs. Long-read sequencers, such as nanopore sequencing, can address this problem by providing very long reads but with high error rates, making accurate alignment challenging. Many errors induced by nanopore sequencing have a bias because of the physics of the sequencing process and proper utilization of these error characteristics can play an important role in designing a robust aligner for SV detection problems. In this article, we design and evaluate HQAlign, an aligner for SV detection using nanopore sequenced reads. The key ideas of HQAlign include (i) using base-called nanopore reads along with the nanopore physics to improve alignments for SVs, (ii) incorporating SV-specific changes to the alignment pipeline, and (iii) adapting these into existing state-of-the-art long-read aligner pipeline, minimap2 (v2.24), for efficient alignments.We show that HQAlign captures about 4%-6% complementary SVs across different datasets, which are missed by minimap2 alignments while having a standalone performance at par with minimap2 for real nanopore reads data. For the common SV calls between HQAlign and minimap2, HQAlign improves the start and the end breakpoint accuracy by about 10%-50% for SVs across different datasets. Moreover, HQAlign improves the alignment rate to 89.35% from minimap2 85.64% for nanopore reads alignment to recent telomere-to-telomere CHM13 assembly, and it improves to 86.65% from 83.48% for nanopore reads alignment to GRCh37 human genome.https://github.com/joshidhaivat/HQAlign.git.Published by Oxford University Press 2023."
