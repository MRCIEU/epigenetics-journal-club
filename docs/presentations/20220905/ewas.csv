Nevertheless, the applications of ctDNA to the early detection and screening of cancer remain highly challenging due to the scarcity of cancer cell-specific ctDNA, the low signal-to-noise ratio of DNA variation, and the lack of non-locus-specific DNA methylation technologies.We enrolled three cohorts of breast cancer (BC) patients from two hospitals in China (BC: n = 123; healthy controls: n = 40). We developed a ctDNA whole-genome bisulfite sequencing technology employing robust trace ctDNA capture from up to 200 μL plasma, mini-input (1 ng) library preparation, unbiased genome-wide coverage and comprehensive computational methods.A diagnostic signature comprising 15 ctDNA methylation markers exhibited high accuracy in the early (area under the curve [AUC] of 0.967) and advanced (AUC of 0.971) BC stages in multicentre patient cohorts. Furthermore, we revealed a ctDNA methylation signature that discriminates estrogen receptor status (Training set: AUC of 0.984 and Test set: AUC of 0.780). Different cancer types, including hepatocellular carcinoma and lung cancer, could also be well distinguished.Our study provides a toolset to generate unbiased whole-genome ctDNA methylomes with a minimal amount of plasma to develop highly specific and sensitive biomarkers for the early diagnosis and molecular subtyping of cancer.© 2022 The Authors.

To explore the role of DNA methylation changes in PD and DLB pathogenesis, we performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of 322 postmortem frontal cortex samples and replicated results in an independent set of 200 donors. We report novel differentially methylated replicating loci associated with Braak Lewy body stage near TMCC2, SFMBT2, AKAP6 and PHYHIP. Differentially methylated probes were independent of known PD genetic risk alleles. Meta-analysis provided suggestive evidence for a differentially methylated locus within the chromosomal region affected by the PD-associated 22q11.2 deletion. Our findings elucidate novel disease pathways in PD and DLB and generate hypotheses for future molecular studies of Lewy body pathology.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Genotyping was performed using Illumina HumanOmniExpressExome-8 BeadChips and gene expression using Ion AmpliSeq Human Gene Expression Core Panel. Treatment escalation was characterised by the need for biological agents or surgery after initial disease remission.A total of 137 differentially methylated positions (DMP) were identified in IBD, including VMP1/MIR21 (p=9.11×10 -15) and RPS6KA2 (6.43×10 -13); with consistency seen across Scandinavia and UK. Dysregulated loci demonstrate strong genetic influence, notably VMP1 (p=1.53×10 -15). Age acceleration is seen in IBD (coefficient 0.94, p<2.2x10 -16). Several immuno-active genes demonstrated highly significant correlations between methylation and gene expression in IBD, in particular OSM: IBD r -0.32, p 3.64×10 -7 vs. non-IBD r -0.14, p=0.77). Multi-omic integration of methylome, genome and transcriptome also implicate specific pathways that associate with immune activation, response and regulation at disease inception. At follow up, a signature of 3 DMPs (TAP1, TESPA1, RPTOR) associated with treatment escalation to biological agents or surgery (hazard ratio of 5.19 (CI:2.14-12.56, logrank p=9.70×10 -4).These data demonstrate consistent epigenetic alterations at diagnosis in European patients with IBD, providing insights into the pathogenetic importance and translational potential of epigenetic mapping in complex disease.© The Author(s) 2022.

adults,disease,35998097,J Crohns Colitis,inflammatory bowel disease,whole blood,309 cases vs 243 controls,224 sites,Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Peripheral Blood DNA methylation studies in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Over the past decade, the DNA methylome has been increasingly studied in peripheral blood of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. However, a comprehensive summary and meta-analysis of peripheral blood leukocyte (PBL) DNA methylation studies has thus far not been conducted. Here, we systematically reviewed all available literature up to February 2022 and summarized the observations by means of meta-analysis.We conducted a systematic search and critical appraisal of IBD-associated DNA methylation studies in PBL using the biomarker-based cross-sectional studies (BIOCROSS) tool. Subsequently, we performed meta-analyses on the summary statistics obtained from epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) that included patients with Crohn's Disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and/or healthy controls (HC).Altogether, we included 15 studies for systematic review. Critical appraisal revealed large methodological and outcome heterogeneity between studies. Summary statistics were obtained from 4 studies based on a cumulative 552 samples (177 CD, 132 UC and 243 HC). Consistent differential methylation was identified for 256 differentially methylated probes (DMPs; Bonferroni-adjusted p-value ≤0.05) when comparing CD with HC and 103 when comparing UC with HC. Comparing IBD (CD + UC) with HC resulted in 224 DMPs. Importantly, several of the previously identified DMPs, such as VMP1/TMEM49/MIR21 and RPS6KA2, were consistently differentially methylated across all studies.Methodological homogenization of IBD epigenetic studies is needed to allow for easier aggregation and independent validation. Nonetheless, we were capable of confirming previous observations. Our results can serve as the basis for future IBD epigenetic biomarker research in PBL.© The Author(s) 2022.

adults,disease,35982059,Nat Commun,Alzheimers disease,whole blood,427 cases vs 857 controls,5 sites,Cross-tissue analysis of blood and brain epigenome-wide association studies in Alzheimer's disease.,"To better understand DNA methylation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) from both mechanistic and biomarker perspectives, we performed an epigenome-wide meta-analysis of blood DNA methylation in two large independent blood-based studies in AD, the ADNI and AIBL studies, and identified 5 CpGs, mapped to the SPIDR, CDH6 genes, and intergenic regions, that are significantly associated with AD diagnosis. A cross-tissue analysis that combined these blood DNA methylation datasets with four brain methylation datasets prioritized 97 CpGs and 10 genomic regions that are significantly associated with both AD neuropathology and AD diagnosis. An out-of-sample validation using the AddNeuroMed dataset showed the best performing logistic regression model includes age, sex, immune cell type proportions, and methylation risk score based on prioritized CpGs in cross-tissue analysis (AUC = 0.696, 95% CI: 0.616 - 0.770, P-value = 2.78 × 10-5). Our study offers new insights into epigenetics in AD and provides a valuable resource for future AD biomarker discovery.© 2022. The Author(s)."

We used maternal blood samples collected during the second trimester from a Singaporean longitudinal birth cohort study to examine the association between inter-individual genome-wide DNA methylation and prenatal maternal depressive symptoms. We found that (1) the maternal methylome was significantly associated with prenatal maternal depressive symptomsonlyin mothers with a female fetus; and (2) this sex-dependent association was observed in a comparable, UK-based birth cohort study. Qualitative analyses showed fetal sex-specific differences in genomic features of depression-related CpGs and genes mapped from these CpGs in mothers with female fetuses implicated in a depression-associated WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway. These same genes also showed enriched expression in brain regions linked to major depressive disorder. We also found similar female-specific associations with fetal-facing placenta methylome. Our fetal sex-specific findings provide evidence for maternal-fetal interactions as a mechanism for intergenerational transmission.© 2022 The Authors."

In the Comprehensive Assessment of Long-term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy (CALERIE TM) human trial we evaluated associations of CR and changes in whole-blood DNAm.CALERIE TM randomized 220 healthy, non-obese adults in a 2:1 allocation to two years of CR or ad libitum (AL) diet. The average CR in the treatment group through 24-months of follow-up was 12%. Whole blood (baseline, 12 and 24 month) DNAm profiles were measured. Epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) analysis tested CR-induced changes from baseline to 12- and 24-months in the n=197 participants with available DNAm data.CR treatment was not associated with epigenome-wide significant (FDR<0.05) DNAm changes at the individual-CpG-site level. Secondary analysis of sets of CpG sites identified in published EWAS revealed that CR induced DNAm changes opposite to those associated with higher body mass index and cigarette smoking (p<0.003 at 12- and 24-month follow-ups). In contrast, CR altered DNAm at chronological-age associated CpG sites in the direction of older age (p<0.003 at 12- and 24-month follow-ups).Although individual CpG site DNAm changes in response to CR were not identified, analyses of sets CpGs identified in prior EWAS revealed CR-induced changes to blood DNAm. Altered CpG sets were enriched for insulin-production, glucose-tolerance, inflammation, and DNA-binding and -regulation pathways, several of which are known to be modified by CR. DNAm changes may contribute to CR effects on aging.© The Author(s) 2022. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Gerontological Society of America."
adults,phenotype,36036794,Environ Health Perspect,activities of daily living disability,whole blood,212 cases vs controls,85,Associations of Heavy Metals with Activities of Daily Living Disability: An Epigenome-Wide View of DNA Methylation and Mediation Analysis.,"Exposure to heavy metals has been reported to be associated with multiple diseases. However, direct associations and potential mechanisms of heavy metals with physical disability remain unclear.We aimed to quantify associations of heavy metals with physical disability and further explore the potential mechanisms of DNA methylation on the genome scale.A cross-sectional study of 4,391 older adults was conducted and activities of daily living (ADL) disability were identified using a 14-item scale questionnaire including basic and instrumental activities to assess the presence of disability (yes or no) rated on a scale of dependence. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated to quantify associations between heavy metals and ADL disability prevalence using multivariate logistic regression and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) models. Whole blood-derived DNA methylation was measured using the HumanMethylationEPIC BeadChip array. An ADL disability-related epigenome-wide DNA methylation association study (EWAS) was performed among 212 sex-matched ADL disability cases and controls, and mediation analysis was further applied to explore potential mediators of DNA methylation.Each 1-standard deviation (SD) higher difference inlog10-transformed manganese, copper, arsenic, and cadmium level was significantly associated with a 14% (95% CI: 1.05, 1.24), 16% (95% CI:1.07, 1.26), 22% (95% CI:1.13, 1.33), and 15% (95% CI:1.06, 1.26) higher odds of ADL disability, which remained significant in the multiple-metal and BKMR models. A total of 85 differential DNA methylation sites were identified to be associated with ADL disability prevalence, among which methylation level at cg220000984 and cg23012519 (annotated toIRGMandPKP3) mediated 31.0% and 31.2% of manganese-associated ADL disability prevalence, cg06723863 (annotated toESRP2) mediated 32.4% of copper-associated ADL disability prevalence, cg24433124 (nearest toIER3) mediated 15.8% of arsenic-associated ADL disability prevalence, and cg07905190 and cg17485717 (annotated toFREM1andTCP11L1) mediated 21.5% and 30.5% of cadmium-associated ADL disability prevalence (allp<0.05).Our findings suggested that heavy metals contributed to higher prevalence of ADL disability and that locus-specific DNA methylation are partial mediators, providing potential biomarkers for further cellular mechanism studies. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP10602."

Here, we report an integrated DNA methylation and phenotypic study of the circulating proteome in relation to brain health. Methylome-wide association studies of 4058 plasma proteins are performed (N = 774), identifying 2928 CpG-protein associations after adjustment for multiple testing. These are independent of known genetic protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) and common lifestyle effects. Phenome-wide association studies of each protein are then performed in relation to 15 neurological traits (N = 1,065), identifying 405 associations between the levels of 191 proteins and cognitive scores, brain imaging measures or APOE e4 status. We uncover 35 previously unreported DNA methylation signatures for 17 protein markers of brain health. The epigenetic and proteomic markers we identify are pertinent to understanding and stratifying brain health.© 2022. The Author(s)."

In this study, we investigated the association of altered methylation patterns with SZ symptoms and early trauma in patients and healthy controls.The present study was conducted to identify methylation changes in CpG sites in peripheral blood associated with recent-onset (RO) psychosis using methylome-wide analysis. Lifestyle factors, such as smoking, alcohol, exercise, and diet, were controlled.We identified 2,912 differentially methylated CpG sites in patients with RO psychosis compared to controls. Most of the genes associated with the top 20 differentially methylated sites had not been reported in previous methylation studies and were involved in apoptosis, autophagy, axonal growth, neuroinflammation, protein folding, etc. The top 15 significantly enriched Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways included the oxytocin signaling pathway, long-term depression pathway, axon guidance, endometrial cancer, long-term potentiation, mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, and glutamatergic pathway, among others. In the patient group, significant associations of novel methylated genes with early trauma and psychopathology were observed.Our results suggest an association of differential DNA methylation with the pathophysiology of psychosis and early trauma. Blood DNA methylation signatures show promise as biomarkers of future psychosis."

By studying the epigenetic profile in pre-diagnostic blood samples of melanoma cases and cancer free controls, we aimed to identify DNA methylation sites conferring melanoma risk. DNA methylation was measured at 775,528 CpG sites using the Illumina EPIC array in whole blood in incident melanoma cases (n = 183) and matched cancer-free controls (n = 183) in the Norwegian Women and Cancer cohort. Phenotypic information and ultraviolet radiation exposure were obtained from questionnaires. Epigenome wide association (EWAS) was analyzed in future melanoma cases and controls with conditional logistic regression, with correction for multiple testing using the false discovery rate (FDR). We extended the analysis by including a public data set on melanoma (GSE120878), and combining these different data sets using a version of covariate modulated FDR (AdaPT). The analysis on future melanoma cases and controls did not identify any genome wide significant CpG sites (0.85 ≤ padj ≤ 0.99). In the restricted AdaPT analysis, 7 CpG sites were suggestive at the FDR level of 0.15. These CpG sites may potentially be used as pre-diagnostic biomarkers of melanoma risk.© 2022. The Author(s)."
adults,risk,35947335,Geroscience,type 2 diabetes risk,pre-diagnostic whole blood,132 cases vs 132 controls,107 sites,DNA methylation trajectories and accelerated epigenetic aging in incident type 2 diabetes.,"DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns across the genome changes during aging and development of complex diseases including type 2 diabetes (T2D). Our study aimed to estimate DNAm trajectories of CpG sites associated with T2D, epigenetic age (DNAmAge), and age acceleration based on four epigenetic clocks (GrimAge, Hannum, Horvath, phenoAge) in the period 10 years prior to and up to T2D onset. In this nested case-control study within Doetinchem Cohort Study, we included 132 incident T2D cases and 132 age- and sex-matched controls. DNAm was measured in blood using the Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC array. From 107 CpG sites associated with T2D, 10 CpG sites (9%) showed different slopes of DNAm trajectories over time (p < 0.05) and an additional 8 CpG sites (8%) showed significant differences in DNAm levels (at least 1%, p-value per time point < 0.05) at all three time points with nearly parallel trajectories between incident T2D cases and controls. In controls, age acceleration levels were negative (slower epigenetic aging), while in incident T2D cases, levels were positive, suggesting accelerated aging in the case group. We showed that DNAm levels at specific CpG sites, up to 10 years before T2D onset, are different between incident T2D cases and healthy controls and distinct patterns of clinical traits over time may have an impact on those DNAm profiles. Up to 10 years before T2D diagnosis, cases manifested accelerated epigenetic aging. Markers of biological aging including age acceleration estimates based on Horvath need further investigation to assess their utility for predicting age-related diseases including T2D.© 2022.

Epigenetic regulation plays a key role in infection and inflammation. To reveal the epigenetic relationships between sCD14, immune function and disease progression among PWH, we conducted an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of sCD14 and investigated the relationship with mortality.DNA methylation (DNAm) levels of peripheral blood samples from PWH in the Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS) were measured using the Illumina Infinium Methylation 450K (n = 549) and EPIC (850K) BeadChip (n = 526). Adjusted for covariates and multiple testing, we conducted an epigenome-wide discovery, replication, and meta-analysis to identify significant associations with sCD14. We then examined and replicated the relationship between the principal epigenetic sites and survival using Cox regression models.We identified 118 DNAm sites significantly associated with sCD14 in the meta-analysis of 1075 PWH. The principal associated DNAm sites mapped to genes (e.g. STAT1, PARP9, IFITM1, MX1, and IFIT1) related to inflammation and antiviral response. Adjusting for multiple testing, 10 of 118 sCD14-associated DNAm sites significantly predicted survival time conditional on sCD14 levels.The identification of DNAm sites independently predicting survival may improve our understanding of prognosis and potential therapeutic targets among PWH.Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation (DNAm), have been proposed as an explanation for this association. We examined the association of experiences of trauma with epigenome-wide DNAm among African American mothers (n= 236) and their children aged 3-5 years (n= 232; N = 500), using the Life Events Checklist-5 (LEC) and Traumatic Events Screening Inventory-Parent Report Revised (TESI-PRR). We identified no DNAm sites significantly associated with potentially traumatic experience scores in mothers. One CpG site on theENOX1gene was methylome-wide-significant in children (FDR-corrected q-value = 0.05) from the TESI-PRR. This protein-coding gene is associated with mental illness, including unipolar depression, bipolar, and schizophrenia. Future research should further examine the associations between childhood trauma, DNAm, and health outcomes among this understudied and high-risk group. Findings from such longitudinal research may inform clinical and translational approaches to prevent adverse health outcomes associated with epigenetic changes."

It is proposed that early nutrition may affect neurodevelopmental pathways by altering gene expression through epigenetic modification. Variation in DNA methylation (DNAm) at cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpGs) is a commonly studied epigenetic modification.To assess whether early MM intake by VLBW infants is associated with variations in DNAm at 5.5 years, and whether these variations correlate with neurodevelopmental phenotypes.This cohort study was a 5.5-year follow-up (2016-2018) of VLBW infants born in Ontario, Canada who participated in the Donor Milk for Improved Neurodevelopmental Outcomes trial. We performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) to test whether % MM (not including supplemental donor milk) during hospitalization was associated with DNAm in buccal cells during early childhood (5.7 ± 0.2 years, n = 143; birth weight of 1008 ± 517 grams). DNAm was assessed with the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC array at 814,583 CpGs. In secondary analyses, we tested associations between top-ranked CpGs and measures of early childhood neurodevelopment, e.g., total surface area of the cerebral cortex (n = 41, magnetic resonance imaging) and Full-Scale IQ (n = 133, Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-IV).EWAS analysis demonstrated % MM intake by VLBW infants during hospitalization was associated with DNAm at 2 CpGs, cg03744440 (MYO15B) and cg00851389 (MT1A) at 5.5 years (P < 9E-08). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis indicated that top-ranked CpGs (P < 0.001) were annotated to genes enriched in neurodevelopmental biological processes. Corroborating these findings, DNAm at several top identified CpGs from EWAS was associated with cortical surface area and IQ at 5.5 years (P < 0.05).In-hospital % MM intake by VLBW infants was associated with variations in DNAm of neurodevelopmental genes at 5.5 years; some of these DNAm variations are associated with brain structure and IQ.

This phenomenon mediates, at least in part, the beneficial off-target effects of the BCG vaccine. Using an in vitro model of trained immunity, we show that BCG exposure induces a persistent change in active histone modifications, DNA methylation, transcription, and adenosine-to-inosine RNA modification in human monocytes. By profiling DNA methylation of circulating monocytes from infants in the MIS BAIR clinical trial, we identify a BCG-associated DNA methylation signature that persisted more than 12 months after neonatal BCG vaccination. Genes associated with this epigenetic signature are involved in viral response pathways, consistent with the reported off-target protection against viral infections in neonates, adults, and the elderly. Our findings indicate that the off-target effects of BCG in infants are accompanied by epigenetic remodeling of circulating monocytes that lasts more than 1 year."
