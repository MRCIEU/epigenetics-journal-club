,No,,cell-free DNA,36010184,Tracing the Origin of Cell-Free DNA Molecules through Tissue-Specific Epigenetic Signatures.,Diagnostics (Basel),"All cell and tissue types constantly release DNA fragments into human body fluids by various mechanisms including programmed cell death, accidental cell degradation and active extrusion. Particularly, cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in plasma or serum has been utilized for minimally invasive molecular diagnostics. Disease onset or pathological conditions that lead to increased cell death alter the contribution of different tissues to the total pool of cfDNA. Because cfDNA molecules retain cell-type specific epigenetic features, it is possible to infer tissue-of-origin from epigenetic characteristics. Recent research efforts demonstrated that analysis of, e.g., methylation patterns, nucleosome occupancy, and fragmentomics determined the cell- or tissue-of-origin of individual cfDNA molecules. This novel tissue-of origin-analysis enables to estimate the contributions of different tissues to the total cfDNA pool in body fluids and find tissues with increased cell death (pathologic condition), expanding the portfolio of liquid biopsies towards a wide range of pathologies and early diagnosis. In this review, we summarize the currently available tissue-of-origin approaches and point out the next steps towards clinical implementation."

Here we use machine learning to model megabase-scale mutation burden in 2,500 whole cancer genomes and 17 cancer types via a compendium of 900 CA and RT profiles covering primary cancers, normal tissues, and cell lines. CA profiles of primary cancers, rather than those of normal tissues, are most predictive of regional mutagenesis in most cancer types. Feature prioritisation shows that the epigenomes of matching cancer types and organ systems are often the strongest predictors of regional mutation burden, highlighting disease-specific associations of mutational processes. The genomic distributions of mutational signatures are also shaped by the epigenomes of matched cancer and tissue types, with SBS5/40, carcinogenic and unknown signatures most accurately predicted by our models. In contrast, fewer associations of RT and regional mutagenesis are found. Lastly, the models highlight genomic regions with overrepresented mutations that dramatically exceed epigenome-derived expectations and show a pan-cancer convergence to genes and pathways involved in development and oncogenesis, indicating the potential of this approach for coding and non-coding driver discovery. The association of regional mutational processes with the epigenomes of primary cancers suggests that the landscape of passenger mutations is predominantly shaped by the epigenomes of cancer cells after oncogenic transformation."
,No,,chromatin,35978191,Spatial profiling of chromatin accessibility in mouse and human tissues.,Nature,"Cellular function in tissue is dependent on the local environment, requiring new methods for spatial mapping of biomolecules and cells in the tissue context1. The emergence of spatial transcriptomics has enabled genome-scale gene expression mapping2-5, but the ability to capture spatial epigenetic information of tissue at the cellular level and genome scale is lacking. Here we describe a method for spatially resolved chromatin accessibility profiling of tissue sections using next-generation sequencing (spatial-ATAC-seq) by combining in situ Tn5 transposition chemistry6and microfluidic deterministic barcoding5. Profiling mouse embryos using spatial-ATAC-seq delineated tissue-region-specific epigenetic landscapes and identified gene regulators involved in the development of the central nervous system. Mapping the accessible genome in the mouse and human brain revealed the intricate arealization of brain regions. Applying spatial-ATAC-seq to tonsil tissue resolved the spatially distinct organization of immune cell types and states in lymphoid follicles and extrafollicular zones. This technology progresses spatial biology by enabling spatially resolved chromatin accessibility profiling to improve our understanding of cell identity, cell state and cell fate decision in relation to epigenetic underpinnings in development and disease.© 2022.

We used maternal blood samples collected during the second trimester from a Singaporean longitudinal birth cohort study to examine the association between inter-individual genome-wide DNA methylation and prenatal maternal depressive symptoms. We found that (1) the maternal methylome was significantly associated with prenatal maternal depressive symptomsonlyin mothers with a female fetus; and (2) this sex-dependent association was observed in a comparable, UK-based birth cohort study. Qualitative analyses showed fetal sex-specific differences in genomic features of depression-related CpGs and genes mapped from these CpGs in mothers with female fetuses implicated in a depression-associated WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway. These same genes also showed enriched expression in brain regions linked to major depressive disorder. We also found similar female-specific associations with fetal-facing placenta methylome. Our fetal sex-specific findings provide evidence for maternal-fetal interactions as a mechanism for intergenerational transmission.© 2022 The Authors."

However, direct associations and potential mechanisms of heavy metals with physical disability remain unclear.We aimed to quantify associations of heavy metals with physical disability and further explore the potential mechanisms of DNA methylation on the genome scale.A cross-sectional study of 4,391 older adults was conducted and activities of daily living (ADL) disability were identified using a 14-item scale questionnaire including basic and instrumental activities to assess the presence of disability (yes or no) rated on a scale of dependence. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated to quantify associations between heavy metals and ADL disability prevalence using multivariate logistic regression and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) models. Whole blood-derived DNA methylation was measured using the HumanMethylationEPIC BeadChip array. An ADL disability-related epigenome-wide DNA methylation association study (EWAS) was performed among 212 sex-matched ADL disability cases and controls, and mediation analysis was further applied to explore potential mediators of DNA methylation.Each 1-standard deviation (SD) higher difference inlog10-transformed manganese, copper, arsenic, and cadmium level was significantly associated with a 14% (95% CI: 1.05, 1.24), 16% (95% CI:1.07, 1.26), 22% (95% CI:1.13, 1.33), and 15% (95% CI:1.06, 1.26) higher odds of ADL disability, which remained significant in the multiple-metal and BKMR models. A total of 85 differential DNA methylation sites were identified to be associated with ADL disability prevalence, among which methylation level at cg220000984 and cg23012519 (annotated toIRGMandPKP3) mediated 31.0% and 31.2% of manganese-associated ADL disability prevalence, cg06723863 (annotated toESRP2) mediated 32.4% of copper-associated ADL disability prevalence, cg24433124 (nearest toIER3) mediated 15.8% of arsenic-associated ADL disability prevalence, and cg07905190 and cg17485717 (annotated toFREM1andTCP11L1) mediated 21.5% and 30.5% of cadmium-associated ADL disability prevalence (allp<0.05).Our findings suggested that heavy metals contributed to higher prevalence of ADL disability and that locus-specific DNA methylation are partial mediators, providing potential biomarkers for further cellular mechanism studies. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP10602."

Genotyping was performed using Illumina HumanOmniExpressExome-8 BeadChips and gene expression using Ion AmpliSeq Human Gene Expression Core Panel. Treatment escalation was characterised by the need for biological agents or surgery after initial disease remission.A total of 137 differentially methylated positions (DMP) were identified in IBD, including VMP1/MIR21 (p=9.11×10 -15) and RPS6KA2 (6.43×10 -13); with consistency seen across Scandinavia and UK. Dysregulated loci demonstrate strong genetic influence, notably VMP1 (p=1.53×10 -15). Age acceleration is seen in IBD (coefficient 0.94, p<2.2x10 -16). Several immuno-active genes demonstrated highly significant correlations between methylation and gene expression in IBD, in particular OSM: IBD r -0.32, p 3.64×10 -7 vs. non-IBD r -0.14, p=0.77). Multi-omic integration of methylome, genome and transcriptome also implicate specific pathways that associate with immune activation, response and regulation at disease inception. At follow up, a signature of 3 DMPs (TAP1, TESPA1, RPTOR) associated with treatment escalation to biological agents or surgery (hazard ratio of 5.19 (CI:2.14-12.56, logrank p=9.70×10 -4).These data demonstrate consistent epigenetic alterations at diagnosis in European patients with IBD, providing insights into the pathogenetic importance and translational potential of epigenetic mapping in complex disease.© The Author(s) 2022.

,No,,ewas,36017556,Epigenome-wide association studies of occupational exposure to benzene and formaldehyde.,Epigenetics,"relationship between certain myeloid neoplasms and exposure to benzene or formaldehyde. DNA methylation could underlie benzene- and formaldehyde-induced health outcomes, but data in exposed human populations are limited. We conducted two cross-sectional epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS), one in workers exposed to benzene and another in workers exposed to formaldehyde. Using HumanMethylation450 BeadChips, we investigated differences in blood cell DNA methylation among 50 benzene-exposed subjects and 48 controls, and among 31 formaldehyde-exposed subjects and 40 controls. We performed CpG-level and regional-level analyses. In the benzene EWAS, we found genome-wide significant alterations, i.e., FWER-controlledP-values <0.05, in the mean and variance of methylation at 22 and 318 CpG sites, respectively, and in mean methylation of a large genomic region. Pathway analysis of genes corresponding to benzene-associated differential methylation sites revealed an impact on the AMPK signalling pathway. In formaldehyde-exposed subjects compared to controls, 9 CpGs in theDUSP22gene promoter had genome-wide significant decreased methylation variability and a large region of theHOXA5promoter with 44 CpGs was hypomethylated. Our findings suggest that DNA methylation may contribute to the pathogenesis of diseases related to benzene and formaldehyde exposure. Aberrant expression and methylation ofHOXA5previously has been shown to be clinically significant in myeloid leukaemias. The tumour suppressor geneDUSP22is a potential biomarker of exposure to formaldehyde, and irregularities have been associated with multiple exposures and diseases."
,Yes,,ewas,36012217,Experiences of Trauma and DNA Methylation Profiles among African American Mothers and Children.,Int J Mol Sci,"Potentially traumatic experiences have been associated with chronic diseases. Epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation (DNAm), have been proposed as an explanation for this association. We examined the association of experiences of trauma with epigenome-wide DNAm among African American mothers (n= 236) and their children aged 3-5 years (n= 232; N = 500), using the Life Events Checklist-5 (LEC) and Traumatic Events Screening Inventory-Parent Report Revised (TESI-PRR). We identified no DNAm sites significantly associated with potentially traumatic experience scores in mothers. One CpG site on theENOX1gene was methylome-wide-significant in children (FDR-corrected q-value = 0.05) from the TESI-PRR. This protein-coding gene is associated with mental illness, including unipolar depression, bipolar, and schizophrenia. Future research should further examine the associations between childhood trauma, DNAm, and health outcomes among this understudied and high-risk group. Findings from such longitudinal research may inform clinical and translational approaches to prevent adverse health outcomes associated with epigenetic changes."
,Yes,,ewas,35998097,Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Peripheral Blood DNA methylation studies in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,J Crohns Colitis,"Over the past decade, the DNA methylome has been increasingly studied in peripheral blood of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. However, a comprehensive summary and meta-analysis of peripheral blood leukocyte (PBL) DNA methylation studies has thus far not been conducted. Here, we systematically reviewed all available literature up to February 2022 and summarized the observations by means of meta-analysis.We conducted a systematic search and critical appraisal of IBD-associated DNA methylation studies in PBL using the biomarker-based cross-sectional studies (BIOCROSS) tool. Subsequently, we performed meta-analyses on the summary statistics obtained from epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) that included patients with Crohn's Disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and/or healthy controls (HC).Altogether, we included 15 studies for systematic review. Critical appraisal revealed large methodological and outcome heterogeneity between studies. Summary statistics were obtained from 4 studies based on a cumulative 552 samples (177 CD, 132 UC and 243 HC). Consistent differential methylation was identified for 256 differentially methylated probes (DMPs; Bonferroni-adjusted p-value ≤0.05) when comparing CD with HC and 103 when comparing UC with HC. Comparing IBD (CD + UC) with HC resulted in 224 DMPs. Importantly, several of the previously identified DMPs, such as VMP1/TMEM49/MIR21 and RPS6KA2, were consistently differentially methylated across all studies.Methodological homogenization of IBD epigenetic studies is needed to allow for easier aggregation and independent validation. Nonetheless, we were capable of confirming previous observations. Our results can serve as the basis for future IBD epigenetic biomarker research in PBL.© The Author(s) 2022.

Nevertheless, the applications of ctDNA to the early detection and screening of cancer remain highly challenging due to the scarcity of cancer cell-specific ctDNA, the low signal-to-noise ratio of DNA variation, and the lack of non-locus-specific DNA methylation technologies.We enrolled three cohorts of breast cancer (BC) patients from two hospitals in China (BC: n = 123; healthy controls: n = 40). We developed a ctDNA whole-genome bisulfite sequencing technology employing robust trace ctDNA capture from up to 200 μL plasma, mini-input (1 ng) library preparation, unbiased genome-wide coverage and comprehensive computational methods.A diagnostic signature comprising 15 ctDNA methylation markers exhibited high accuracy in the early (area under the curve [AUC] of 0.967) and advanced (AUC of 0.971) BC stages in multicentre patient cohorts. Furthermore, we revealed a ctDNA methylation signature that discriminates estrogen receptor status (Training set: AUC of 0.984 and Test set: AUC of 0.780). Different cancer types, including hepatocellular carcinoma and lung cancer, could also be well distinguished.Our study provides a toolset to generate unbiased whole-genome ctDNA methylomes with a minimal amount of plasma to develop highly specific and sensitive biomarkers for the early diagnosis and molecular subtyping of cancer.© 2022 The Authors.

To explore the role of DNA methylation changes in PD and DLB pathogenesis, we performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of 322 postmortem frontal cortex samples and replicated results in an independent set of 200 donors. We report novel differentially methylated replicating loci associated with Braak Lewy body stage near TMCC2, SFMBT2, AKAP6 and PHYHIP. Differentially methylated probes were independent of known PD genetic risk alleles. Meta-analysis provided suggestive evidence for a differentially methylated locus within the chromosomal region affected by the PD-associated 22q11.2 deletion. Our findings elucidate novel disease pathways in PD and DLB and generate hypotheses for future molecular studies of Lewy body pathology.© 2022. The Author(s)."
,Yes,,ewas,35993851,Molecular networks in atopic mothers impact the risk of infant atopy.,Allergy,"The prevalence of atopic diseases has increased with atopic dermatitis (AD) as the earliest manifestation. We assessed if molecular risk factors in atopic mothers influence their infants' susceptibility to an atopic disease.Pregnant women and their infants with (n=174, high-risk) or without (n=126, low-risk) parental atopy were enrolled in a prospective birth cohort. Global differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were determined in atopic (n=92) and non-atopic (n=82) mothers. Principal component analysis was used to predict atopy risk in children dependent on maternal atopy. Genome-wide transcriptomic analyses were performed in paired atopic (n=20) and non-atopic (n=15) mothers and cord blood. Integrative genomic analyses were conducted to define methylation-gene expression relationships.AD was more prevalent in high-risk compared to low-risk children by age 2. Differential methylation analyses identified 165 DMRs distinguishing atopic from non-atopic mothers. Inclusion of DMRs in addition to maternal atopy significantly increased the odds ratio to develop AD in children from 2.56 to 4.26. In atopic compared to non-atopic mothers, 139 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified significantly enriched of genes within the interferon signaling pathway. Expression quantitative trait methylation analyses dependent on maternal atopy identified 29 DEGs controlled by 136 trans-acting methylation marks, some located near transcription factors. Differential expression for the same 9 genes, including MX1 and IFI6 within the interferon pathway, was identified in atopic and non-atopic mothers and high-risk and low-risk children.These data suggest that in utero epigenetic and transcriptomic mechanisms predominantly involving the interferon pathway may impact and predict the development of infant atopy.This article is protected by copyright.

By studying the epigenetic profile in pre-diagnostic blood samples of melanoma cases and cancer free controls, we aimed to identify DNA methylation sites conferring melanoma risk. DNA methylation was measured at 775,528 CpG sites using the Illumina EPIC array in whole blood in incident melanoma cases (n = 183) and matched cancer-free controls (n = 183) in the Norwegian Women and Cancer cohort. Phenotypic information and ultraviolet radiation exposure were obtained from questionnaires. Epigenome wide association (EWAS) was analyzed in future melanoma cases and controls with conditional logistic regression, with correction for multiple testing using the false discovery rate (FDR). We extended the analysis by including a public data set on melanoma (GSE120878), and combining these different data sets using a version of covariate modulated FDR (AdaPT). The analysis on future melanoma cases and controls did not identify any genome wide significant CpG sites (0.85 ≤ padj ≤ 0.99). In the restricted AdaPT analysis, 7 CpG sites were suggestive at the FDR level of 0.15. These CpG sites may potentially be used as pre-diagnostic biomarkers of melanoma risk.© 2022. The Author(s)."

A cross-tissue analysis that combined these blood DNA methylation datasets with four brain methylation datasets prioritized 97 CpGs and 10 genomic regions that are significantly associated with both AD neuropathology and AD diagnosis. An out-of-sample validation using the AddNeuroMed dataset showed the best performing logistic regression model includes age, sex, immune cell type proportions, and methylation risk score based on prioritized CpGs in cross-tissue analysis (AUC = 0.696, 95% CI: 0.616 - 0.770, P-value = 2.78 × 10-5).

Epigenetic regulation plays a key role in infection and inflammation. To reveal the epigenetic relationships between sCD14, immune function and disease progression among PWH, we conducted an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of sCD14 and investigated the relationship with mortality.DNA methylation (DNAm) levels of peripheral blood samples from PWH in the Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS) were measured using the Illumina Infinium Methylation 450K (n = 549) and EPIC (850K) BeadChip (n = 526). Adjusted for covariates and multiple testing, we conducted an epigenome-wide discovery, replication, and meta-analysis to identify significant associations with sCD14. We then examined and replicated the relationship between the principal epigenetic sites and survival using Cox regression models.We identified 118 DNAm sites significantly associated with sCD14 in the meta-analysis of 1075 PWH. The principal associated DNAm sites mapped to genes (e.g. STAT1, PARP9, IFITM1, MX1, and IFIT1) related to inflammation and antiviral response. Adjusting for multiple testing, 10 of 118 sCD14-associated DNAm sites significantly predicted survival time conditional on sCD14 levels.The identification of DNAm sites independently predicting survival may improve our understanding of prognosis and potential therapeutic targets among PWH.Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

It is proposed that early nutrition may affect neurodevelopmental pathways by altering gene expression through epigenetic modification. Variation in DNA methylation (DNAm) at cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpGs) is a commonly studied epigenetic modification.To assess whether early MM intake by VLBW infants is associated with variations in DNAm at 5.5 years, and whether these variations correlate with neurodevelopmental phenotypes.This cohort study was a 5.5-year follow-up (2016-2018) of VLBW infants born in Ontario, Canada who participated in the Donor Milk for Improved Neurodevelopmental Outcomes trial. We performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) to test whether % MM (not including supplemental donor milk) during hospitalization was associated with DNAm in buccal cells during early childhood (5.7 ± 0.2 years, n = 143; birth weight of 1008 ± 517 grams). DNAm was assessed with the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC array at 814,583 CpGs. In secondary analyses, we tested associations between top-ranked CpGs and measures of early childhood neurodevelopment, e.g., total surface area of the cerebral cortex (n = 41, magnetic resonance imaging) and Full-Scale IQ (n = 133, Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-IV).EWAS analysis demonstrated % MM intake by VLBW infants during hospitalization was associated with DNAm at 2 CpGs, cg03744440 (MYO15B) and cg00851389 (MT1A) at 5.5 years (P < 9E-08). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis indicated that top-ranked CpGs (P < 0.001) were annotated to genes enriched in neurodevelopmental biological processes. Corroborating these findings, DNAm at several top identified CpGs from EWAS was associated with cortical surface area and IQ at 5.5 years (P < 0.05).In-hospital % MM intake by VLBW infants was associated with variations in DNAm of neurodevelopmental genes at 5.5 years; some of these DNAm variations are associated with brain structure and IQ.

In the Comprehensive Assessment of Long-term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy (CALERIE TM) human trial we evaluated associations of CR and changes in whole-blood DNAm.CALERIE TM randomized 220 healthy, non-obese adults in a 2:1 allocation to two years of CR or ad libitum (AL) diet. The average CR in the treatment group through 24-months of follow-up was 12%. Whole blood (baseline, 12 and 24 month) DNAm profiles were measured. Epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) analysis tested CR-induced changes from baseline to 12- and 24-months in the n=197 participants with available DNAm data.CR treatment was not associated with epigenome-wide significant (FDR<0.05) DNAm changes at the individual-CpG-site level. Secondary analysis of sets of CpG sites identified in published EWAS revealed that CR induced DNAm changes opposite to those associated with higher body mass index and cigarette smoking (p<0.003 at 12- and 24-month follow-ups). In contrast, CR altered DNAm at chronological-age associated CpG sites in the direction of older age (p<0.003 at 12- and 24-month follow-ups).Although individual CpG site DNAm changes in response to CR were not identified, analyses of sets CpGs identified in prior EWAS revealed CR-induced changes to blood DNAm. Altered CpG sets were enriched for insulin-production, glucose-tolerance, inflammation, and DNA-binding and -regulation pathways, several of which are known to be modified by CR. DNAm changes may contribute to CR effects on aging.© The Author(s) 2022. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Gerontological Society of America."

Our study aimed to estimate DNAm trajectories of CpG sites associated with T2D, epigenetic age (DNAmAge), and age acceleration based on four epigenetic clocks (GrimAge, Hannum, Horvath, phenoAge) in the period 10 years prior to and up to T2D onset. In this nested case-control study within Doetinchem Cohort Study, we included 132 incident T2D cases and 132 age- and sex-matched controls. DNAm was measured in blood using the Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC array. From 107 CpG sites associated with T2D, 10 CpG sites (9%) showed different slopes of DNAm trajectories over time (p < 0.05) and an additional 8 CpG sites (8%) showed significant differences in DNAm levels (at least 1%, p-value per time point < 0.05) at all three time points with nearly parallel trajectories between incident T2D cases and controls. In controls, age acceleration levels were negative (slower epigenetic aging), while in incident T2D cases, levels were positive, suggesting accelerated aging in the case group. We showed that DNAm levels at specific CpG sites, up to 10 years before T2D onset, are different between incident T2D cases and healthy controls and distinct patterns of clinical traits over time may have an impact on those DNAm profiles. Up to 10 years before T2D diagnosis, cases manifested accelerated epigenetic aging. Markers of biological aging including age acceleration estimates based on Horvath need further investigation to assess their utility for predicting age-related diseases including T2D.© 2022.

In this study, we investigated the association of altered methylation patterns with SZ symptoms and early trauma in patients and healthy controls.The present study was conducted to identify methylation changes in CpG sites in peripheral blood associated with recent-onset (RO) psychosis using methylome-wide analysis. Lifestyle factors, such as smoking, alcohol, exercise, and diet, were controlled.We identified 2,912 differentially methylated CpG sites in patients with RO psychosis compared to controls. Most of the genes associated with the top 20 differentially methylated sites had not been reported in previous methylation studies and were involved in apoptosis, autophagy, axonal growth, neuroinflammation, protein folding, etc. The top 15 significantly enriched Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways included the oxytocin signaling pathway, long-term depression pathway, axon guidance, endometrial cancer, long-term potentiation, mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, and glutamatergic pathway, among others.

x,Yes,,ewas,35930640,Neonatal BCG vaccination is associated with a long-term DNA methylation signature in circulating monocytes.,Sci Adv,"Trained immunity describes the capacity of innate immune cells to develop heterologous memory in response to certain exogenous exposures. This phenomenon mediates, at least in part, the beneficial off-target effects of the BCG vaccine. Using an in vitro model of trained immunity, we show that BCG exposure induces a persistent change in active histone modifications, DNA methylation, transcription, and adenosine-to-inosine RNA modification in human monocytes. By profiling DNA methylation of circulating monocytes from infants in the MIS BAIR clinical trial, we identify a BCG-associated DNA methylation signature that persisted more than 12 months after neonatal BCG vaccination. Genes associated with this epigenetic signature are involved in viral response pathways, consistent with the reported off-target protection against viral infections in neonates, adults, and the elderly. Our findings indicate that the off-target effects of BCG in infants are accompanied by epigenetic remodeling of circulating monocytes that lasts more than 1 year."
,No,,mediation,35989709,Large-Scale Hypothesis Testing for Causal Mediation Effects with Applications in Genome-wide Epigenetic Studies.,J Am Stat Assoc,"In genome-wide epigenetic studies, it is of great scientific interest to assess whether the effect of an exposure on a clinical outcome is mediated through DNA methylations. However, statistical inference for causal mediation effects is challenged by the fact that one needs to test a large number of composite null hypotheses across the whole epigenome. Two popular tests, the Wald-type Sobel's test and the joint significant test using the traditional null distribution are underpowered and thus can miss important scientific discoveries. In this paper, we show that the null distribution of Sobel's test is not the standard normal distribution and the null distribution of the joint significant test is not uniform under the composite null of no mediation effect, especially in finite samples and under the singular point null case that the exposure has no effect on the mediator and the mediator has no effect on the outcome. Our results explain why these two tests are underpowered, and more importantly motivate us to develop a more powerful Divide-Aggregate Composite-null Test (DACT) for the composite null hypothesis of no mediation effect by leveraging epigenome-wide data. We adopted Efron's empirical null framework for assessing statistical significance of the DACT test. We showed analytically that the proposed DACT method had improved power, and could well control type I error rate. Our extensive simulation studies showed that, in finite samples, the DACT method properly controlled the type I error rate and outperformed Sobel's test and the joint significance test for detecting mediation effects. We applied the DACT method to the US Department of Veterans Affairs Normative Aging Study, an ongoing prospective cohort study which included men who were aged 21 to 80 years at entry. We identified multiple DNA methylation CpG sites that might mediate the effect of smoking on lung function with effect sizes ranging from -0.18 to -0.79 and false discovery rate controlled at level 0.05, including the CpG sites in the genes AHRR and F2RL3. Our sensitivity analysis found small residual correlations (less than 0.01) of the error terms between the outcome and mediator regressions, suggesting that our results are robust to unmeasured confounding factors."

We examined the genome-wide false positive (GFP) rates of five widely used DMR methods: comb-p, Bumphunter, DMRcate, mCSEA and coMethDMR using both Illumina HumanMethylation450 (450 K) and MethylationEPIC (EPIC) data and simulated continuous and dichotomous null phenotypes (i.e., generated independently of methylation data). coMethDMR provided well-controlled GFP rates (~5%) except when analysing skewed continuous phenotypes. DMRcate generally had well-controlled GFP rates when applied to 450 K data except for the skewed continuous phenotype and EPIC data only for the normally distributed continuous phenotype. GFP rates for mCSEA were at least 0.096 and comb-p yielded GFP rates above 0.34. Bumphunter had high GFP rates of at least 0.35 across conditions, reaching as high as 0.95. Analysis of the performance of these methods in specific regions of the genome found that regions with higher correlation across loci had higher regional false positive rates on average across methods. Based on the false positive rates, coMethDMR is the most recommended analysis method, and DMRcate had acceptable performance when analysing 450 K data. However, as both could display higher levels of FPs for skewed continuous distributions, a normalizing transformation of skewed continuous phenotypes is suggested. This study highlights the importance of genome-wide simulations when evaluating the performance of DMR-analysis methods."

This article reviews the current state of statistical methods developed for differential variability analysis focusing on DNAm data.With the advent of high-throughput technologies allowing for highly reliable and cost-effective measurements of DNAm, many epigenome studies have analyzed DNAm levels to uncover biological mechanisms underlying past environmental exposures and subsequent health outcomes. These studies typically focused on detecting sites or regions which differ in their mean DNAm levels among exposure groups. However, more recent studies highlighted the importance of identifying differentially variable sites or regions as biologically relevant features. Currently, the analysis of differentially variable DNAm sites has not yet gained widespread adoption in environmental studies; yet, it is important to examine the effects of environmental exposures on inter-individual epigenetic variability. In this article, we describe six of the most widely used statistical approaches for analyzing differential variability of DNAm levels and provide a discussion of their advantages and current limitations.© 2022.

Few studies have explored whether identifying probe subsets based on their biological and statistical properties can maximise predictions whilst minimising array content. Variance component analyses and penalised regression (epigenetic predictors) were used to test the influence of (i) the number of probes considered, (ii) mean probe variability and (iii) methylation QTL status on the variance captured in eighteen traits by blood DNA methylation. Training and test samples comprised ≤ 4450 and ≤ 2578 unrelated individuals from Generation Scotland, respectively.As the number of probes under consideration decreased, so too did the estimates from variance components and prediction analyses. Methylation QTL status and mean probe variability did not influence variance components. However, relative effect sizes were 15% larger for epigenetic predictors based on probes with known or reported methylation QTLs compared to probes without reported methylation QTLs. Relative effect sizes were 45% larger for predictors based on probes with mean Beta-values between 10 and 90% compared to those based on hypo- or hypermethylated probes (Beta-value ≤ 10% or ≥ 90%).Arrays with fewer probes could reduce costs, leading to increased sample sizes for analyses. Our results show that reducing array content can restrict prediction metrics and careful attention must be given to the biological and distribution properties of CpG probes in array content selection.© 2022.

Therefore, artificial intelligence has been recently used to develop prognostic and predictive models of treatment response (either activity/efficacy or toxicity) to aid in clinical decision making. In this systematic review, we have examined the ability of learning methods to predict response to chemotherapy alone or combined with targeted therapy in mCRC patients by targeting specific narrative publications in Medline up to April 2022 to identify appropriate original scientific articles. After the literature search, 26 original articles met inclusion and exclusion criteria and were included in the study. Our results show that all investigations conducted on this field have provided generally promising results in predicting the response to therapy or toxic side-effects. By a meta-analytic approach we found that the overall weighted means of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) were 0.90, 95% C.I. 0.80-0.95 and 0.83, 95% C.I. 0.74-0.89 in training and validation sets, respectively, indicating a good classification performance in discriminating response vs. non-response. The calculation of overall HR indicates that learning models have strong ability to predict improved survival. Lastly, the delta-radiomics and the 74 gene signatures were able to discriminate response vs. non-response by correctly identifying up to 99% of mCRC patients who were responders and up to 100% of patients who were non-responders. Specifically, when we evaluated the predictive models with tests reaching 80% sensitivity (SE) and 90% specificity (SP), the delta radiomics showed an SE of 99% and an SP of 94% in the training set and an SE of 85% and SP of 92 in the test set, whereas for the 74 gene signatures the SE was 97.6% and the SP 100% in the training set."

A robust method to incorporate ""live"" updates of progression risk during follow-up has hitherto been lacking. To address this, we developed a deep learning-based individualised longitudinal survival model using Dynamic-DeepHit-Lite (DDHL) that learns data-driven distribution of time-to-event outcomes. Further refining outputs, we used a reinforcement learning approach (Actor-Critic) for temporal predictive clustering (AC-TPC) to discover groups with similar time-to-event outcomes to support clinical utility. We applied these methods to data from 585 men on AS with longitudinal and comprehensive follow-up (median 4.4 years). Time-dependent C-indices and Brier scores were calculated and compared to Cox regression and landmarking methods. Both Cox and DDHL models including only baseline variables showed comparable C-indices but the DDHL model performance improved with additional follow-up data. With 3 years of data collection and 3 years follow-up the DDHL model had a C-index of 0.79 (±0.11) compared to 0.70 (±0.15) for landmarking Cox and 0.67 (±0.09) for baseline Cox only. Model calibration was good across all models tested. The AC-TPC method further discovered 4 distinct outcome-related temporal clusters with distinct progression trajectories. Those in the lowest risk cluster had negligible progression risk while those in the highest cluster had a 50% risk of progression by 5 years. In summary, we report a novel machine learning approach to inform personalised follow-up during active surveillance which improves predictive power with increasing data input over time.© 2022.

However, not all patients respond to this drug, which sometimes causes life-threatening side effects. Accurately anticipating doxorubicin-resistant patients would therefore permit to spare them this risk while considering alternative treatments without delay. Stratifying patients based on molecular markers in their pretreatment tumors is a promising approach to advance toward this ambitious goal, but single-gene gene markers such as HER2 expression have not shown to be sufficiently predictive. The recent availability of matched doxorubicin-response and diverse molecular profiles across breast cancer patients permits now analysis at a much larger scale. 16 machine learning algorithms and 8 molecular profiles are systematically evaluated on the same cohort of patients. Only 2 of the 128 resulting models are substantially predictive, showing that they can be easily missed by a standard-scale analysis. The best model is classification and regression tree (CART) nonlinearly combining 4 selected miRNA isoforms to predict doxorubicin response (median Matthew correlation coefficient (MCC) and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.56 and 0.80, respectively). By contrast, HER2 expression is significantly less predictive (median MCC and AUC of 0.14 and 0.57, respectively). As the predictive accuracy of this CART model increases with larger training sets, its update with future data should result in even better accuracy.© 2022 The Authors.

Every large hospital produces a wealth of data each day-from simple numerical results from, e.g., sodium measurements to highly complex output of ""-omics"" analyses, as well as quality control results and metadata. Processing, connecting, storing, and ordering extensive parts of these individual data requires Big Data techniques. Whereas novel technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning have exciting application for the augmentation of laboratory medicine, the Big Data concept remains fundamental for any sophisticated data analysis in large databases. To make laboratory medicine data optimally usable for clinical and research purposes, they need to be FAIR: findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. This can be achieved, for example, by automated recording, connection of devices, efficient ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, careful data governance, and modern data security solutions. Enriched with clinical data, laboratory medicine data allow a gain in pathophysiological insights, can improve patient care, or can be used to develop reference intervals for diagnostic purposes. Nevertheless, Big Data in laboratory medicine do not come without challenges: the growing number of analyses and data derived from them is a demanding task to be taken care of. Laboratory medicine experts are and will be needed to drive this development, take an active role in the ongoing digitalization, and provide guidance for their clinical colleagues engaging with the laboratory data in research."

This is achieved through research advancing on: pore efficiency, creating mechanisms to control DNA translocation, enhancing signal-to-noise ratio, and expanding to long-read ranges. Heterogeneity regarding epigenetics would be broad as mutations in the epigenome are sensitive to cause new challenges in cancer research. Epigenetic enzymes which catalyze DNA methylation and histone modification are dysregulated in cancer cells and cause numerous heterogeneous clones to evolve. Detection of this heterogeneity in these clones plays an indispensable role in the treatment of various cancer types. With single-cell profiling, the nanopore sequencing technology could provide a simple sequence at long reads and is expected to be used soon at the bedside or doctor's office.

While FAP accounts for less than 1% of all CRC cases, loss of APC expression is seen in > 80% of non-hereditary CRCs. To better understand molecular mechanisms underlying APC-driven CRC, we performed an epigenome-wide analysis of colon organoids derived from normal-appearing colons of FAP patients versus healthy subjects to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that may precede the onset of CRC.We identified 358 DMRs when comparing colon organoids of FAP patients to those of healthy subjects (FDR < 0.05, |mean beta difference| = 5%). Of these, nearly 50% of DMRs were also differentially methylated in at least one of three CRC tumor and normal adjacent tissue (NAT) cohorts (TCGA-COAD, GSE193535 and ColoCare). Moreover, 27 of the DMRs mapped to CRC genome-wide association study (GWAS) loci. We provide evidence suggesting that some of these DMRs led to significant differences in gene expression of adjacent genes using quantitative PCR. For example, we identified significantly greater expression of five genes: Kazal-type serine peptidase inhibitor domain 1 (KAZALD1, P = 0.032), F-Box and leucine-rich repeat protein 8 (FBXL8, P = 0.036), TRIM31 antisense RNA 1 (TRIM31-AS1, P = 0.036), Fas apoptotic inhibitory molecule 2 (FAIM2, P = 0.049) and (Collagen beta (1-0)galactosyltransferase 2 (COLGALT2, P = 0.049). Importantly, both FBXL8 and TRIM31-AS1 were also significantly differentially expressed in TCGA-COAD tumor versus matched NAT, supporting a role for these genes in CRC tumor development.We performed the first DNA methylome-wide analysis of normal colon organoids derived from FAP patients compared to those of healthy subjects. Our results reveal that normal colon organoids from FAP patients exhibit extensive epigenetic differences compared to those of healthy subjects that appear similar to those exhibited in CRC tumor. Our analyses therefore identify DMRs and candidate target genes that are potentially important in CRC tumor development in FAP, with potential implications for non-hereditary CRC.© 2022.

However, due to extensive linkage disequilibrium (LD) of the genome, it is challenging to identify causal genetic variations that drive DNAm levels by population-based genetic association studies. This limits the utility of mQTLs for fine-mapping risk loci underlying psychiatric disorders identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here we present INTERACT, a deep learning model that integrates convolutional neural networks with transformer, to predict effects of genetic variations on DNAm levels at CpG sites in the human brain. We show that INTERACT-derived DNAm regulatory variants are not confounded by LD, are concentrated in regulatory genomic regions in the human brain, and are convergent with mQTL evidence from genetic association analysis. We further demonstrate that predicted DNAm regulatory variants are enriched for heritability of brain-related traits and improve polygenic risk prediction for schizophrenia across diverse ancestry samples. Finally, we applied predicted DNAm regulatory variants for fine-mapping schizophrenia GWAS risk loci to identify potential novel risk genes. Our study shows the power of a deep learning approach to identify functional regulatory variants that may elucidate the genetic basis of complex traits."

In this work, we considered the epigenetic analog of PRS, methylation risk scores (MRS), a linear combination of methylation states. We measured methylation across a large cohort (n = 831) of diverse samples in the UCLA Health biobank, for which both genetic and complete EHR data are available. We constructed MRS for 607 phenotypes spanning diagnoses, clinical lab tests, and medication prescriptions. When added to a baseline set of predictive features, MRS significantly improved the imputation of 139 outcomes, whereas the PRS improved only 22 (median improvement for methylation 10.74%, 141.52%, and 15.46% in medications, labs, and diagnosis codes, respectively, whereas genotypes only improved the labs at a median increase of 18.42%). We added significant MRS to state-of-the-art EHR imputation methods that leverage the entire set of medical records, and found that including MRS as a medical feature in the algorithm significantly improves EHR imputation in 37% of lab tests examined (median R2increase 47.6%). Finally, we replicated several MRS in multiple external studies of methylation (minimum p-value of 2.72 × 10-7) and replicated 22 of 30 tested MRS internally in two separate cohorts of different ethnicity.

Many existing feature attribution methods are optimized for continuous rather than discrete input patterns and assess individual feature importance in isolation, making them ill-suited for interpreting non-linear interactions in molecular sequences. Building on work in computer vision and natural language processing, we developed an approach based on deep learning - Scrambler networks - wherein the most salient sequence positions are identified with learned input masks. Scramblers learn to predict Position-Specific Scoring Matrices (PSSMs) where unimportant nucleotides or residues are scrambled by raising their entropy. We apply Scramblers to interpret the effects of genetic variants, uncover non-linear interactions between cis-regulatory elements, explain binding specificity for protein-protein interactions, and identify structural determinants ofde novodesigned proteins. We show that Scramblers enable efficient attribution across large datasets and result in high-quality explanations, often outperforming state-of-the-art methods."
