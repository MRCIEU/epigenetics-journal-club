"36047742","An evaluation of the genome-wide false positive rates of common methods for identifying differentially methylated regions using illumina methylation arrays.","Epigenetics","Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) are genomic regions with specific methylation patterns across multiple loci that are associated with a phenotype. We examined the genome-wide false positive (GFP) rates of five widely used DMR methods: comb-p, Bumphunter, DMRcate, mCSEA and coMethDMR using both Illumina HumanMethylation450 (450 K) and MethylationEPIC (EPIC) data and simulated continuous and dichotomous null phenotypes (i.e., generated independently of methylation data). coMethDMR provided well-controlled GFP rates (~5%) except when analysing skewed continuous phenotypes. DMRcate generally had well-controlled GFP rates when applied to 450 K data except for the skewed continuous phenotype and EPIC data only for the normally distributed continuous phenotype. GFP rates for mCSEA were at least 0.096 and comb-p yielded GFP rates above 0.34. Bumphunter had high GFP rates of at least 0.35 across conditions, reaching as high as 0.95. Analysis of the performance of these methods in specific regions of the genome found that regions with higher correlation across loci had higher regional false positive rates on average across methods. Based on the false positive rates, coMethDMR is the most recommended analysis method, and DMRcate had acceptable performance when analysing 450 K data. However, as both could display higher levels of FPs for skewed continuous distributions, a normalizing transformation of skewed continuous phenotypes is suggested. This study highlights the importance of genome-wide simulations when evaluating the performance of DMR-analysis methods."

Genes showing differences in DNA methylation levels between the low-recurrence-risk category and intermediate- and high-risk categories were accumulated in pathways related to fibroblast growth factor and nuclear factor-κB signaling. DNA hypomethylation and overexpression ofZBTB38were frequently observed in the low-risk category. Eight hundred thirty-one marker CpG probes showed area under the curve values of >0.7 on the receiver operating characteristic curve for discrimination of patients belonging to the low-risk category. By combining marker CpG sites, seven panels for placing patients into the low-risk category with 91.3% or more sensitivity and specificity in both the initial and second cohorts were established.DNA methylation diagnostics criteria using up to 6 of 8 CpG sites forLPP,FOXO1,RNF4,EXOC6B,CCPG1,RREB1andZBTB38may be applicable to recurrence risk estimation for patients aged 40 years or less with endometrial cancer, regardless of tumor cell content, even if formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded biopsy or curettage materials are used.Copyright © 2022.

"36046686","Pan-Cancer Analysis of PDIA3: Identifying It as a Potential Biomarker for Tumor Prognosis and Immunotherapy.","Oxid Med Cell Longev","Protein disulfide isomerase A3 (PDIA3) is a kind of thiol oxidoreductase with a wide range of functions, and its expression is elevated in a variety of tumors, which is closely related to the invasion and metastasis of tumor cells, and has a significant impact on the immunogenicity of tumor cells. Although more and more studies have shown that PDIA3 plays an important role in the occurrence and development of many tumors, there is no systematic pan-cancer study on PDIA3. Therefore, in this study, the differential expression of PDIA3 in 33 kinds of tumors was analyzed to explore its ability to regulate tumor immunity as a biomarker and evaluate its role in different cancer onset stages or clinical prognosis. In this paper, by analyzing the multilevel data including 33 kinds of cancers in the databases of Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), UCSC Xena, Cancer Cell Encyclopedia (CCLE), Genotypic Tissue Expression (GTEx), Human Protein Atlas (HPA), cBioPortal, and GDC; the differential expression level of PDIA3 in different types of malignant tumors and its relationship with prognosis and the potential correlation between PDIA3 expression and microsatellite instability (MSI), tumor mutation load (TMB), mismatch repair gene (MMR), DNA methylation level, and immune infiltration level were analyzed with bioinformatics. The results showed that PDIA3 was highly expressed in 19 types of cancers, but downregulated only in THCA. Next, PDIA3 in different tumors was positively or negatively correlated with patient outcome, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that PDIA3 plays an important role in the prognosis of patients with KIRP, KICH, and CESC and may be used as a prognostic biomarker, and the methylation level of PDIA3 promoter region was closely related to patient outcome in eight tumors. The expression level of PDIA3 was correlated with TMB in 13 tumors and MSI in 9 tumors. Among them, the expression level of PDIA3 in THYM has the strongest correlation with TMB, and the expression level of PDIA3 in READ has the strongest correlation with MSI. In addition, the expression of PDIA3 in eight kinds of tumors, including BRCA, HNSC, THYM, LGG, LUAD, LUSC, PRAD, and THCA, had the highest correlation with the infiltration degree of immune cells, and the expression of PDIA3 had the highest correlation with the infiltration degree of 11 kinds of immune cells, including regulatory T cell and macrophages. And LGG is the tumor most likely to be affected by the tumor microenvironment to affect its development and prognosis. To sum up, this study suggests that PDIA3 plays an important role in the occurrence and development of KIRP, KICH, and CESC and in the immunotherapeutic response of THYM, READ, and LGG and can be used as a prognostic biomarker for these tumors.Copyright © 2022 Jing Zhang et al."

We used maternal blood samples collected during the second trimester from a Singaporean longitudinal birth cohort study to examine the association between inter-individual genome-wide DNA methylation and prenatal maternal depressive symptoms. We found that (1) the maternal methylome was significantly associated with prenatal maternal depressive symptomsonlyin mothers with a female fetus; and (2) this sex-dependent association was observed in a comparable, UK-based birth cohort study. Qualitative analyses showed fetal sex-specific differences in genomic features of depression-related CpGs and genes mapped from these CpGs in mothers with female fetuses implicated in a depression-associated WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway. These same genes also showed enriched expression in brain regions linked to major depressive disorder. We also found similar female-specific associations with fetal-facing placenta methylome. Our fetal sex-specific findings provide evidence for maternal-fetal interactions as a mechanism for intergenerational transmission.© 2022 The Authors."
"36041633","MeDIP-seq and RNA-seq analysis during porcine testis development reveals functional DMRs at the promoter of LDHC.","Genomics","Testis development requires tight regulation of gene expression programmed by epigenetic modifiers. However, their mechanism remains to be elucidated. Here, we investigated the genome-wide DNA methylation landscape in the Duroc and Meishan boar testes using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-seq). We identified over 1100 promoter differential methylation genes (DMGs) before and after puberty, most of which are associated with testis development. Furthermore, we discovered that the expression of lactate dehydrogenase C (LDHC) gene during testis development is regulated by DNA methylation. The promoter of LDHC in pre-pubertal testes is substantially methylated, whereas considerably demethylated in post-pubertal testes. Artificial demethylation with the demethylating agent 5-Aza-CdR induced LDHC expression in immature Sertoli cells (SCs). Mechanistically, we confirmed the transcription factor SP1 was recruited to bind in hypomethylated differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in LDHC promoter, which upregulated the expression of LDHC. Functionally, we demonstrated that LDHC gene was activated in mature SCs (mSCs) and its overexpression significantly increases lactate secretion in SCs. In conclusion, our results highlight the function and regulation of dynamic DNA methylation in testis development.Copyright © 2022. Published by Elsevier Inc."

"36038624","Genetics of autism spectrum disorders and future direction.","J Hum Genet","Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) have been increasing in prevalence. ASD is a complex human genetic disorder with high heredity and involves interactions between genes and the environment. A significant inheritance pattern in ASD involves a rare genetic mutation; common copy number variants refer to duplication or deletion of stretches of chromosomal loci or protein-disrupting single-nucleotide variants. Haploinsufficiency is one of the more common single-gene causes of ASD, explaining at least 0.5% of cases. Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, act at an interface of genetic and environmental risk and protective factors. Advances in genome-wide sequencing have broadened the view of the human methylome and have revealed the organization of the human genome into large-scale methylation domains with a footprint over neurologically important genes involved in embryonic development. Psychiatric disorders, including ASD, are expected to be diagnosed based on their genetically regulated pathophysiology and to be linked to their treatment.© 2022.

"36036911","Decreased Levels of DNA Methylation in the PCDHA Gene Cluster as a Risk Factor for Early-Onset High Myopia in Young Children.","Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci","High myopia (HM), an eye disorder with at least -6.0 diopters refractive error, has a complex etiology with environmental, genetic, and likely epigenetic factors involved. To complement the DNA methylation assessment in children with HM, we analyzed genes that had significantly lower DNA methylation levels.The DNA methylation pattern was studied based on the genome-wide methylation data of 18 Polish children with HM paired with 18 controls. Genes overlapping CG dinucleotides with decreased methylation level in HM cases were assessed by enrichment analyses. From those, genes with CG dinucleotides in promoter regions were further evaluated based on exome sequencing (ES) data of 16 patients with HM from unrelated Polish families, Sanger sequencing data of the studied children, and the RNA sequencing data of human retinal ARPE-19 cells.The CG dinucleotide with the most decreased methylation level in cases was identified in a promoter region of PCDHA10 that overlaps intronic regions of PCDHA1-9 of the PCDHA gene cluster in myopia 5q31 locus. Also, two single nucleotide variants, rs200661444, detected in our ES, and rs246073, previously found as associated with a refractive error in a genome-wide association study, were revealed within this gene cluster. Additionally, genes previously linked to ocular phenotypes, myopia-related traits, or loci, including ADAM20, ZFAND6, ETS1, ABHD13, SBSPON, SORBS2, LMOD3, ATXN1, and FARP2, were found to have decreased methylation.Alterations in the methylation pattern of specific CG dinucleotides may be associated with early-onset HM, so this could be used to develop noninvasive biomarkers of HM in children and adolescents."

However, direct associations and potential mechanisms of heavy metals with physical disability remain unclear.We aimed to quantify associations of heavy metals with physical disability and further explore the potential mechanisms of DNA methylation on the genome scale.A cross-sectional study of 4,391 older adults was conducted and activities of daily living (ADL) disability were identified using a 14-item scale questionnaire including basic and instrumental activities to assess the presence of disability (yes or no) rated on a scale of dependence. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated to quantify associations between heavy metals and ADL disability prevalence using multivariate logistic regression and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) models. Whole blood-derived DNA methylation was measured using the HumanMethylationEPIC BeadChip array. An ADL disability-related epigenome-wide DNA methylation association study (EWAS) was performed among 212 sex-matched ADL disability cases and controls, and mediation analysis was further applied to explore potential mediators of DNA methylation.Each 1-standard deviation (SD) higher difference inlog10-transformed manganese, copper, arsenic, and cadmium level was significantly associated with a 14% (95% CI: 1.05, 1.24), 16% (95% CI:1.07, 1.26), 22% (95% CI:1.13, 1.33), and 15% (95% CI:1.06, 1.26) higher odds of ADL disability, which remained significant in the multiple-metal and BKMR models. A total of 85 differential DNA methylation sites were identified to be associated with ADL disability prevalence, among which methylation level at cg220000984 and cg23012519 (annotated toIRGMandPKP3) mediated 31.0% and 31.2% of manganese-associated ADL disability prevalence, cg06723863 (annotated toESRP2) mediated 32.4% of copper-associated ADL disability prevalence, cg24433124 (nearest toIER3) mediated 15.8% of arsenic-associated ADL disability prevalence, and cg07905190 and cg17485717 (annotated toFREM1andTCP11L1) mediated 21.5% and 30.5% of cadmium-associated ADL disability prevalence (allp<0.05).Our findings suggested that heavy metals contributed to higher prevalence of ADL disability and that locus-specific DNA methylation are partial mediators, providing potential biomarkers for further cellular mechanism studies. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP10602."
"36036141","[DNA methylation in experimental ischemic brain injury].","Zh Nevrol Psikhiatr Im S S Korsakova","The enrichment of angioneurology with fundamental advances leads to the understanding of new important facets in the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia. The knowledge of epigenetic mechanisms in the development of stroke, in particular, DNA methylation, which makes a significant contribution to the development and formation of cerebral damage, is becoming more and more relevant. This review reflects an analysis of animal studies proving the relationship of DNA methylation with cerebral ischemia. As a result of the search work, 282 articles from the PubMed database were selected for keywords that corresponded to this topic. Of these publications, 8 studies were devoted to genome-wide DNA methylation, and 6 published the results of DNA methylation of candidate genes in experimental cerebral ischemia. The results have demonstrated that brain DNA methylation in animals is associated with the development of ischemic stroke and may play a role in several pathogenetic mechanisms. In two studies, a decrease in the level of DNA methylation in 2 genes in ischemic brain tissues of laboratory animals was found, at the same time, in four studies, 8 genes, in which methylation increased after ischemic stroke, were reported. These data suggest that the assessment of the level of DNA methylation in stroke is a promising biomarker for the search and improvement of pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods for limiting brain damage in ischemic and reperfusion injury at the stages of preclinical and clinical studies."

Hereinto, the histone methylation tunes the gene transcriptionviamodulation of the chromatin accessibility to transcription machinery. Osmotic stress, which is caused by water deprivation or high concentration of ions, can trigger remarkable changes in histone methylation landscape and genome-wide reprogramming of transcription. However, the dynamic regulation of genes, especially how stress-inducible genes are timely epi-regulated by histone methylation remains largely unclear. In this review, recent findings on the interaction between histone (de)methylation and osmotic stress were summarized, with emphasis on the effects on histone methylation profiles imposed by stress and how histone methylation works to optimize the performance of plants under stress.Copyright © 2022 Xiao, Wang and Xu."

Epigenetic regulation refers to genome-wide molecular events, including DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA regulation, represented by microRNA (miRNA), long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), and circular RNA (circRNA). Epigenetic regulation is pervasively occurred in the genome and emerges as a new role in gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Currently, it is well-recognized that epigenetic factors are determinants in regulating gene expression patterns, and may provide evolutionary mechanisms that influence the wound microenvironments and the entire healing course. Therefore, this review aims to comprehensively summarize the emerging roles and mechanisms of epigenetic remodeling in wound healing. Moreover, we also pose the challenges and future perspectives related to epigenetic modifications in wound healing, which would bring novel insights to accelerated wound healing.Copyright © 2022 Yu, Wang, Wang, Yi, Liu, Wu, Wu and Zhang."
"36035246","Omics-informed CNV calls reduce false-positive rates and improve power for CNV-trait associations.","HGG Adv","Copy-number variations (CNV) are believed to play an important role in a wide range of complex traits, but discovering such associations remains challenging. While whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is the gold-standard approach for CNV detection, there are several orders of magnitude more samples with available genotyping microarray data. Such array data can be exploited for CNV detection using dedicated software (e.g., PennCNV); however, these calls suffer from elevated false-positive and -negative rates. In this study, we developed a CNV quality score that weights PennCNV calls (pCNVs) based on their likelihood of being true positive. First, we established a measure of pCNV reliability by leveraging evidence from multiple omics data (WGS, transcriptomics, and methylomics) obtained from the same samples. Next, we built a predictor of omics-confirmed pCNVs, termed omics-informed quality score (OQS), using only PennCNV software output parameters. Promisingly, OQS assigned to pCNVs detected in close family members was up to 35% higher than the OQS of pCNVs not carried by other relatives (p < 3.0 × 10-90), outperforming other scores. Finally, in an association study of four anthropometric traits in 89,516 Estonian Biobank samples, the use of OQS led to a relative increase in the trait variance explained by CNVs of up to 56% compared with published quality filtering methods or scores. Overall, we put forward a flexible framework to improve any CNV detection method leveraging multi-omics evidence, applied it to improve PennCNV calls, and demonstrated its utility by improving the statistical power for downstream association analyses.© 2022 The Author(s)."
"36035158","Elevated exposures to persistent endocrine disrupting compounds impact the sperm methylome in regions associated with autism spectrum disorder.","Front Genet","Environmental exposures to endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) such as the organochlorines have been linked with various diseases including neurodevelopmental disorders. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly complex neurodevelopmental disorder that is considered strongly genetic in origin due to its high heritability. However, the rapidly rising prevalence of ASD suggests that environmental factors may also influence risk for ASD. In the present study, whole genome bisulfite sequencing was used to identify genome-wide differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in a total of 52 sperm samples from a cohort of men from the Faroe Islands (Denmark) who were equally divided into high and low exposure groups based on their serum levels of the long-lived organochlorine 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene (DDE), a primary breakdown product of the now banned insecticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). Aside from being considered a genetic isolate, inhabitants of the Faroe Islands have a native diet that potentially exposes them to a wide range of seafood neurotoxicants in the form of persistent organic pollutants (POPs). The DMRs were mapped to the human genome using Bismark, a 3-letter aligner used for methyl-seq analyses. Gene ontology, functional, and pathway analyses of the DMR-associated genes showed significant enrichment for genes involved in neurological functions and neurodevelopmental processes frequently impacted by ASD. Notably, these genes also significantly overlap with autism risk genes as well as those previously identified in sperm from fathers of children with ASD in comparison to that of fathers of neurotypical children. These results collectively suggest a possible mechanism involving altered methylation of a significant number of neurologically relevant ASD risk genes for introducing epigenetic changes associated with environmental exposures into the sperm methylome. Such changes may provide the potential for transgenerational inheritance of ASD as well as other disorders.Copyright © 2022 Maggio, Shu, Laufer, Bi, Lai, LaSalle and Hu."
"36032246","The mediating role of transmembrane protein 132D methylation in predicting the occurrence of panic disorder in physical abuse.","Front Psychiatry","Genome Wide Association study (GWAS) has revealed that the transmembrane protein 132D (TMEM132D) is a gene of sensitive for panic disorder (PD). As the main type of childhood trauma experience, childhood abuse has become a public health issue attracting much attention at home and abroad, and has been proved to be a risk factor for the onset of PD. However, how it affects the occurrence and development of panic disorder has not yet been revealed. We examined the relationship between TMEM132D methylation, childhood abuse and symptoms based on this finding.Thirty-two patients with PD and 22 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited after age, gender, and the education level were matched. The DNA methylation levels of CpG sites across the genome were examined with genomic DNA samples (PD,N= 32, controls,N= 22) extracted from subjects' elbow venous blood. A mediation model was used to explore the relationship between the methylation degree of different CpG sites and childhood maltreatment and clinical symptoms.We found that the PD group had significantly lower methylation at CpG1, CpG2, CpG3, CpG4, CpG5, CpG6, CpG7, CpG8, CpG11, CpG14, and CpG18 than did the HCs (p< 0.05). The CpG2 (r= 0.5953,p= 0.0117) site in the priming region of TEME132D gene were positively associated with PDSS score. The CpG2 (r= 0.4889,p= 0.046) site in the priming region of TEME132D gene were positively associated with physical abuse. Furthermore, path analyses showed that the methylation of CpG2 of TMEM132D played a fully mediating role in the relationship between physical abuse and PD symptom severity (95.Childhood abuse experiences, especially physical abuse, are significantly related to PD. The methylation of CpG2 of TMEM132D was shown to have a fully mediating effect between panic disorder and physical abuse.

Genotyping was performed using Illumina HumanOmniExpressExome-8 BeadChips and gene expression using Ion AmpliSeq Human Gene Expression Core Panel. Treatment escalation was characterised by the need for biological agents or surgery after initial disease remission.A total of 137 differentially methylated positions (DMP) were identified in IBD, including VMP1/MIR21 (p=9.11×10 -15) and RPS6KA2 (6.43×10 -13); with consistency seen across Scandinavia and UK. Dysregulated loci demonstrate strong genetic influence, notably VMP1 (p=1.53×10 -15). Age acceleration is seen in IBD (coefficient 0.94, p<2.2x10 -16). Several immuno-active genes demonstrated highly significant correlations between methylation and gene expression in IBD, in particular OSM: IBD r -0.32, p 3.64×10 -7 vs. non-IBD r -0.14, p=0.77).

DNA methylation could underlie benzene- and formaldehyde-induced health outcomes, but data in exposed human populations are limited. We conducted two cross-sectional epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS), one in workers exposed to benzene and another in workers exposed to formaldehyde. Using HumanMethylation450 BeadChips, we investigated differences in blood cell DNA methylation among 50 benzene-exposed subjects and 48 controls, and among 31 formaldehyde-exposed subjects and 40 controls. We performed CpG-level and regional-level analyses. In the benzene EWAS, we found genome-wide significant alterations, i.e., FWER-controlledP-values <0.05, in the mean and variance of methylation at 22 and 318 CpG sites, respectively, and in mean methylation of a large genomic region. Pathway analysis of genes corresponding to benzene-associated differential methylation sites revealed an impact on the AMPK signalling pathway. In formaldehyde-exposed subjects compared to controls, 9 CpGs in theDUSP22gene promoter had genome-wide significant decreased methylation variability and a large region of theHOXA5promoter with 44 CpGs was hypomethylated. Our findings suggest that DNA methylation may contribute to the pathogenesis of diseases related to benzene and formaldehyde exposure. Aberrant expression and methylation ofHOXA5previously has been shown to be clinically significant in myeloid leukaemias. The tumour suppressor geneDUSP22is a potential biomarker of exposure to formaldehyde, and irregularities have been associated with multiple exposures and diseases."
"36013497","Mechanisms Linking COPD to Type 1 and 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Is There a Relationship between Diabetes and COPD?","Medicina (Kaunas)","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients frequently suffer from multiple comorbidities, resulting in poor outcomes for these patients. Diabetes is observed at a higher frequency in COPD patients than in the general population. Both type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus are associated with pulmonary complications, and similar therapeutic strategies are proposed to treat these conditions. Epidemiological studies and disease models have increased our knowledge of these clinical associations. Several recent genome-wide association studies have identified positive genetic correlations between lung function and obesity, possibly due to alterations in genes linked to cell proliferation; embryo, skeletal, and tissue development; and regulation of gene expression. These studies suggest that genetic predisposition, in addition to weight gain, can influence lung function. Cigarette smoke exposure can also influence the differential methylation of CpG sites in genes linked to diabetes and COPD, and smoke-related single nucleotide polymorphisms are associated with resting heart rate and coronary artery disease. Despite the vast literature on clinical disease association, little direct mechanistic evidence is currently available demonstrating that either disease influences the progression of the other, but common pharmacological approaches could slow the progression of these diseases. Here, we review the clinical and scientific literature to discuss whether mechanisms beyond preexisting conditions, lifestyle, and weight gain contribute to the development of COPD associated with diabetes. Specifically, we outline environmental and genetic confounders linked with these diseases."
"36012581","The Chromatin Remodeler HELLS: A New Regulator in DNA Repair, Genome Maintenance, and Cancer.","Int J Mol Sci","Robust, tightly regulated DNA repair is critical to maintaining genome stability and preventing cancer. Eukaryotic DNA is packaged into chromatin, which has a profound, yet incompletely understood, regulatory influence on DNA repair and genome stability. The chromatin remodeler HELLS (helicase, lymphoid specific) has emerged as an important epigenetic regulator of DNA repair, genome stability, and multiple cancer-associated pathways. HELLS belongs to a subfamily of the conserved SNF2 ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complexes, which use energy from ATP hydrolysis to alter nucleosome structure and packaging of chromatin during the processes of DNA replication, transcription, and repair. The mouse homologue, LSH (lymphoid-specific helicase), plays an important role in the maintenance of heterochromatin and genome-wide DNA methylation, and is crucial in embryonic development, gametogenesis, and maturation of the immune system. Human HELLS is abundantly expressed in highly proliferating cells of the lymphoid tissue, skin, germ cells, and embryonic stem cells. Mutations in HELLS cause the human immunodeficiency syndrome ICF (Immunodeficiency, Centromeric instability, Facial anomalies). HELLS has been implicated in many types of cancer, including retinoblastoma, colorectal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and glioblastoma. Here, we review and summarize accumulating evidence highlighting important roles for HELLS in DNA repair, genome maintenance, and key pathways relevant to cancer development, progression, and treatment."

Epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation (DNAm), have been proposed as an explanation for this association. We examined the association of experiences of trauma with epigenome-wide DNAm among African American mothers (n= 236) and their children aged 3-5 years (n= 232; N = 500), using the Life Events Checklist-5 (LEC) and Traumatic Events Screening Inventory-Parent Report Revised (TESI-PRR). We identified no DNAm sites significantly associated with potentially traumatic experience scores in mothers. One CpG site on theENOX1gene was methylome-wide-significant in children (FDR-corrected q-value = 0.05) from the TESI-PRR. This protein-coding gene is associated with mental illness, including unipolar depression, bipolar, and schizophrenia. Future research should further examine the associations between childhood trauma, DNAm, and health outcomes among this understudied and high-risk group. Findings from such longitudinal research may inform clinical and translational approaches to prevent adverse health outcomes associated with epigenetic changes."
"36011357","Comparative Transcriptomics and Methylomics Reveal Adaptive Responses of Digestive and Metabolic Genes to Dietary Shift in Giant and Red Pandas.","Genes (Basel)","Both the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) and red panda (Ailurus fulgens) belong to the order Carnivora, but have changed their dietary habits to eating bamboo exclusively. The convergent evolution characteristics of their morphology, genome and gut flora have been found in the two pandas. However, the research on the convergent adaptation of their digestion and metabolism to the bamboo diet, mediated by the dietary shift of the two pandas at the gene-expression and epigenetic regulation levels, is still lacking. We therefore used RNA sequencing among five species (two pandas and three non-herbivore mammals) and bisulfite sequencing among three species (two pandas and a carnivore ferret) to sequence key digestion and metabolism tissues (stomach and small intestine). Our results provide evidence that the convergent differentially expressed genes (related to carbohydrate utilization, bile secretion, Lys and Arg metabolism, vitamin B12 utilization and cyanide detoxification) of the two pandas are adaptive responses to the bamboo diet containing low lipids, low Lys and Arg, low vitamin B12 and high cyanide. We also profiled the genome-wide methylome maps of giant panda, red panda and ferret, and the results indicated that the promoter methylation of the two pandas may regulate digestive and metabolic genes to adapt to sudden environmental changes, and then, transmit genetic information to future generations to evolve into bamboo eaters. Taken together, our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of the dietary shift and the adaptation to a strict bamboo diet in both pandas using comparative transcriptomics and methylomics."
"36011346","The Cannabis-Induced Epigenetic Regulation of Genes Associated with Major Depressive Disorder.","Genes (Basel)","The prevalence of depression is increasing worldwide, as is the number of people suffering from treatment-resistant depression; these patients constitute 30% of those treated. Unfortunately, there have not been significant advances in the treatment of this disorder in the past few decades. Exposure to cannabis and cannabis-derived compounds impacts depression symptomatology in different ways, with evidence indicating that cannabidiol has antidepressant effects; there have been mixed results with medical cannabis. Even though the exact molecular mechanisms of the action underlying changes in depression symptomatology upon exposure to cannabis and cannabis-derived compounds are still unknown, there is strong evidence that these agents have a widespread impact on epigenetic regulation. We hypothesized that exposure to cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds changes the DNA methylation levels of genes associated with depression. To test this hypothesis, we first performed a literature search to identify genes that are differentially methylated upon exposure to cannabis and cannabis-derived compounds, as reported in methylome-wide association studies. We next checked whether genes residing in loci associated with depression, as identified in the largest currently available genome-wide association study of depression, were reported to be epigenetically regulated by cannabis or cannabis-related compounds. Multiple genes residing in loci associated with depression were found to be epigenetically regulated by exposure to cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds. This epigenomic regulation of depression-associated genes by cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds was reported across diverse organisms, tissues, and developmental stages and occurred in genes crucial for neuronal development, functioning, survival, and synapse functioning, as well as in genes previously implicated in other mental disorders."
"36008758","Results and lessons from dual extraction of DNA and RNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded breast tumor tissues for a large Cancer epidemiologic study.","BMC Genomics","The use of archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissues has become a common practice in clinical and epidemiologic genetic research. Simultaneous extraction of DNA and RNA from FFPE tissues is appealing but can be practically challenging. Here we report our results and lessons learned from processing FFPE breast tumor tissues for a large epidemiologic study.Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNA FFPE kit was adapted for dual extraction using tissue punches or sections from breast tumor tissues. The yield was quantified using Qubit and fragmentation analysis by Agilent Bioanalyzer. A subset of the DNA samples were used for genome-wide DNA methylation assays and RNA samples for sequencing. The QC metrices and performance of the assays were analyzed with pre-analytical variables.A total of 1859 FFPE breast tumor tissues were processed. We found it critical to adjust proteinase K digestion time based on tissue volume to achieve balanced yields of DNA and RNA. Tissue punches taken from tumor-enriched regions provided the most reliable output. A median of 1475 ng DNA and 1786 ng RNA per sample was generated. The median DNA integrity number (DIN) was 3.8 and median DV200 for RNA was 33.2. Of 1294 DNA samples used in DNA methylation assays, 97% passed quality check by qPCR and 92% generated data deemed high quality. Of the 130 RNA samples with DV200 ≥ 20% used in RNA-sequencing, all but 5 generated usable transcriptomic data with a mapping rate ≥ 60%.Dual DNA/RNA purification using Qiagen AllPrep FFPE extraction protocol is feasible for clinical and epidemiologic studies. We recommend tissue punches as a reliable source material and fine tuning of proteinase K digestion time based on tissue volume.Our protocol and recommendations may be adapted by future studies for successful extraction of archived tumor tissues.© 2022.

"36005827","Long Non-Coding RNAs: The New Frontier into Understanding the Etiology of Alcohol Use Disorder.","Noncoding RNA","Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a complex, chronic, debilitating condition impacting millions worldwide. Genetic, environmental, and epigenetic factors are known to contribute to the development of AUD. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of regulatory RNAs, commonly referred to as the ""dark matter"" of the genome, with little to no protein-coding potential. LncRNAs have been implicated in numerous processes critical for cell survival, suggesting that they play important functional roles in regulating different cell processes. LncRNAs were also shown to display higher tissue specificity than protein-coding genes and have a higher abundance in the brain and central nervous system, demonstrating a possible role in the etiology of psychiatric disorders. Indeed, genetic (e.g., genome-wide association studies (GWAS)), molecular (e.g., expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL)) and epigenetic studies from postmortem brain tissues have identified a growing list of lncRNAs associated with neuropsychiatric and substance use disorders. Given that the expression patterns of lncRNAs have been associated with widespread changes in the transcriptome, including methylation, chromatin architecture, and activation or suppression of translational activity, the regulatory nature of lncRNAs may be ubiquitous and an innate component of gene regulation. In this review, we present a synopsis of the functional impact that lncRNAs may play in the etiology of AUD. We also discuss the classifications of lncRNAs, their known functional roles, and therapeutic advancements in the field of lncRNAs to further clarify the functional relationship between lncRNAs and AUD."

"35999641","DNA methylation analysis of normal colon organoids from familial adenomatous polyposis patients reveals novel insight into colon cancer development.","Clin Epigenetics","Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an inherited colorectal cancer (CRC) syndrome resulting from germ line mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. While FAP accounts for less than 1% of all CRC cases, loss of APC expression is seen in > 80% of non-hereditary CRCs. To better understand molecular mechanisms underlying APC-driven CRC, we performed an epigenome-wide analysis of colon organoids derived from normal-appearing colons of FAP patients versus healthy subjects to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that may precede the onset of CRC.We identified 358 DMRs when comparing colon organoids of FAP patients to those of healthy subjects (FDR < 0.05, |mean beta difference| = 5%). Of these, nearly 50% of DMRs were also differentially methylated in at least one of three CRC tumor and normal adjacent tissue (NAT) cohorts (TCGA-COAD, GSE193535 and ColoCare). Moreover, 27 of the DMRs mapped to CRC genome-wide association study (GWAS) loci. We provide evidence suggesting that some of these DMRs led to significant differences in gene expression of adjacent genes using quantitative PCR. For example, we identified significantly greater expression of five genes: Kazal-type serine peptidase inhibitor domain 1 (KAZALD1, P = 0.032), F-Box and leucine-rich repeat protein 8 (FBXL8, P = 0.036), TRIM31 antisense RNA 1 (TRIM31-AS1, P = 0.036), Fas apoptotic inhibitory molecule 2 (FAIM2, P = 0.049) and (Collagen beta (1-0)galactosyltransferase 2 (COLGALT2, P = 0.049). Importantly, both FBXL8 and TRIM31-AS1 were also significantly differentially expressed in TCGA-COAD tumor versus matched NAT, supporting a role for these genes in CRC tumor development.We performed the first DNA methylome-wide analysis of normal colon organoids derived from FAP patients compared to those of healthy subjects. Our results reveal that normal colon organoids from FAP patients exhibit extensive epigenetic differences compared to those of healthy subjects that appear similar to those exhibited in CRC tumor. Our analyses therefore identify DMRs and candidate target genes that are potentially important in CRC tumor development in FAP, with potential implications for non-hereditary CRC.© 2022.

"35999456","DNA methylome and single-cell transcriptome analyses reveal CDA as a potential druggable target for ALK inhibitor-resistant lung cancer therapy.","Exp Mol Med","Acquired resistance to inhibitors of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a major clinical challenge for ALK fusion-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In the absence of secondary ALK mutations, epigenetic reprogramming is one of the main mechanisms of drug resistance, as it leads to phenotype switching that occurs during the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Although drug-induced epigenetic reprogramming is believed to alter the sensitivity of cancer cells to anticancer treatments, there is still much to learn about overcoming drug resistance. In this study, we used an in vitro model of ceritinib-resistant NSCLC and employed genome-wide DNA methylation analysis in combination with single-cell (sc) RNA-seq to identify cytidine deaminase (CDA), a pyrimidine salvage pathway enzyme, as a candidate drug target. CDA was hypomethylated and upregulated in ceritinib-resistant cells. CDA-overexpressing cells were rarely but definitively detected in the naïve cell population by scRNA-seq, and their abundance was increased in the acquired-resistance population. Knockdown of CDA had antiproliferative effects on resistant cells and reversed the EMT phenotype. Treatment with epigenome-related nucleosides such as 5-formyl-2'-deoxycytidine selectively ablated CDA-overexpressing resistant cells via accumulation of DNA damage. Collectively, our data suggest that targeting CDA metabolism using epigenome-related nucleosides represents a potential new therapeutic strategy for overcoming ALK inhibitor resistance in NSCLC.© 2022.

Yet the competitive and cooperative relationships between TET1 and DNMT3A/B remain largely unknown in the human embryonic stem cells. Here, we revealed that the main DNA-binding domain of TET1 contains more positive charges by using charge reduction of amino acid alphabet, followed by DNMT3A and DNMT3B. The genome-wide binding profiles showed that TET1 prefers binding to the proximal promoters and CpG islands compared with DNMT3A/B. Moreover, the binding regions of these three transcription factors can be divided into specific and co-binding regions. And a stronger inhibitory effect of DNMT3A on TET1 demethylation was observed in co-binding regions. Furthermore, we integrated TET1 knockout data to further discuss the competitive binding patterns of TET1 and DNMT3A/B. The lack of TET1 increased the occupation of DNMT3A/B at the specific binding regions of TET1 causing focal hypermethylation. The knockout of TET1 was also accompanied by a reduction of DNMT3A/B binding in the co-binding regions, further confirming the cooperative binding function between TET1 and DNMT3A/B. In conclusion, our studies found that the competitive binding of TET1 and DNMT3A/B cooperatively shapes the global DNA methylation pattern in human embryonic stem cells.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

However, a comprehensive summary and meta-analysis of peripheral blood leukocyte (PBL) DNA methylation studies has thus far not been conducted. Here, we systematically reviewed all available literature up to February 2022 and summarized the observations by means of meta-analysis.We conducted a systematic search and critical appraisal of IBD-associated DNA methylation studies in PBL using the biomarker-based cross-sectional studies (BIOCROSS) tool. Subsequently, we performed meta-analyses on the summary statistics obtained from epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) that included patients with Crohn's Disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and/or healthy controls (HC).Altogether, we included 15 studies for systematic review. Critical appraisal revealed large methodological and outcome heterogeneity between studies. Summary statistics were obtained from 4 studies based on a cumulative 552 samples (177 CD, 132 UC and 243 HC). Consistent differential methylation was identified for 256 differentially methylated probes (DMPs; Bonferroni-adjusted p-value ≤0.05) when comparing CD with HC and 103 when comparing UC with HC. Comparing IBD (CD + UC) with HC resulted in 224 DMPs. Importantly, several of the previously identified DMPs, such as VMP1/TMEM49/MIR21 and RPS6KA2, were consistently differentially methylated across all studies.Methodological homogenization of IBD epigenetic studies is needed to allow for easier aggregation and independent validation. Nonetheless, we were capable of confirming previous observations. Our results can serve as the basis for future IBD epigenetic biomarker research in PBL.© The Author(s) 2022.

Nevertheless, the applications of ctDNA to the early detection and screening of cancer remain highly challenging due to the scarcity of cancer cell-specific ctDNA, the low signal-to-noise ratio of DNA variation, and the lack of non-locus-specific DNA methylation technologies.We enrolled three cohorts of breast cancer (BC) patients from two hospitals in China (BC: n = 123; healthy controls: n = 40). We developed a ctDNA whole-genome bisulfite sequencing technology employing robust trace ctDNA capture from up to 200 μL plasma, mini-input (1 ng) library preparation, unbiased genome-wide coverage and comprehensive computational methods.A diagnostic signature comprising 15 ctDNA methylation markers exhibited high accuracy in the early (area under the curve [AUC] of 0.967) and advanced (AUC of 0.971) BC stages in multicentre patient cohorts. Furthermore, we revealed a ctDNA methylation signature that discriminates estrogen receptor status (Training set: AUC of 0.984 and Test set: AUC of 0.780). Different cancer types, including hepatocellular carcinoma and lung cancer, could also be well distinguished.Our study provides a toolset to generate unbiased whole-genome ctDNA methylomes with a minimal amount of plasma to develop highly specific and sensitive biomarkers for the early diagnosis and molecular subtyping of cancer.© 2022 The Authors.

"35997618","Genome-wide DNA methylation patterns harbor signatures of hatchling sex and past incubation temperature in a species with environmental sex determination.","Mol Ecol","Conservation of thermally sensitive species depends on monitoring organismal and population-level responses to environmental change in real time. Epigenetic processes are increasingly recognized as key integrators of environmental conditions into developmentally plastic responses, and attendant epigenomic datasets hold potential for revealing cryptic phenotypes relevant to conservation efforts. Here, we demonstrate the utility of genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns in the face of climate change for a group of especially vulnerable species, those with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). Due to their reliance on thermal cues during development to determine sexual fate, contemporary shifts in temperature are predicted to skew offspring sex ratios and ultimately destabilize sensitive populations. Using reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing, we profiled the DNA methylome in blood cells of hatchling American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), a TSD species lacking reliable markers of sexual dimorphism in early life-stages. We identified 120 sex-associated differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs; FDR < 0.1) in hatchlings incubated under a range of temperatures, as well as 707 unique temperature-associated DMCs. We further developed DNAm-based models capable of predicting hatchling sex with 100% accuracy (in 20 training samples and 4 test samples) and past incubation temperature with a mean absolute error of 1.2°C (in 4 test samples) based on the methylation status of 20 and 24 loci, respectively. Though largely independent of epigenomic patterning occurring in the embryonic gonad during TSD, DNAm patterns in blood cells may serve as non-lethal markers of hatchling sex and past incubation conditions in conservation applications. These findings also raise intriguing questions regarding tissue-specific epigenomic patterning in the context of developmental plasticity.Copyright © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

To explore the role of DNA methylation changes in PD and DLB pathogenesis, we performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of 322 postmortem frontal cortex samples and replicated results in an independent set of 200 donors. We report novel differentially methylated replicating loci associated with Braak Lewy body stage near TMCC2, SFMBT2, AKAP6 and PHYHIP. Differentially methylated probes were independent of known PD genetic risk alleles. Meta-analysis provided suggestive evidence for a differentially methylated locus within the chromosomal region affected by the PD-associated 22q11.2 deletion. Our findings elucidate novel disease pathways in PD and DLB and generate hypotheses for future molecular studies of Lewy body pathology.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35995261","Regulation of DNA methylation during the testicular development of Shaziling pigs.","Genomics","DNA methylation is one of the key epigenetic regulatory mechanisms in development and spermatogenesis. However, the dynamic regulatory mechanisms of genome-wide DNA methylation during testicular development remain largely unknown. Herein, we generated a single-base resolution DNA methylome and transcriptome atlas of precocious porcine testicular tissues across three developmental stages (1, 75, and 150 days old). The results showed that the dynamic methylation patterns were directly related to the expression of the DNMT3A gene. Conjoint analysis revealed a negative regulatory pattern between promoter methylation and the positive regulation of 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) methylation. Mechanistically, the decrease in promoter methylation affected the upregulation of meiosis-related genes, such as HORMAD1, SPO11, and SYCE1. Demethylation in the 3'UTR induced the downregulation of the INHBA gene and knockdown of INHBA inhibited cell proliferation by reducing the synthesis of activin A. These findings contribute to exploring the regulatory mechanisms of DNA methylation in testicular development.Copyright © 2022. Published by Elsevier Inc."

We assessed if molecular risk factors in atopic mothers influence their infants' susceptibility to an atopic disease.Pregnant women and their infants with (n=174, high-risk) or without (n=126, low-risk) parental atopy were enrolled in a prospective birth cohort. Global differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were determined in atopic (n=92) and non-atopic (n=82) mothers. Principal component analysis was used to predict atopy risk in children dependent on maternal atopy. Genome-wide transcriptomic analyses were performed in paired atopic (n=20) and non-atopic (n=15) mothers and cord blood. Integrative genomic analyses were conducted to define methylation-gene expression relationships.AD was more prevalent in high-risk compared to low-risk children by age 2. Differential methylation analyses identified 165 DMRs distinguishing atopic from non-atopic mothers. Inclusion of DMRs in addition to maternal atopy significantly increased the odds ratio to develop AD in children from 2.56 to 4.26. In atopic compared to non-atopic mothers, 139 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified significantly enriched of genes within the interferon signaling pathway. Expression quantitative trait methylation analyses dependent on maternal atopy identified 29 DEGs controlled by 136 trans-acting methylation marks, some located near transcription factors. Differential expression for the same 9 genes, including MX1 and IFI6 within the interferon pathway, was identified in atopic and non-atopic mothers and high-risk and low-risk children.These data suggest that in utero epigenetic and transcriptomic mechanisms predominantly involving the interferon pathway may impact and predict the development of infant atopy.This article is protected by copyright.

"35993304","Gestational diabetes mellitus placentas exhibit epimutations at placental development genes.","Epigenetics","Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a maternal metabolic disorder that perturbs placental development and increases the risk of offspring short- and long-term metabolic disorders. The mechanisms by which GDM impairs placental development remain poorly understood. Here, we defined the DNA methylome of GDM placentas and determined whether GDM perturbs methylation at genes important for placental development. We conducted an epigenome-wide association study of 42 placentas from pregnancies in the South African Soweto First 1000 days cohort (S1000). Using genome-wide bisulfite sequencing, we compared non-GDM placentas to GDM placentas with similar proportions from obese and non-obese mothers. Compared to non-GDM, GDM placentas exhibited a distinct methylation profile consisting of 12,210 differentially methylated CpGs (DMCs) that mapped to 3,875 genes. Epigenetically altered genes were enriched in Wnt and cadherin signalling pathways, both critical in placentation and embryogenesis. We also defined regional DNA methylation perturbation in GDM placentas at 11 placental development genes. These findings reveal extensive changes to the placental epigenome of GDM pregnancies and highlight perturbation enriched at important placental development genes. These molecular changes represent potential mechanisms for GDM-induced placental effects that may serve as candidate biomarkers for placental, maternal, and foetal health. Using a study design that used similar proportions of obese and non-obese mothers in our case and control pregnancies, we minimized the detection of changes due to obesity alone. Further work will be necessary to investigate the extent of the influence of obesity on these GDM-related placental epigenetic changes."
"35991567","Identification of aberrantly methylated differentially expressed genes and pro-tumorigenic role of KIF2C in melanoma.","Front Genet","Background:Skin Cutaneous Melanoma (SKCM) is known as an aggressive malignant cancer, which could be directly derived from melanocytic nevi. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the malignant transformation of melanocytes and melanoma tumor progression still remain unclear. Increasing research showed significant roles of epigenetic modifications, especially DNA methylation, in melanoma. This study focused on the identification and analysis of methylation-regulated differentially expressed genes (MeDEGs) between melanocytic nevus and malignant melanoma in genome-wide profiles.Methods:The gene expression profiling datasets (GSE3189 and GSE114445) and gene methylation profiling datasets (GSE86355 and GSE120878) were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially methylated genes (DMGs) were identified via GEO2R. MeDEGs were obtained by integrating the DEGs and DMGs. Then, a functional enrichment analysis of MeDEGs was performed. STRING and Cytoscape were used to describe the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Furthermore, survival analysis was implemented to select the prognostic hub genes. Next, we conducted gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of hub genes. To validate, SKCM cell culture and lentivirus infection was performed to reveal the expression and behavior pattern of KIF2C. Patients and specimens were collected and then immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining was conducted.Results:We identified 237 hypomethylated, upregulated genes and 182 hypermethylated, downregulated genes. Hypomethylation-upregulated genes were enriched in biological processes of the oxidation-reduction process, cell proliferation, cell division, phosphorylation, extracellular matrix disassembly and protein sumoylation. Pathway enrichment showed selenocompound metabolism, small cell lung cancer and lysosome. Hypermethylation-downregulated genes were enriched in biological processes of positive regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter, cell adhesion, cell proliferation, positive regulation of transcription, DNA-templated and angiogenesis. The most significantly enriched pathways involved the transcriptional misregulation in cancer, circadian rhythm, tight junction, protein digestion and absorption and Hippo signaling pathway. After PPI establishment and survival analysis, seven prognostic hub genes were CKS2, DTL, KIF2C, KPNA2, MYBL2, TPX2, and FBL. Moreover, the most involved hallmarks obtained by GSEA were E2F targets, G2M checkpoint and mitotic spindle. Importantly, among the 7 hub genes, we found that down-regulated level of KIF2C expression significantly inhibited the proliferative ability of SKCM cells and suppressed the metastasis capacity of SKCM cells.Conclusions:Our study identified potential aberrantly methylated-differentially expressed genes participating in the process of malignant transformation from nevus to melanoma tissues based on comprehensive genomic profiles. Transcription profiles of CKS2, DTL, KIF2C, KPNA2, MYBL2, TPX2, and FBL provided clues of aberrantly methylation-based biomarkers, which might improve the development of precision medicine. KIF2C plays a pro-tumorigenic role and potentially inhibited the proliferative ability in SKCM.Copyright © 2022 Huang, Han, Wu and Shen."
"35989709","Large-Scale Hypothesis Testing for Causal Mediation Effects with Applications in Genome-wide Epigenetic Studies.","J Am Stat Assoc","In genome-wide epigenetic studies, it is of great scientific interest to assess whether the effect of an exposure on a clinical outcome is mediated through DNA methylations. However, statistical inference for causal mediation effects is challenged by the fact that one needs to test a large number of composite null hypotheses across the whole epigenome. Two popular tests, the Wald-type Sobel's test and the joint significant test using the traditional null distribution are underpowered and thus can miss important scientific discoveries. In this paper, we show that the null distribution of Sobel's test is not the standard normal distribution and the null distribution of the joint significant test is not uniform under the composite null of no mediation effect, especially in finite samples and under the singular point null case that the exposure has no effect on the mediator and the mediator has no effect on the outcome. Our results explain why these two tests are underpowered, and more importantly motivate us to develop a more powerful Divide-Aggregate Composite-null Test (DACT) for the composite null hypothesis of no mediation effect by leveraging epigenome-wide data. We adopted Efron's empirical null framework for assessing statistical significance of the DACT test. We showed analytically that the proposed DACT method had improved power, and could well control type I error rate. Our extensive simulation studies showed that, in finite samples, the DACT method properly controlled the type I error rate and outperformed Sobel's test and the joint significance test for detecting mediation effects. We applied the DACT method to the US Department of Veterans Affairs Normative Aging Study, an ongoing prospective cohort study which included men who were aged 21 to 80 years at entry. We identified multiple DNA methylation CpG sites that might mediate the effect of smoking on lung function with effect sizes ranging from -0.18 to -0.79 and false discovery rate controlled at level 0.05, including the CpG sites in the genes AHRR and F2RL3. Our sensitivity analysis found small residual correlations (less than 0.01) of the error terms between the outcome and mediator regressions, suggesting that our results are robust to unmeasured confounding factors."
"35988784","Epigenetic regulation of fetal brain development in pig.","Gene","How fetal brain development is regulated at the molecular level is not well understood. Due to ethical challenges associated with research on the human fetus, large animals particularly pigs are increasingly used to study development and disorders of fetal brain. The pig fetal brain grows rapidly during the last ∼ 50 days before birth which is around day 60 (d60) of pig gestation. But what regulates the onset of accelerated growth of the brain is unknown. The current study tests the hypothesis that epigenetic alteration around d60 is involved in the onset of rapid growth of fetal brain of pig. To test this hypothesis, DNA methylation changes of fetal brain was assessed in a genome-wide manner by Enzymatic Methyl-seq (EM-seq) during two gestational periods (GP): d45 vs. d60 (GP1) and d60 vs. d90 (GP2). The cytosine-guanine (CpG) methylation data was analyzed in an integrative manner with the RNA-seq data generated from the same brain samples from our earlier study. A neural network based modeling approach was implemented to learn changes in methylation patterns of the differentially expressed genes, and then predict methylations of the brain in a genome-wide manner during rapid growth. This approach identified specific methylations that changed in a mutually informative manner during rapid growth of the fetal brain. These methylations were significantly overrepresented in specific genic as well as intergenic features including CpG islands, introns, and untranslated regions. In addition, sex-bias methylations of known single nucleotide polymorphic sites were also identified in the fetal brain ide during rapid growth.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"35988507","DNA methylome of primary spermatocyte reveals epigenetic dysregulation associated with male sterility of cattleyak.","Theriogenology","DNA cytosine methylation modification in the germline is of particular importance since it is a highly heritable epigenetic mark. Although cytosine methylation has been analyzed at the genome-scale for several mammalian species, our knowledge of DNA methylation patterns and the mechanisms underlying male hybrid sterility is still limited in domestic animals such as cattleyak. Here we for the first time show the genome-wide and single-base resolution landscape of methylcytosines (mC) in the primary spermatocyte (PSC) genome of yak with normal spermatogenesis and the inter-specific hybrid cattleyak with male infertility. A comparative investigation revealed that widespread differences are observed in the composition and patterning of DNA cytosine methylation between the two methylomes. Global CG or non-CG DNA methylation levels, as well as the number of mC sites, are increased in cattleyak compared to yak. Notably, the DNA methylome in cattleyak PSC exhibits promoter hypermethylation of meiosis-specific genes and piRNA pathway genes with respect to yak. Furthermore, major retrotransposonson classes are predominantly hypermethylated in cattleyak while those are fully hypomethylated in yak. KEGG pathway enrichment indicates Rap1 signaling and MAPK pathways may play potential roles in the spermatogenic arrest of cattleyak. Our present study not only provides valuable insights into distinct features of the cattleyak PSC methylome but also paves the way toward elucidating the complex, yet highly coordinated epigenetic modification during male germline development for inter-specific hybrid animals.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

By studying the epigenetic profile in pre-diagnostic blood samples of melanoma cases and cancer free controls, we aimed to identify DNA methylation sites conferring melanoma risk. DNA methylation was measured at 775,528 CpG sites using the Illumina EPIC array in whole blood in incident melanoma cases (n = 183) and matched cancer-free controls (n = 183) in the Norwegian Women and Cancer cohort. Phenotypic information and ultraviolet radiation exposure were obtained from questionnaires. Epigenome wide association (EWAS) was analyzed in future melanoma cases and controls with conditional logistic regression, with correction for multiple testing using the false discovery rate (FDR). We extended the analysis by including a public data set on melanoma (GSE120878), and combining these different data sets using a version of covariate modulated FDR (AdaPT). The analysis on future melanoma cases and controls did not identify any genome wide significant CpG sites (0.85 ≤ padj ≤ 0.99). In the restricted AdaPT analysis, 7 CpG sites were suggestive at the FDR level of 0.15. These CpG sites may potentially be used as pre-diagnostic biomarkers of melanoma risk.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35987687","Schizophrenia-associated differential DNA methylation in brain is distributed across the genome and annotated to MAD1L1, a locus at which DNA methylation and transcription phenotypes share genetic variation with schizophrenia risk.","Transl Psychiatry","DNA methylation (DNAm), the addition of a methyl group to a cytosine in DNA, plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with schizophrenia (SZ) by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) often influence local DNAm levels. Thus, DNAm alterations, acting through effects on gene expression, represent one potential mechanism by which SZ-associated SNPs confer risk. In this study, we investigated genome-wide DNAm in postmortem superior temporal gyrus from 44 subjects with SZ and 44 non-psychiatric comparison subjects using Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip microarrays, and extracted cell-type-specific methylation signals by applying tensor composition analysis. We identified SZ-associated differential methylation at 242 sites, and 44 regions containing two or more sites (FDR cutoff of q = 0.1) and determined a subset of these were cell-type specific. We found mitotic arrest deficient 1-like 1 (MAD1L1), a gene within an established GWAS risk locus, harbored robust SZ-associated differential methylation. We investigated the potential role of MAD1L1 DNAm in conferring SZ risk by assessing for colocalization among quantitative trait loci for methylation and gene transcripts (mQTLs and tQTLs) in brain tissue and GWAS signal at the locus using multiple-trait-colocalization analysis. We found that mQTLs and tQTLs colocalized with the GWAS signal (posterior probability >0.8). Our findings suggest that alterations in MAD1L1 methylation and transcription may mediate risk for SZ at the MAD1L1-containing locus. Future studies to identify how SZ-associated differential methylation affects MAD1L1 biological function are indicated.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35986497","The landscape of Chlamydomonas histone H3 lysine 4 methylation reveals both constant features and dynamic changes during the diurnal cycle.","Plant J","Chromatin modifications are epigenetic regulatory features with major roles in various cellular events, yet they remain understudied in algae. We interrogated the genome wide distribution pattern of mono- and trimethylated H3K4 using chromatin-immunoprecipitation followed by deep-sequencing (ChIP-Seq) during key phases of the Chlamydomonas cell cycle: early G1phase (Zeitgeber Time 1, ZT1) when cells initiate biomass accumulation, S/M phase (ZT13) when cells are replicating DNA and undergoing mitosis, and late G0phase (ZT23) when they are quiescent. Tri-methylated H3K4 was predominantly enriched at TSSs of the majority of protein coding genes (85%). The likelihood of a gene being marked by H3K4me3 correlated with it being transcribed at some point during the life cycle but not necessarily by continuous active transcription, as exemplified by early zygotic genes, which may remain transcriptionally dormant for thousands of generations between sexual cycles. The exceptions to this rule were around 120 loci, some of which encode non-poly-adenylated transcripts, such as snRNAs and replication dependent histones that had H3K4me3 peaks only when they were being transcribed. Mono-methylated H3K4 was the default state for the vast majority of histones that were bound outside of transcription start sites (TSSs) and terminator regions of genes. A small fraction of the genome that was depleted of any H3 lysine 4 methylation was enriched for DNA cytosine methylation and the genes within these DNA methylation islands were poorly expressed. Besides marking protein-coding genes, H3K4me3 ChIP-Seq data served also as a annotation tool for validation of hundreds of long non-coding RNA genes.This article is protected by copyright.

Mongolia, where nomadic livestock pastoralism has been the primal livelihood, has a higher prevalence of various chronic diseases than the surrounding East Asian regions, which are more suitable for crop farming. The genes related to dietary stress and pathogenesis of related disorders may have varying epigenetic statuses among the human populations with diverse dietary cultures. Hence, to understand such epigenetic differences, we conducted a comparative analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation of Mongolians and crop-farming East Asians.Genome-wide DNA methylation status of peripheral blood cells (PBCs) from 23 Mongolian adults and 24 Thai adults was determined using the Infinium Human Methylation 450K arrays and analyzed in combination with previously published 450K data of 20 Japanese and 8 Chinese adults. CpG sites/regions differentially methylated between Mongolians and crop-farming East Asians were detected using a linear model adjusted for sex, age, ethnicity, and immune cell heterogeneity on RnBeads software.Of the quality-controlled 389,454 autosomal CpG sites, 223 CpG sites were significantly differentially methylated among Mongolians and the four crop farming East Asian populations (false discovery rate < 0.05). Analyses focused on gene promoter regions revealed that PM20D1 (peptidase M20 domain containing 1), which is involved in mitochondrial uncoupling and various processes, including cellular protection from reactive oxygen species (ROS) and thermogenesis, was the top differentially methylated gene. Moreover, gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed that biological processes related to ROS metabolism were overrepresented among the top 1% differentially methylated genes. The promoter regions of these genes were generally hypermethylated in Mongolians, suggesting that the metabolic pathway detoxifying ROS might be globally suppressed in Mongolians, resulting in the high susceptibility of this population to various chronic diseases.This study showed a significantly diverse DNA methylation status among Mongolians and crop-farming East Asians. Further, we found an association between the differentially methylated genes and various metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. Knowledge of the epigenetic regulators might help in proper understanding, treatment, and control of such disorders, and physiological adaptation in the future.© 2022. The Author(s)."

The Childhood Chronic Stress Questionnaire was used to assess stress caused by early-life events. MDD patients underwent six weeks of treatment, and response to treatment was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory-II. In addition, four MDD patients and five controls were randomly chosen for genome-wide methylation analysis.The gene RPS6KA5 showed significant methylation differences between the two groups. Severity of chronic childhood stress was significantly associated with increased risk of depression in adolescents, but not with treatment response. Baseline RPS6KA5 methylation can predict remission after six weeks of treatment. We did not observe any interaction between RPS6KA5 methylation and chronic childhood stress.Our results suggest that RPS6KA5 methylation can be used as a predictor of response to treatment in adolescent MDD patients.

"35981514","Prenatal Diagnosis and Fetal Outcome with Mosaic Genome-Wide Uniparental Disomy.","Fetal Diagn Ther","Introduction While non-mosaic genome-wide paternal uniparental disomy (patUPD) is consistent with complete hydatidiform mole, the prenatal presentation of mosaic genome-wide patUPD is not well defined. This report adds another case to the small cohort of patients with the rare genetic disorder of mosaic genome-wide patUPD and provides one of the few examples of a prenatal presentation of this disease. We discuss ultrasound findings and prenatal analysis to review predominant genetic and clinical features associated with mosaic genome-wide patUPD. Case Presentation A 30-year-old gravida 1 para 0 woman was referred at 10 weeks gestation due to an abnormal first trimester ultrasound suggesting a partial molar pregnancy. The patient undertook genetic counseling and reviewed possible genetic etiologies and testing options. Karyotype analysis demonstrated a female fetus (46, XX). The BWS methylation pattern suggested the absence of maternally derived copies of IC1 (H19) and IC2 (LIT1) critical regions, which could result from patUPD of chromosome 11. CMA of cultured amniocytes was significant for arr(1-22,X)x2 hmz, consistent with genome wide absence of heterozygosity (shown in Fig. 3). Discussion/Conclusion This case report is intended to add to the limited knowledge regarding prenatal diagnosis of mosaic genome-wide patUPD by highlighting the ultrasound findings, the genetic testing performed, and fetal outcome. The fetal karyotype was normal. CMA was consistent with a molecular diagnosis of GWUPD. Low level mosaicism in our sample was inferred given the clinical presentation of a developed fetus. Methylation studies were consistent with a diagnosis of BWS. The diagnosis of genome-wide patUPD using CMA provides further knowledge of UPD and its functional relevance. In a prenatal setting, a CMA profile without heterozygosity is typical of a complete molar pregnancy. However, in the presence of a fetus, it likely represents mosaic GWUPD, a rare condition that is usually of paternal origin.S. Karger AG, Basel."

Epigenetic regulation plays a key role in infection and inflammation. To reveal the epigenetic relationships between sCD14, immune function and disease progression among PWH, we conducted an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of sCD14 and investigated the relationship with mortality.DNA methylation (DNAm) levels of peripheral blood samples from PWH in the Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS) were measured using the Illumina Infinium Methylation 450K (n = 549) and EPIC (850K) BeadChip (n = 526). Adjusted for covariates and multiple testing, we conducted an epigenome-wide discovery, replication, and meta-analysis to identify significant associations with sCD14. We then examined and replicated the relationship between the principal epigenetic sites and survival using Cox regression models.We identified 118 DNAm sites significantly associated with sCD14 in the meta-analysis of 1075 PWH. The principal associated DNAm sites mapped to genes (e.g. STAT1, PARP9, IFITM1, MX1, and IFIT1) related to inflammation and antiviral response. Adjusting for multiple testing, 10 of 118 sCD14-associated DNAm sites significantly predicted survival time conditional on sCD14 levels.The identification of DNAm sites independently predicting survival may improve our understanding of prognosis and potential therapeutic targets among PWH.Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

It is proposed that early nutrition may affect neurodevelopmental pathways by altering gene expression through epigenetic modification. Variation in DNA methylation (DNAm) at cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpGs) is a commonly studied epigenetic modification.To assess whether early MM intake by VLBW infants is associated with variations in DNAm at 5.5 years, and whether these variations correlate with neurodevelopmental phenotypes.This cohort study was a 5.5-year follow-up (2016-2018) of VLBW infants born in Ontario, Canada who participated in the Donor Milk for Improved Neurodevelopmental Outcomes trial. We performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) to test whether % MM (not including supplemental donor milk) during hospitalization was associated with DNAm in buccal cells during early childhood (5.7 ± 0.2 years, n = 143; birth weight of 1008 ± 517 grams). DNAm was assessed with the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC array at 814,583 CpGs. In secondary analyses, we tested associations between top-ranked CpGs and measures of early childhood neurodevelopment, e.g., total surface area of the cerebral cortex (n = 41, magnetic resonance imaging) and Full-Scale IQ (n = 133, Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-IV).EWAS analysis demonstrated % MM intake by VLBW infants during hospitalization was associated with DNAm at 2 CpGs, cg03744440 (MYO15B) and cg00851389 (MT1A) at 5.5 years (P < 9E-08). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis indicated that top-ranked CpGs (P < 0.001) were annotated to genes enriched in neurodevelopmental biological processes. Corroborating these findings, DNAm at several top identified CpGs from EWAS was associated with cortical surface area and IQ at 5.5 years (P < 0.05).In-hospital % MM intake by VLBW infants was associated with variations in DNAm of neurodevelopmental genes at 5.5 years; some of these DNAm variations are associated with brain structure and IQ.

We included 577 studies focused on genome-wide and epigenome-wide associations, candidate genes (SNP and methylation), noncoding RNAs, and histones. Convergence of specific genes is limited across units of analysis, although pathway-based analyses do indicate nervous system development and function and immunity/inflammation as potential underlying mechanisms of SITB.

Its pathogenic mechanisms have not yet been fully understood. To investigate the mechanism in the pathogenesis of PHPT, the transcriptome and genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of parathyroid adenoma were analyzed. The candidate genes that may be involved in the PHPT were verified via qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, western blot, and methylation-specific PCR. A total of 1650 differentially expressed genes and 2373 differentially methylated regions were identified. After the integration of its transcriptome and DNA methylation data, IL6, SYP, GNA01, and pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) were the candidate genes that demonstrated a similar pattern between their mRNA expression and DNA methylation status. Of the 4 candidate genes, POMC, a pro-peptide which is processed to a range of bioactive peptide products like ACTH, was further confirmed to be expressed at low levels at both the mRNA and protein levels, which may be due to POMC promoter hypermethylation. Hypermethylation of the POMC promoter may contribute to its low expression, which may be involved in the pathogenesis of PHPT.© 2022. The Author(s)."

To interrogate the roles of epigenetic modifiers in cancer cells, we generated an epigenome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout library (EPIKOL) that targets a wide-range of epigenetic modifiers and their cofactors. We conducted eight screens in two different cancer types and showed that EPIKOL performs with high efficiency in terms of sgRNA distribution and depletion of essential genes. We discovered novel epigenetic modifiers that regulate triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and prostate cancer cell fitness. We confirmed the growth-regulatory functions of individual candidates, including SS18L2 and members of the NSL complex (KANSL2, KANSL3, KAT8) in TNBC cells. Overall, we show that EPIKOL, a focused sgRNA library targeting ~800 genes, can reveal epigenetic modifiers that are essential for cancer cell fitness under in vitro and in vivo conditions and enable the identification of novel anti-cancer targets. Due to its comprehensive epigenome-wide targets and relatively high number of sgRNAs per gene, EPIKOL will facilitate studies examining functional roles of epigenetic modifiers in a wide range of contexts, such as screens in primary cells, patient-derived xenografts as well as in vivo models.© 2022.

The association of each EAA marker was tested with VACS Index 2.0. All-cause mortality was assessed over 10-years. For each EAA marker, the hazard ratio (HR) per increased year was determined using Cox regression. To evaluate mortality discrimination, C-statistics were derived.Participants were mostly men (98.5%) with mean (SD) age of 52.4 (7.8) years and non-Hispanic black (84.4%). VACS Index mean (SD) score was 59.3 (16.4) and 136 deaths occurred over a median follow-up of 8.7 years. Grim age acceleration (GrimAA), Pheno AA, Hannum AA, and extrinsic epigenetic AA were associated with the VACS Index and mortality. Horvath AA and intrinsic epigenetic AA were not associated with either outcome. GrimAA had the greatest mortality discrimination among EAA markers and predicted mortality independently of the VACS Index. One-year increase in GrimAA was associated with a one-point increase in VACS Index and a 10% increased hazard for mortality.The observed associations between EAA markers with physiologic frailty and mortality support future research to provide mechanistic insight into the accelerated aging process and inform interventions tailored to PWH for promoting increased healthspan.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Infectious Diseases Society of America 2022."
"35969790","Deep learning predicts DNA methylation regulatory variants in the human brain and elucidates the genetics of psychiatric disorders.","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","There is growing evidence for the role of DNA methylation (DNAm) quantitative trait loci (mQTLs) in the genetics of complex traits, including psychiatric disorders. However, due to extensive linkage disequilibrium (LD) of the genome, it is challenging to identify causal genetic variations that drive DNAm levels by population-based genetic association studies. This limits the utility of mQTLs for fine-mapping risk loci underlying psychiatric disorders identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here we present INTERACT, a deep learning model that integrates convolutional neural networks with transformer, to predict effects of genetic variations on DNAm levels at CpG sites in the human brain. We show that INTERACT-derived DNAm regulatory variants are not confounded by LD, are concentrated in regulatory genomic regions in the human brain, and are convergent with mQTL evidence from genetic association analysis. We further demonstrate that predicted DNAm regulatory variants are enriched for heritability of brain-related traits and improve polygenic risk prediction for schizophrenia across diverse ancestry samples. Finally, we applied predicted DNAm regulatory variants for fine-mapping schizophrenia GWAS risk loci to identify potential novel risk genes. Our study shows the power of a deep learning approach to identify functional regulatory variants that may elucidate the genetic basis of complex traits."

This study investigates a comprehensive characterization of the entire DNA methylation (DNAm) landscape of BLCA to determine the relevant biomarkers for the non-invasive diagnosis of BLCA.A total of 304 samples from 224 donors were enrolled in this multi-centre, prospective cohort study. BLCA-specific DNAm signature discovery was carried out with genome-wide bisulfite sequencing in 32 tumour tissues and 12 normal urine samples. A targeted sequencing assay for BLCA-specific DNAm signatures was developed to categorize tumour tissue against normal urine, or MIBC against NMIBC. Independent validation was performed with targeted sequencing of 259 urine samples in a double-blinded manner to determine the clinical diagnosis and prognosis value of DNAm-based classification models. Functions of genomic region harbouring BLCA-specific DNAm signature were validated with biological assays. Concordances of pathology to urine tumour DNA (circulating tumour DNA [ctDNA]) methylation, genomic mutations or other state-of-the-art diagnosis methods were measured.Genome-wide DNAm profile could accurately classify LG tumour from HG tumour (LG NMIBC vs. HG NMIBC: p = .038; LG NMIBC vs. HG MIBC, p = .00032; HG NMIBC vs. HG MIBC: p = .82; Student's t-test). Overall, the DNAm profile distinguishes MIBC from NMIBC and normal urine. Targeted-sequencing-based DNAm signature classifiers accurately classify LG NMIBC tissues from HG MIBC and could detect tumours in urine at a limit of detection of less than .5%. In tumour tissues, DNAm accurately classifies pathology, thus outperforming genomic mutation or RNA expression profiles. In the independent validation cohort, pre-surgery urine ctDNA methylation outperforms fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay to detect HG BLCA (n = 54) with 100% sensitivity (95% CI: 82.5%-100%) and LG BLCA (n = 26) with 62% sensitivity (95% CI: 51.3%-72.7%), both at 100% specificity (non-BLCA: n = 72; 95% CI: 84.1%-100%). Pre-surgery urine ctDNA methylation signature correlates with pathology and predicts recurrence and metastasis. Post-surgery urine ctDNA methylation (n = 61) accurately predicts recurrence-free survival within 180 days, with 100% accuracy.With the discovery of BLCA-specific DNAm signatures, targeted sequencing of ctDNA methylation outperforms FISH and DNA mutation to detect tumours, predict recurrence and make prognoses.© 2022 The Authors.

The average CR in the treatment group through 24-months of follow-up was 12%. Whole blood (baseline, 12 and 24 month) DNAm profiles were measured. Epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) analysis tested CR-induced changes from baseline to 12- and 24-months in the n=197 participants with available DNAm data.CR treatment was not associated with epigenome-wide significant (FDR<0.05) DNAm changes at the individual-CpG-site level. Secondary analysis of sets of CpG sites identified in published EWAS revealed that CR induced DNAm changes opposite to those associated with higher body mass index and cigarette smoking (p<0.003 at 12- and 24-month follow-ups). In contrast, CR altered DNAm at chronological-age associated CpG sites in the direction of older age (p<0.003 at 12- and 24-month follow-ups).Although individual CpG site DNAm changes in response to CR were not identified, analyses of sets CpGs identified in prior EWAS revealed CR-induced changes to blood DNAm. Altered CpG sets were enriched for insulin-production, glucose-tolerance, inflammation, and DNA-binding and -regulation pathways, several of which are known to be modified by CR. DNAm changes may contribute to CR effects on aging.© The Author(s) 2022. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Gerontological Society of America."
"35963411","Traffic-related air pollution and genome-wide DNA methylation: A randomized, crossover trial.","Sci Total Environ","Traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) has been associated with changes in gene-specific DNA methylation. However, few studies have investigated impact of TRAP exposure on genome-wide DNA methylation in circulating blood of human.To explore the association between TRAP exposure and genome-wide DNA methylation.We conducted a randomized, crossover exposure trial among 35 healthy adults in Shanghai, China. All subjects were randomly allocated to a traffic-free park or a main road for consecutive 4 h, respectively. Blood genome-wide DNA methylation after each exposure session was measured by the Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip (850K). The differentially methylated CpGs loci associated with TRAP exposure were identified using linear mixed-effect model.The average concentrations of traffic-related air pollutants including black carbon, ultrafine particles, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide were 2-3 times higher in the road compared to those in the park. Methylation levels of 68 CpG loci were significantly changed (false discovery rate < 0.05) following TRAP exposure, among which 49 were hypermethylated and 19 were hypomethylated. The annotated genes based on the differential CpGs loci were related to pathways in cardiovascular signaling, cytokine signaling, immune response, nervous system signaling, and metabolism.We found that TRAP exposure was associated with DNA methylation in dozens of genes concerning cardiometabolic health. This trial for the first-time profiled genome-wide methylation changes induced by TRAP exposure using the 850K assay, providing epigenetic insights in understanding the cardiometabolic effects of TRAP exposure.Copyright © 2022.

"35961279","The evolution and function of transposons in epigenetic regulation in response to the environment.","Curr Opin Plant Biol","Transposable elements (TEs) make up a major proportion of plant genomes. Despite their prevalence genome-wide, TEs are often tossed aside as ""junk DNA"" since they rarely cause phenotypes, and epigenetic mechanisms silence TEs to prevent them from causing deleterious mutations through movement. While this bleak picture of TEs in genomes is true on average, a growing number of examples across many plant species point to TEs as drivers of phenotypic diversity and novel stress responses. Examples of TE-influenced phenotypes illustrate the many ways that novel transposition events can alter local gene expression and how this relates to potential variation in plant responses to environmental stress. Since TE families and insertions at the locus level lack evolutionary conservation, advancements in the field will require TE experts across diverse species to identify and utilize TE variation in their own systems as a means of crop improvement.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

However, due to low coverage of the Illumina platform, many important CpGs might have been missed.In a large collection of human brain tissue samples (N = 864), we fine-mapped previous EWAS loci by targeted bisulfite sequencing and examined their associations with AD neuropathology. DNA methylation was also linked to gene expression of the same brain cortex.Our targeted sequencing captured 130 CpGs (∼1.2 kb), 93 of which are novel. Of the 130 CpGs, 57 sites (only 17 included in previous EWAS) and 12 gene regions (e.g., ANK1, BIN1, RHBDF2, SPG7, PODXL) were significantly associated with amyloid load.

Molecularly crowded solutions and monovalent cations have been reported to stabilize in vitro and in vivo G4 formation. However, how K+and Na+affect G4 formation genome-wide is still unclear in plants. Here, we conducted BG4-DNA-IP-seq, DNA immunoprecipitation with anti-BG4 antibody coupled with sequencing, under K+and Na++ PEG conditions in vitro. We found that K+-specific IP-G4s had a longer peak size, more GC and PQS content, and distinct AT and GC skews compared to Na+-specific IP-G4s. Moreover, K+- and Na+-specific IP-G4s exhibited differential subgenomic enrichment and distinct putative functional motifs for the binding of certain trans-factors. More importantly, we found that K+-specific IP-G4s were more associated with active marks, such as active histone marks, and low DNA methylation levels, as compared to Na+-specific IP-G4s; thus, K+-specific IP-G4s in combination with active chromatin features facilitate the expression of overlapping genes. In addition, K+- and Na+-specific IP-G4 overlapping genes exhibited differential GO (gene ontology) terms, suggesting they may have distinct biological relevance in rice. Thus, our study, for the first time, explores the effects of K+and Na+on global G4 formation in vitro, thereby providing valuable resources for functional G4 studies in rice. It will provide certain G4 loci for the biotechnological engineering of rice in the future."

Through a comparison of RNA-Seq data between the control and the high temperature treated lettuces at different time points totally identified 2944 up-regulated genes and 2203 down-regulated genes, which cover three floral pathways including photoperiod, age and gibberellin (GA) pathways.

Our previous characterizations of Arabidopsis H3K4 demethylases suggest roles for H3K4me1 in transcription. However, the control of H3K4me1 remains unexplored in Arabidopsis, in which no methyltransferase for H3K4me1 has been identified. Here, we identify three Arabidopsis methyltransferases that direct H3K4me1. Analyses of their genome-wide localization using ChIP-seq and machine learning reveal that one of the enzymes cooperates with the transcription machinery, while the other two are associated with specific histone modifications and DNA sequences. Importantly, these two types of localization patterns are also found for the other H3K4 methyltransferases in Arabidopsis and mice. These results suggest that H3K4me1/2/3 are established and maintained via interplay with transcription as well as inputs from other chromatin features, presumably enabling elaborate gene control.© 2022.

After quality control, filtering out poorly performing probes and normalization of data, we identified the differentially methylated microRNA loci. We performed a literature-based analysis of OSCC transcriptomic data to identify the predicted target genes for each microRNA, followed by individual network and pathway enrichment analyses.The analysis of Infinium methylation array data revealed 1469 differentially hypomethylated loci, 4 of which were of interest, namely hsa-microRNA-124-3, hsa-microRNA-24-1, hsa-microRNA-769, and hsa-microRNA-4500.

"35950764","The HPV Induced Cancer Resource (THInCR): a Suite of Tools for Investigating HPV-Dependent Human Carcinogenesis.","mSphere","Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are highly infectious and cause the most common sexually transmitted viral infections. They induce hyperproliferation of squamous epithelial tissue, often forming warts. Virally encoded proteins reprogram gene expression and cell growth to create an optimal environment for viral replication. In addition to their normal roles in infection, functional alterations induced by viral proteins establish conditions that frequently contribute to human carcinogenesis. In fact, ~5% of human cancers are caused by HPVs, with virtually all cervical squamous cell carcinomas (CESC) and an increasing number of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSC) attributed to HPV infection. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) molecularly characterized thousands of primary human cancer samples in many cancer types, including CESC and HNSC, and created a comprehensive atlas of genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic data. This publicly available genome-wide information provides an unprecedented opportunity to expand the knowledge of the role that HPV plays in human carcinogenesis. While many tools exist to mine these data, few, if any, focus on the comparison of HPV-positive cancers with their HPV-negative counterparts or adjacent normal control tissue. We have constructed a suite of web-based tools, The HPV Induced Cancer Resource (THInCR), to utilize TCGA data for research related to HPV-induced CESC and HNSC. These tools allow investigators to gain greater biological and medical insights by exploring the impacts of HPV on cellular gene expression (mRNA and microRNA), altered gene methylation, and associations with patient survival and immune landscape features. These tools are accessible at https://thincr.ca/.IMPORTANCEThe suite of analytical tools of THInCR provides the opportunity to investigate the roles that candidate target genes identified in cell lines or other model systems contribute to in actual HPV-dependent human cancers and is based on large-scale TCGA data sets. Expression of target genes, including both mRNA and microRNA, can be correlated with HPV gene expression, epigenetic changes in DNA methylation, patient survival, and numerous immune features, like leukocyte infiltration, interferon gamma response, T cell response, etc. Data from these analyses may immediately provide evidence to validatein vitroobservations, reveal insights into mechanisms of virus-mediated alterations in cell growth, behavior, gene expression, and innate and adaptive immunity and may help hypothesis generation for further investigations."
"35950595","Maternal high-fat diet modifies epigenetic marks H3K27me3 and H3K27ac in bone to regulate offspring osteoblastogenesis in mice.","Epigenetics","Studies from both humans and animal models indicated that maternal chronic poor-quality diet, especially a high fat diet (HFD), is significantly associated with reduced bone density and childhood fractures in offspring. When previously studied in a rat model, our data suggested that maternal HFD changes epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation and histone modifications to control osteoblast metabolism. In mouse embryonic and postnatal offspring bone samples, a ChIP-sequencing (ChIP-Seq)-based genome-wide method was used to locate the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 (mediated via the polycomb histone methyltransferase,Ezh2) and expressive histone mark H3K27ac (p300/CBPmediated) throughout the genome. Using isolated mouse embryonic cells from foetal calvaria (osteoblast-like cells), H3K27me3 ChIP-Seq showed that 147 gene bodies and 26 gene promoters in HFD embryotic samples had a greater than twofold increase in H3K27me peaks compared to controls. Among the HFD samples,PthlhandCol2a1that are important genes playing roles during chondro- and osteogenesis had significantly enriched levels of H3K27me3. Their decreased mRNA expression was confirmed by real-time PCR and standard ChIP analysis, indicating a strong association withEzh2mediated H3K27me3 epigenetic changes. Using embryonic calvaria osteoblastic cells and offspring bone samples, H3K27ac ChIP-Seq analysis showed that osteoblast inhibitor genesTnfaip3andTwist1had significantly enriched peaks of H3K27ac in HFD samples compared to controls. Their increased gene expression and association with H3K27ac were also confirmed by real-time PCR and standard ChIP analysis. These findings indicate that chronic maternal HFD changes histone trimethylation and acetylation epigenetic marks to regulate expression of genes controlling osteoblastogenesis."
"35948305","A Protocol to Assess Adult Outcomes at 30 Years Following Preterm Birth.","Nurs Res","Among the most intense adversity experiences for infants is premature birth. Early birth marks the beginning of a life course that broadly affects families, health care, education, social systems, and the survivors themselves. For many, the transition to adulthood is challenging and often hampered by cognitive, physical and mental health, and motor and independence difficulties.To share a comprehensive protocol of a 10th follow-up study of premature infants in their 30s. The protocol accounts for stress during the neonatal period, the cumulative context (risk, protection) of development, biological and epigenetic mechanisms, and individual resilience.The prospective 5-group longitudinal design includes 215 term-born and preterm-born individuals with various neonatal morbidities at ages 30-35. Adult outcomes include health, adaptive, executive, and work and social competence. Novel measures are four system indicators of allostatic load (AL) and epigenetics. Contextual measures include socioeconomic risk and individual resilience. All measures were selected based on coherence with constructs of the scientific aims, strong psychometrics, continuity for repeated measures, and minimal subject burden. Objective assessments include body composition imaging, exercise testing, blood and saliva collection, and actigraphy. The 2-phase protocol takes approximately 8 hr.After an 11-month COVID-19 pause, participant response has been strong. As of May 2022, 75 participants have completed the full protocol, and 99 have consented to participate. When socioeconomic risk is controlled, we hypothesize that life course trajectories in physical and psychological health, adaptive function, and executive function will differ between term and preterm neonatal morbidity groups. AL will vary across groups and contribute to outcomes. We expect proximal protection and resilience to mediate the cumulative medical and socioeconomic risk and AL. Epigenome-wide DNA methylation, with estimates of age acceleration, will be examined across groups and explored in longitudinal associations with medical risk, socioeconomic status, and protection. To our knowledge, this is the only U.S. study of premature infants aged 30-35 years. With millions of preterm-born individuals reaching adulthood, the protocol incorporates molecular and genetic biomarkers in a life course developmental examination to inform the timing and content of interventions.Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Multiple AI approaches were evaluated for CHD detection. The Ingenuity Pathway Analysis program was used to identify gene pathways that were epigenetically altered and important in CHD pathogenesis to further elucidate the pathogenesis of isolated CHD.There were 12 cases of isolated non-syndromic CHDs and 26 matched controls. A total of 5918 cytosine (CpG) nucleotides involving 4976 genes had significantly altered methylation, i.e. p-value <0.05 along with ≥ 5% CpG methylation difference, in CHD vs controls. AI analysis of the methylation data achieved excellent CHD predictive accuracy :AUCs ≥0.92. For example, an AI model using a combination of five CpG markers achieved an AUC (95% CI) = 0.97 (0.87 - 1.0) with 98% sensitivity and 94% specificity. We found epigenetic changes in genes and gene pathways involved in the following important cardiac developmental processes: ""cardiovascular system development and function"", ""cardiac hypertrophy"", ""congenital heart anomaly"" and ""cardiovascular disease"".

Disruption of DNA methylation-related processes lead to diverse neurological disorders. However, the role of DNA methylation characteristics in neuronal diversity remains underexplored. Here, we report detailed context-specific DNA methylation maps for GABAergic (GABA), Glutamatergic (Glu) and Purkinje neurons, together with matched transcriptome profiles. Genome-wide mCH levels are distinguishable, while the mCG levels are similar among the three cell types. Substantial CG-DMRs are also seen, with Glu neurons experiencing substantial hypomethylation events. The relationship between mCG levels and gene expression display cell-type specific patterns, while genic CH methylation exhibits a negative effect on transcriptional abundance. We found that cell type-specific CG-DMRs are informative in terms of represented neuronal function. Furthermore, we observed that the identified Glu-specific hypo-DMRs have a high level of consistency with the chromatin accessibility of excitatory neurons and the regions enriched for histone modifications (H3K27ac and H3K4me1) of active enhancers, suggesting their regulatory potential. Hypomethylation regions specific to each cell type are predicted to bind neuron type-specific transcription factors. Finally, we show that the DNA methylation changes in a mouse model of Rett syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by the de novo mutations in MECP2, are cell type- and brain region-specific. Our results suggest that cell-type specific DNA methylation signatures are associated with the functional characteristics of the neuronal subtypes.

However, it is not yet known if hibernation affects biological ageing of individuals. Here, we use DNA methylation (DNAm) as an epigenetic biomarker of ageing to determine the effect of hibernation on the big brown bat,Eptesicus fuscus. First, we compare epigenetic age, as predicted by a multi-species epigenetic clock, between hibernating and non-hibernating animals and find that hibernation is associated with epigenetic age. Second, we identify genomic sites that exhibit hibernation-associated change in DNAm, independent of age, by comparing samples taken from the same individual in hibernating and active seasons. This paired comparison identified over 3000 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) in the genome. Genome-wide association comparisons to tissue-specific functional elements reveals that DMPs with elevated DNAm during winter occur at sites enriched for quiescent chromatin states, whereas DMPs with reduced DNAm during winter occur at sites enriched for transcription enhancers. Furthermore, genes nearest DMPs are involved in regulation of metabolic processes and innate immunity. Finally, significant overlap exists between genes nearest hibernation DMPs and genes nearest previously identified longevity DMPs. Taken together, these results are consistent with hibernation influencing ageing and longevity in bats."

DNA methylation age (DNAm age), global genome-wide DNA methylation (global methylation), telomere length (TL), and mitochondrial DNA content (mtDNA content) have independently been shown to be markers of aging, but their interrelationship and determinants at birth remain uncertain.We assessed the inter-correlation between the aging biomarkers DNAm age, global methylation, TL and mtDNA content using Pearson's correlation in 190 cord blood samples of the ENVIRONAGE birth cohort. TL and mtDNA content was measured via qPCR, while the DNA methylome was determined using the human 450K methylation Illumina microarray. Subsequently, DNAm age was calculated according to Horvath's epigenetic clock, and mean global, promoter, gene-body, and intergenic DNA methylation were determined. Path analysis, a form of structural equation modeling, was performed to disentangle the complex causal relationships among the aging biomarkers and their potential determinants.DNAm age was inversely correlated with global methylation (r = -0.64, p < 0.001) and mtDNA content (r = - 0.16, p = 0.027). Cord blood TL was correlated with mtDNA content (r = 0.26, p < 0.001) but not with global methylation or DNAm age. Path analysis showed the strongest effect for global methylation on DNAm age with a decrease of 0.64 standard deviations (SD) in DNAm age for each SD (0.01%) increase in global methylation (p < 0.001). Among the applied covariates, newborn sex and season of delivery were the strongest determinants of aging biomarkers.We provide insight into molecular aging signatures at the start of life, including their interrelations and determinants, showing that cord blood DNAm age is inversely associated with global methylation and mtDNA content but not with newborn telomere length. Our findings demonstrate that cord blood TL and DNAm age relate to different pathways/mechanisms of biological aging and can be influenced by environmental factors already at the start of life. These findings are relevant for understanding fetal programming and for the early prevention of noncommunicable diseases.© 2022. The Author(s)."

"35771651","InterpolatedXY: a two-step strategy to normalise DNA methylation microarray data avoiding sex bias.","Bioinformatics","Data normalization is an essential step to reduce technical variation within and between arrays. Due to the different karyotypes and the effects of X chromosome inactivation, females and males exhibit distinct methylation patterns on sex chromosomes, thus it poses a significant challenge to normalise sex chromosome data without introducing bias. Currently, existing methods do not provide unbiased solutions to normalise sex chromosome data, usually, they just process autosomal and sex chromosomes indiscriminately.Here, we demonstrate that ignoring this sex difference will lead to introducing artificial sex bias, especially for thousands of autosomal CpGs. We present a novel two-step strategy (interpolatedXY) to address this issue, which is applicable to all quantile-based normalisation methods. By this new strategy, the autosomal CpGs are first normalised independently by conventional methods, such as funnorm or dasen; then the corrected methylation values of sex chromosome linked CpGs are estimated as the weighted average of their nearest neighbours on autosomes. The proposed two-step strategy can also be applied to other non-quantile-based normalisation methods, as well as other array-based data types. Moreover, we propose a useful concept: the sex explained fraction of variance, to quantitatively measure the normalisation effect.The proposed methods are available by calling the function 'adjustedDasen' or 'adjustedFunnorm' in the latest wateRmelon package (https://github.com/schalkwyk/wateRmelon), with methods compatible with all the major workflows, including minfi.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.© The Author(s) 2022.

In particular, epigenetic aging is a robust predictor of health-span and disability compared to chronological age alone. The current study aimed to determine whether several epigenetic aging biomarkers were associated with high impact chronic pain in middle to older age adults (44-78 years old). Participants (n= 213) underwent a blood draw, demographic, psychosocial, pain and functional assessments. We estimated five epigenetic clocks and calculated the difference between epigenetic age and chronological age, which has been previously reported to predict overall mortality risk, as well as included additional derived variables of epigenetic age previously associated with pain. There were significant differences across Pain Impact groups in three out of the five epigenetic clocks examined (DNAmAge, DNAmPhenoAge and DNAmGrimAge), indicating that pain-related disability during the past 6 months was associated with markers of epigenetic aging. Only DNAmPhenoAge and DNAmGrimAge were associated with higher knee pain intensity during the past 48 h. Finally, pain catastrophizing, depressive symptomatology and more neuropathic pain symptoms were significantly associated with an older epigenome in only one of the five epigenetic clocks (i.e. DNAmGrimAge) after correcting for multiple comparisons (correctedp's < 0.05). Given the scant literature in relation to epigenetic aging and the complex experience of pain, additional research is needed to understand whether epigenetic aging may help identify people with chronic pain at greater risk of functional decline and poorer health outcomes."

In this nested case-control study within Doetinchem Cohort Study, we included 132 incident T2D cases and 132 age- and sex-matched controls. DNAm was measured in blood using the Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC array. From 107 CpG sites associated with T2D, 10 CpG sites (9%) showed different slopes of DNAm trajectories over time (p < 0.05) and an additional 8 CpG sites (8%) showed significant differences in DNAm levels (at least 1%, p-value per time point < 0.05) at all three time points with nearly parallel trajectories between incident T2D cases and controls. In controls, age acceleration levels were negative (slower epigenetic aging), while in incident T2D cases, levels were positive, suggesting accelerated aging in the case group. We showed that DNAm levels at specific CpG sites, up to 10 years before T2D onset, are different between incident T2D cases and healthy controls and distinct patterns of clinical traits over time may have an impact on those DNAm profiles. Up to 10 years before T2D diagnosis, cases manifested accelerated epigenetic aging. Markers of biological aging including age acceleration estimates based on Horvath need further investigation to assess their utility for predicting age-related diseases including T2D.© 2022.

In blood, FEV1/FVC<LLN was associated with greater GrimAge residuals (Beta=1.74, 95%CI=0.37-3.24, P=0.019). FEV1decline was inversely correlated with GrimAge residuals in blood (r=-0.13, P=0.012). PLWH who had normal lung function but who subsequently developed an FEV1/FVC<0.70 over the course of 6 years had higher GrimAge residuals at baseline (Beta=2.33, 95%CI=0.23-4.44, P=0.031).GrimAge may reflect lung and systemic epigenetic changes that occur with advanced airflow obstruction and may help to identify PLWH with a higher risk of developing COPD.Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the British Columbia Lung Association.

"35778957","Human age reversal: Fact or fiction?","Aging Cell","Although chronological age correlates with various age-related diseases and conditions, it does not adequately reflect an individual's functional capacity, well-being, or mortality risk. In contrast, biological age provides information about overall health and indicates how rapidly or slowly a person is aging. Estimates of biological age are thought to be provided by aging clocks, which are computational models (e.g., elastic net) that use a set of inputs (e.g., DNA methylation sites) to make a prediction. In the past decade, aging clock studies have shown that several age-related diseases, social variables, and mental health conditions associate with an increase in predicted biological age relative to chronological age. This phenomenon of age acceleration is linked to a higher risk of premature mortality. More recent research has demonstrated that predicted biological age is sensitive to specific interventions. Human trials have reported that caloric restriction, a plant-based diet, lifestyle changes involving exercise, a drug regime including metformin, and vitamin D3 supplementation are all capable of slowing down or reversing an aging clock. Non-interventional studies have connected high-quality sleep, physical activity, a healthy diet, and other factors to age deceleration. Specific molecules have been associated with the reduction or reversal of predicted biological age, such as the antihypertensive drug doxazosin or the metabolite alpha-ketoglutarate. Although rigorous clinical trials are needed to validate these initial findings, existing data suggest that aging clocks are malleable in humans. Additional research is warranted to better understand these computational models and the clinical significance of lowering or reversing their outputs.© 2022 Tally Health.

However, a growing body of evidence is pointing toward an increased incidence of epigenetic/imprinting disorders in the offspring, raising concern that the techniques involved may have an impact on crucial stages of early embryo and fetal development highly vulnerable to epigenetic influence. In this paper, the key role of methylation processes in epigenesis, namely the essential biochemical/metabolic pathways involving folates and one-carbon cycles necessary for correct DNA/histone methylation, is discussed. Furthermore, potential contributors to epigenetics dysregulation during the three phases of assisted reproduction: preparation for and controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH); methylation processes during the preimplantation embryo culture stages; the effects of unmetabolized folic acid (UMFA) during embryogenesis on imprinting methyl ""tags"", are described. Advances in technology have opened a window into developmental processes that were previously inaccessible to research: it is now clear that ART procedures have the potential to influence DNA methylation in embryonic and fetal life, with an impact on health and disease risk in future generations. Critical re-evaluation of protocols and procedures is now an urgent priority, with a focus on interventions targeted toward improving ART procedures, with special attention to in vitro culture protocols and the effects of excessive folic acid intake."

However, the underlying mechanisms behind these phenomena remain elusive. Remarkably, the magnetic energies implicated in these effects are much smaller than thermal energies. Here, we review these observations, and we suggest an explanation based on the radical pair mechanism, which involves the quantum dynamics of the electron and nuclear spins of transient radical molecules. While the radical pair mechanism has been studied in detail in the context of avian magnetoreception, the studies reviewed here show that magnetosensitivity is widespread throughout biology. We review magnetic field effects on various physiological functions, discussing static, hypomagnetic and oscillating magnetic fields, as well as isotope effects. We then review the radical pair mechanism as a potential unifying model for the described magnetic field effects, and we discuss plausible candidate molecules for the radical pairs. We review recent studies proposing that the radical pair mechanism provides explanations for isotope effects in xenon anaesthesia and lithium treatment of hyperactivity, magnetic field effects on the circadian clock, and hypomagnetic field effects on neurogenesis and microtubule assembly. We conclude by discussing future lines of investigation in this exciting new area of quantum biology."

Purpose of the present article is to compare mental health (depressive and Post-Traumatic-Stress-Disorders-PTSD-symptoms) and epigenetics aspects (degree of methylation of stress-related genes) in front-line healthcare professionals versus healthcare working in non-COVID-19 wards. Sixty-eight healthcare workers were included in the study: 39 were working in COVID-19 wards (cases) and 29 in non-COVID wards (controls). From all participants, demographic and clinical information were collected by an ad-hoc questionnaire. Depressive and PTSD symptoms were evaluated by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), respectively. Methylation analyses of 9 promoter/regulatory regions of genes known to be implicated in depression/PTSD (ADCYAP1, BDNF, CRHR1, DRD2, IGF2, LSD1/KDM1A, NR3C1, OXTR, SLC6A4) were performed on DNA from blood samples by the MassARRAY EpiTYPER platform, with MassCleave settings. Controls showed more frequent lifetime history of anxiety/depression with respect to cases (χ2 = 5.72, p = 0.03). On the contrary, cases versus controls presented higher PHQ-9 (t = 2.13, p = 0.04), PHQ-9 sleep item (t = 2.26, p = 0.03), IES-R total (t = 2.17, p = 0.03), IES-R intrusion (t = 2.46, p = 0.02), IES-R avoidance (t = 1.99, p = 0.05) mean total scores. Methylation levels at CRHR1, DRD2 and LSD1 genes was significantly higher in cases with respect to controls (p < 0.01, p = 0.03 and p = 0.03, respectively). Frontline health professionals experienced more negative effects on mental health during COVID-19 pandemic than non-frontline healthcare workers. Methylation levels were increased in genes regulating HPA axis (CRHR1) and dopamine neurotransmission (DRD2 and LSD1), thus supporting the involvement of these biological processes in depression/PTSD and indicating that methylation of these genes can be modulated by stress conditions, such as working as healthcare front-line during COVID-19 pandemic.© 2022.

We researched the literature from 2016 to November 2021 to find the most promising new molecules and divided them into seven different subgroups based on their function and location in the cell. Although cystoscopy and cytology are still the gold standard for diagnosis and surveillance when it comes to bladder cancer (BCa), their cost is quite a burden for national health systems worldwide. Currently, the research is focused on finding a biomarker that has high negative predictive value (NPV) and can exclude with a certainty the presence of the tumor, considering missing it could be disastrous for the patient. Every subgroup has its own advantages and disadvantages; for example, protein biomarkers cost less than genomic ones, but on the other hand, they seem to be less precise. We tried to simplify this complicated topic as much as possible in order to make it comprehensible to doctors and urologists that are not as familiar with it, as well as encourage them to actively participate in ongoing research."

We investigated methylation levels of DRD2 and NR3C1 in peripheral blood of patients with recent-onset (RO) psychosis using bisulfite pyrosequencing as well as its association with childhood trauma and rumination.In all, 51 individuals with RO psychosis and 47 healthy controls were recruited. DNA methylation levels in the targeted regions of two genes were analyzed and compared. Childhood trauma and rumination were evaluated using the Early Trauma Inventory Self-Report Short Form (ETI-SF) and Brooding Scale (BS), respectively. Correlations between the scores of the ETI-SF and BS and methylation levels were explored.For DRD2, we found no significant differences between groups in terms of methylation level or association with childhood trauma or rumination. For NR3C1, we found a trend level significance for average value of all CpG sites and significant hypermethylation or hypomethylation at specific sites. There was also a significant positive correlation between the methylation level at the CpG8 site of NR3C1 exon 1F and negative symptom subscale score of the PANSS (PANSS-N).Epigenetic alterations of NR3C1 are associated with the pathophysiology of psychosis.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TOMM40, a critical gene that produces the outer membrane protein TOM40 of mitochondria, have been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegenerative processes. Yet it is not clear whether or how the mitochondria may impact human longevity. We conducted this review to ascertain which SNPs have been associated with markers of healthy aging.Using the PRISMA methodology, we conducted a systematic review on PubMed and Embase databases to identify associations between TOMM40 SNPs and measures of longevity and healthy aging.Twenty-four articles were selected. The TOMM40 SNPs rs2075650 and rs10524523 were the two most commonly identified and studied SNPs associated with longevity. The outcomes associated with the TOMM40 SNPs were changes in BMI, brain integrity, cognitive functions, altered inflammatory network, vulnerability to vascular risk factors, and longevity.Our systematic review identified multiple TOMM40 SNPs potentially associated with healthy aging.

"35907208","Aging the brain: multi-region methylation principal component based clock in the context of Alzheimer's disease.","Aging (Albany NY)","Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk increases exponentially with age and is associated with multiple molecular hallmarks of aging, one of which is epigenetic alterations. Epigenetic age predictors based on 5' cytosine methylation (DNAm), or epigenetic clocks, have previously suggested that epigenetic age acceleration may occur in AD brain tissue. Epigenetic clocks are promising tools for the quantification of biological aging, yet we hypothesize that investigation of brain aging in AD will be assisted by the development of brain-specific epigenetic clocks. Therefore, we generated a novel age predictor termed PCBrainAge that was trained solely in cortical samples. This predictor utilizes a combination of principal components analysis and regularized regression, which reduces technical noise and greatly improves test-retest reliability. To characterize the scope of PCBrainAge's utility, we generated DNAm data from multiple brain regions in a sample from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project. PCBrainAge captures meaningful heterogeneity of aging: Its acceleration demonstrates stronger associations with clinical AD dementia, pathologic AD, and APOE ε4 carrier status compared to extant epigenetic age predictors. It further does so across multiple cortical and subcortical regions. Overall, PCBrainAge's increased reliability and specificity makes it a particularly promising tool for investigating heterogeneity in brain aging, as well as epigenetic alterations underlying AD risk and resilience."

In-invitro diagnostic technique may provide a solution when sufficient biomarkers could be identified. Pertinent associations between blood-based aberrant DNA methylation and smoking, the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, and CHD have been robustly demonstrated and replicated, but that studies in Chinese populations are rare. The blood-based methylation of aryl-hydrocarbon receptor repressor (AHRR) cg05575921 and 6p21.33 cg06126421 has been associated with cardiovascular mortality in Caucasians. Here, we aim to investigate whether the AHRR and 6p21.33 methylation in the blood is associated with CHD in the Chinese population.In this case-control study, 180 CHD patients recruited at their first registration in our study center, and 184 controls randomly selected from the people who participated in the annual health examination were enrolled. Methylation intensities of 19 CpG sites, including AHRR cg05575921, 6p21.33 cg06126421, and their flanking CpG sites, were quantified by mass spectrometry. The association between methylation intensities and CHD was estimated by logistic regression analyses adjusted for covariant.Compared to the controls, lower methylation of 6p21.33_CpG_4.5/cg06126421 was independently associated with increased odds of being a CHD patient (OR per - 10% methylation = 1.42 after adjustment for age, gender, and batch effect; p = 0.032 by multiple testing corrections). No association between blood-based AHRR methylation and CHD was found.6p21.33 methylation exhibits a significant association with CHD.

Despite multiple studies, AS pathophysiology is still obscure and has mostly been explored in rodent models of the disease. In recent years, a growing body of studies has utilized omics datasets in the attempt to focus research regarding the pathophysiology of AS. Here, for the first time, we utilized a multi-omics approach at the epigenomic level and the transcriptome level, for human-derived neurons. Using publicly available datasets for DNA methylation and gene expression, we found genome regions in proximity to gene promoters and intersecting with gene-body regions that were differentially methylated and differentially expressed in AS. We found that overall, the genome in AS postmortem brain tissue was hypo-methylated compared to healthy controls. We also found more upregulated genes than downregulated genes in AS. Many of these dysregulated genes in neurons obtained from AS patients are known to be critical for neuronal development and synaptic functioning. Taken together, our results suggest a list of dysregulated genes that may be involved in AS development and its pathological features. Moreover, these genes might also have a role in neurodevelopmental disorders similar to AS."

Understanding the genetic basis of tuber traits should guide selection and improve breeding efficiencies. However, this is challenging in potato due to the complexity of the traits and the polyploid nature of the potato genome. High-throughput affordable molecular markers and new software specific for polyploid species have the potential to unlock previously unattainable levels of understanding of the genetic basis of tuber traits in tetraploid potato. In this study, we genotyped a diversity panel of 214 advanced clones with the 22 K SNP potato array and phenotyped it in three field environments in Texas. We conducted a genome-wide association study using the GWASpoly software package to identify genomic regions associated with tuber morphological traits. Some of the QTLs discovered confirmed prior studies, whereas others were discovered for the first time. The main QTL for tuber shape was detected on chromosome 10 and explained 5.8% of the phenotypic variance. GWAS analysis of eye depth detected a significant QTL on chromosome 10 and explained 3.9% of the phenotypic variance. Another QTL peak for eye depth on chromosome 5 was located near theCDF1gene, an important regulator of maturity in potato. Our study found that multiple QTLs govern russeting in potato. A major QTL for flesh color on chromosome 3 that explained 26% of the phenotypic variance likely represents theYlocus responsible for yellow flesh in potato tubers. Several QTLs were detected for purple skin color on chromosome 11. Furthermore, genomic estimated breeding values were obtained, which will aid in the early identification of superior parental clones that should increase the chances of producing progenies with higher frequencies of the desired tuber traits. These findings will contribute to a better understanding of the genetic basis of morphological traits in potato, as well as to identifying parents with the best breeding values to improve selection efficiency in our potato breeding program.Copyright © 2022 Pandey, Scheuring, Koym and Vales."
"35957879","A Review of Mathematical and Computational Methods in Cancer Dynamics.","Front Oncol","Cancers are complex adaptive diseases regulated by the nonlinear feedback systems between genetic instabilities, environmental signals, cellular protein flows, and gene regulatory networks. Understanding the cybernetics of cancer requires the integration of information dynamics across multidimensional spatiotemporal scales, including genetic, transcriptional, metabolic, proteomic, epigenetic, and multi-cellular networks. However, the time-series analysis of these complex networks remains vastly absent in cancer research. With longitudinal screening and time-series analysis of cellular dynamics, universally observed causal patterns pertaining to dynamical systems, may self-organize in the signaling or gene expression state-space of cancer triggering processes. A class of these patterns, strange attractors, may be mathematical biomarkers of cancer progression. The emergence of intracellular chaos and chaotic cell population dynamics remains a new paradigm in systems medicine. As such, chaotic and complex dynamics are discussed as mathematical hallmarks of cancer cell fate dynamics herein. Given the assumption that time-resolved single-cell datasets are made available, a survey of interdisciplinary tools and algorithms from complexity theory, are hereby reviewed to investigate critical phenomena and chaotic dynamics in cancer ecosystems. To conclude, the perspective cultivates an intuition for computational systems oncology in terms of nonlinear dynamics, information theory, inverse problems, and complexity.

"35983412","Incomplete Penetrance and Variable Expressivity: From Clinical Studies to Population Cohorts.","Front Genet","The same genetic variant found in different individuals can cause a range of diverse phenotypes, from no discernible clinical phenotype to severe disease, even among related individuals. Such variants can be said to display incomplete penetrance, a binary phenomenon where the genotype either causes the expected clinical phenotype or it does not, or they can be said to display variable expressivity, in which the same genotype can cause a wide range of clinical symptoms across a spectrum. Both incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity are thought to be caused by a range of factors, including common variants, variants in regulatory regions, epigenetics, environmental factors, and lifestyle. Many thousands of genetic variants have been identified as the cause of monogenic disorders, mostly determined through small clinical studies, and thus, the penetrance and expressivity of these variants may be overestimated when compared to their effect on the general population. With the wealth of population cohort data currently available, the penetrance and expressivity of such genetic variants can be investigated across a much wider contingent, potentially helping to reclassify variants that were previously thought to be completely penetrant. Research into the penetrance and expressivity of such genetic variants is important for clinical classification, both for determining causative mechanisms of disease in the affected population and for providing accurate risk information through genetic counseling. A genotype-based definition of the causes of rare diseases incorporating information from population cohorts and clinical studies is critical for our understanding of incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity. This review examines our current knowledge of the penetrance and expressivity of genetic variants in rare disease and across populations, as well as looking into the potential causes of the variation seen, including genetic modifiers, mosaicism, and polygenic factors, among others. We also considered the challenges that come with investigating penetrance and expressivity.Copyright © 2022 Kingdom and Wright."

At present, there is a lack of radical treatments for preventing disease progression. Therefore, we aimed to identify effective drug targets that slow the progression of AAs.A Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was conducted to identify therapeutic targets which are associated with AAs. Summary statistics for AAs were obtained from two datasets: the UK Biobank (2228 cases and 408,565 controls) and the FinnGen study (3658 cases and 244,907 controls). Cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL) for druggable genes were retrieved from the eQTLGen Consortium and used as genetic instrumental variables. Colocalization analysis was performed to determine the probability that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with AAs and eQTL shared causal genetic variants.Four drug targets (BTN3A1, FASN, PLAU, and PSMA4) showed significant MR results in two independent datasets. Proteasome 20S subunit alpha 4 (PSMA4) and plasminogen activator, urokinase (PLAU) in particular, were found to have strong evidence for colocalization with AAs, and abdominal aortic aneurysm in particular. Additionally, except for the association between PSMA4 and intracranial aneurysms, no association between genetically proxied inhibition of PLAU and PSMA4 was detected in increasing the risk of other cardiometabolic risks and diseases.This study supports that drug-targeting PLAU and PSMA4 inhibition may reduce the risk of AAs.This work was supported by National Key R&D Program of China (NO. 2017YFC0909400), Nature Science Foundation of China (No. 91839302, 81790624), Project supported by Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major Project (Grant No. 2017SHZDZX01), and Tongji Hospital Clinical Research Flagship Program (no. 2019CR207).Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

"35724929","Shelterin Components Modulate Nucleic Acids Condensation and Phase Separation in the Context of Telomeric DNA.","J Mol Biol","Telomeres are nucleoprotein complexes that protect the ends of chromosomes and are essential for chromosome stability in Eukaryotes. In cells, individual telomeres form distinct globules of finite size that appear to be smaller than expected for bare DNA. Moreover, telomeres can cluster together, form telomere-induced-foci or co-localize with promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies. The physical basis for collapse of individual telomeres and coalescence of multiple ones remains unclear, as does the relationship between these two phenomena. By combining single-molecule force spectroscopy measurements, optical microscopy, turbidity assays, and simulations, we show that the telomere scaffolding protein TRF2 can condense individual DNA chains and drives coalescence of multiple DNA molecules, leading to phase separation and the formation of liquid-like droplets. Addition of the TRF2 binding protein hRap1 modulates phase boundaries and tunes the specificity of solution demixing while simultaneously altering the degree of DNA compaction. Our results suggest that the condensation of single telomeres and formation of biomolecular condensates containing multiple telomeres are two different outcomes driven by the same set of molecular interactions. Moreover, binding partners, such as other telomere components, can alter those interactions to promote single-chain DNA compaction over multiple-chain phase separation.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

DNMT isoforms show differential expression by cell lineage and during development, but much remains to be elucidated about their shared and unique genomic targets.We examined changes in the epigenome following overexpression of 13 DNMT isoforms in HEK293T cells. We observed increased methylation (Δβ > 0.2) at 43,405 CpG sites, with expression of DNMT3A2, DNMTΔ3B4 and DNMTΔ3B2 associated with the greatest impact. De novo methylation occurred primarily within open sea regions and at loci with intermediate methylation levels (β: 0.2-0.6). 53% of differentially methylated loci showed specificity towards a single DNMT subfamily, primarily DNMTΔ3B and DNMT3A and 39% towards a single isoform. These loci were significantly enriched for pathways related to neuronal development (DNMTΔ3B4), calcium homeostasis (DNMTΔ3B3) and ion transport (DNMT3L). Repetitive elements did not display differential sensitivity to overexpressed DNMTs, but hypermethylation of Alu elements was associated with their evolutionary age following overexpression of DNMT3A2, DNMT3B1, DNMT3B2 and DNMT3L. Differential methylation (Δβ > 0.1) was observed at 121 of the 353 loci associated with the Horvath 'epigenetic clock' model of ageing, with 51 showing isoform specificity, and was associated with reduction of epigenetic age by 5-15 years following overexpression of seven isoforms. Finally, we demonstrate the potential for dietary constituents to modify epigenetic marks through isoform-specific inhibition of methylation activity.Our results provide insight into regions of the genome methylated uniquely by specific DNMT isoforms and demonstrate the potential for dietary intervention to modify the epigenome.© 2022.

"35962910","Future Prospects for Epigenetics in Autism Spectrum Disorder.","Mol Diagn Ther","Despite decades of investigation into the genetics of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a current consensus in the field persists that ASD risk is too heterogeneous to be diagnosed by a single set of genetic variants. As such, ASD research has broadened to include assessment of other molecular biomarkers implicated in the condition that may be reflective of environmental exposures or gene by environment interactions. Epigenetic variance, and specifically differential DNA methylation, have emerged as areas of particularly high interest to ASD, as the epigenetic markers from specific chromatin loci collectively can reflect influences of multiple genetic and environmental factors and can also result in differential gene expression patterns. This review examines recent studies of the ASD epigenome, detailing common gene pathways found to be differentially methylated in people with ASD, and considers how these discoveries may inform our understanding of ASD etiology. We also consider future applications of epigenetics in ASD research and clinical practice, focusing on substratification, biomarker development, and experimental preclinical models of ASD that test causality. In combination with other -omics approaches, epigenomics allows an improved conceptualization of the multifactorial nature of ASD, and opens future lines of inquiry for both basic research and clinical practice.© 2022.

"35948532","Cell-type-specific epigenetic effects of early life stress on the brain.","Transl Psychiatry","Early life stress (ELS) induces long-term phenotypic adaptations that contribute to increased vulnerability to a host of neuropsychiatric disorders. Epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modifications and non-coding RNA, are a proposed link between environmental stressors, alterations in gene expression, and phenotypes. Epigenetic modifications play a primary role in shaping functional differences between cell types and can be modified by environmental perturbations, especially in early development. Together with contributions from genetic variation, epigenetic mechanisms orchestrate patterns of gene expression within specific cell types that contribute to phenotypic variation between individuals. To date, many studies have provided insights into epigenetic changes resulting from ELS. However, most of these studies have examined heterogenous brain tissue, despite evidence of cell-type-specific epigenetic modifications in phenotypes associated with ELS. In this review, we focus on rodent and human studies that have examined epigenetic modifications induced by ELS in select cell types isolated from the brain or associated with genes that have cell-type-restricted expression in neurons, microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. Although significant challenges remain, future studies using these approaches can enable important mechanistic insight into the role of epigenetic variation in the effects of ELS on brain function.© 2022.

"35937838","The Effect of Sleep Restriction, With or Without Exercise, on Skeletal Muscle Transcriptomic Profiles in Healthy Young Males.","Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)","Inadequate sleep is associated with many detrimental health effects, including increased risk of developing insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. These effects have been associated with changes to the skeletal muscle transcriptome, although this has not been characterised in response to a period of sleep restriction. Exercise induces a beneficial transcriptional response within skeletal muscle that may counteract some of the negative effects associated with sleep restriction. We hypothesised that sleep restriction would down-regulate transcriptional pathways associated with glucose metabolism, but that performing exercise would mitigate these effects.20 healthy young males were allocated to one of three experimental groups: a Normal Sleep (NS) group (8 h time in bed per night (TIB), for five nights (11 pm - 7 am)), a Sleep Restriction (SR) group (4 h TIB, for five nights (3 am - 7 am)), and a Sleep Restriction and Exercise group (SR+EX) (4 h TIB, for five nights (3 am - 7 am) and three high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) sessions (performed at 10 am)). RNA sequencing was performed on muscle samples collected pre- and post-intervention. Our data was then compared to skeletal muscle transcriptomic data previously reported following sleep deprivation (24 h without sleep).Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) indicated there was an increased enrichment of inflammatory and immune response related pathways in the SR group post-intervention. However, in the SR+EX group the direction of enrichment in these same pathways occurred in the opposite directions. Despite this, there were no significant changes at the individual gene level from pre- to post-intervention. A set of genes previously shown to be decreased with sleep deprivation was also decreased in the SR group, but increased in the SR+EX group.The alterations to inflammatory and immune related pathways in skeletal muscle, following five nights of sleep restriction, provide insight regarding the transcriptional changes that underpin the detrimental effects associated with sleep loss. Performing three sessions of HIIE during sleep restriction attenuated some of these transcriptional changes. Overall, the transcriptional alterations observed with a moderate period of sleep restriction were less evident than previously reported changes following a period of sleep deprivation.Copyright © 2022 Lin, Saner, Weng, Caruana, Botella, Kuang, Lee, Jamnick, Pitchford, Garnham, Bartlett, Chen and Bishop."
"35993268","Changes in Small Noncoding RNA Expression during Chondrocyte Senescence.","Cartilage","Osteoarthritis (OA) is characterized by the chronic and progressive deterioration of articular cartilage. Chondrocyte senescence could lead to a shift in the balance between extracellular matrix (ECM) component synthesis and degradation. Small noncoding RNAs (sncRNAs), including microRNAs (miRNAs), P-element-induced wimpy testis-(PIWI-) interacting RNAs (piRNAs), small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), and repeat-associated siRNAs (rasiRNAs), are a class of important epigenetic molecules. We aimed to gain insights into the changes and roles of sncRNA in chondrocyte senescence.Healthy mouse postnatal chondrocytes were isolated, and a replicative aging model was constructed. We used small RNA sequencing (small RNA-seq) to generate extensive small RNA data. We identified differentially expressed sncRNAs and performed tissue-specific analysis using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). β-galactosidase staining was used to detect chondrocyte senescence. The results showed that the expression profiles of sncRNA in passage 5 chondrocytes were significantly different from those in passage 0 chondrocytes. The expression of sncRNA was tissue specific. We found that 40 miRNAs were upregulated and 70 miRNAs were downregulated during chondrocyte senescence, and that miR-132-5p expression inhibition prevented chondrocyte senescence. We found that 8 piRNAs were upregulated and 17 piRNAs were downregulated during chondrocyte senescence, and that piRNA piR_025576 overexpression delayed chondrocyte senescence. We found that 24 snoRNAs were upregulated and 28 snoRNAs were downregulated during chondrocyte senescence, and that snoRNA ENSMUSG00000087935 overexpression delayed chondrocyte senescence. We found that 5 snRNAs were upregulated and 6 snRNAs were downregulated during chondrocyte senescence, and that snRNA ENSMUSG00000064682 overexpression delayed chondrocyte senescence. We found that 1 rasiRNA was upregulated and 4 rasiRNAs were downregulated during chondrocyte senescence.These findings might provide novel insights into OA pathogenesis and contribute to the development of candidates for targeted therapeutics in OA."
"36040576","Assessing Differential Variability of High-Throughput DNA Methylation Data.","Curr Environ Health Rep","DNA methylation (DNAm) is essential to human development and plays an important role as a biomarker due to its susceptibility to environmental exposures. This article reviews the current state of statistical methods developed for differential variability analysis focusing on DNAm data.With the advent of high-throughput technologies allowing for highly reliable and cost-effective measurements of DNAm, many epigenome studies have analyzed DNAm levels to uncover biological mechanisms underlying past environmental exposures and subsequent health outcomes. These studies typically focused on detecting sites or regions which differ in their mean DNAm levels among exposure groups. However, more recent studies highlighted the importance of identifying differentially variable sites or regions as biologically relevant features. Currently, the analysis of differentially variable DNAm sites has not yet gained widespread adoption in environmental studies; yet, it is important to examine the effects of environmental exposures on inter-individual epigenetic variability. In this article, we describe six of the most widely used statistical approaches for analyzing differential variability of DNAm levels and provide a discussion of their advantages and current limitations.© 2022.

"35967118","The Heritability of Kidney Function Using an Older Australian Twin Population.","Kidney Int Rep","Twin studies are unique population models which estimate observed rather than inferred genetic components of complex traits. Nonmonogenic chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a complex disease process with strong genetic and environmental influences, amenable to twin studies. We aimed to assess the heritability of CKD using twin analysis and modeling within Older Australian Twin Study (OATS) data.OATS had 109 dizygotic (DZ) and 126 monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs with paired serum creatinine levels. Heritability of kidney function as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR CKD Epidemiology Collaboration [CKD-EPI]) was modeled using the ACE model to estimate additive heritability (A), common (C), and unique (E) environmental factors. Intratwin pair analysis using mixed effects logistic regression allowed analysis of variation in eGFR from established CKD risk factors.The median age was 69.71 (interquartile range 78.4-83.0) years, with 65% female, and a mean CKD-EPI of 82.8 ml/min (SD 6.7). The unadjusted ACE model determined kidney function to be 33% genetically determined (A), 18% shared genetic-environmental (C), and 49% because of unique environment (E). This remained unchanged when adjusted for age, hypertension, and sex. Hypertension was associated with eGFR; however, intertwin variance in hypertension did not explain variance in eGFR. Two or more hypertension medications were associated with decreased eGFR (P = 0.009).This study estimates observed heritability at 33%, notably higher than inferred heritability in genome-wide association study (GWAS) (7.1%-18%). Epigenetics and other genomic phenomena may explain this heritability gap. Difference in antihypertension medications explains part of unique environmental exposures, though discordance in hypertension and diabetes does not.© 2022 International Society of Nephrology.

"35948692","How does age determine the development of human immune-mediated arthritis?","Nat Rev Rheumatol","Does age substantially affect the emergence of human immune-mediated arthritis? Children do not usually develop immune-mediated articular inflammation during their first year of life. In patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, this apparent 'immune privilege' disintegrates, and chronic inflammation is associated with variable autoantibody signatures and patterns of disease that resemble adult arthritis phenotypes. Numerous mechanisms might be involved in this shift, including genetic and epigenetic predisposing factors, maturation of the immune system with a progressive modulation of putative tolerogenic controls, parallel development of microbial dysbiosis, accumulation of a pro-inflammatory burden driven by environmental exposures (the exposome) and comorbidity-related drivers. By exploring these mechanisms, we expand the discussion of three (not mutually exclusive) hypotheses on how these factors can contribute to the differences and similarities between the loss of immune tolerance in children and the development of established immune-mediated arthritis in adults. These three hypotheses relate to a critical window in genetics and epigenetics, immune maturation, and the accumulation of burden. The varied manifestation of the underlying mechanisms among individuals is only beginning to be clarified, but the establishment of a framework can facilitate the development of an integrated understanding of the pathogenesis of arthritis across all ages.© 2022.

"35982161","Genetic control of RNA splicing and its distinct role in complex trait variation.","Nat Genet","Most genetic variants identified from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in humans are noncoding, indicating their role in gene regulation. Previous studies have shown considerable links of GWAS signals to expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) but the links to other genetic regulatory mechanisms, such as splicing QTLs (sQTLs), are underexplored. Here, we introduce an sQTL mapping method, ﻿testing for heterogeneity between isoform-eQTL effects (THISTLE), with improved power over competing methods. Applying THISTLE together with a complementary sQTL mapping strategy to brain transcriptomic (n = 2,865) and genotype data, we identified 12,794 genes with cis-sQTLs at P < 5 × 10-8, approximately 61% of which were distinct from eQTLs. Integrating the sQTL data into GWAS for 12 brain-related complex traits (including diseases), we identified 244 genes associated with the traits through cis-sQTLs, approximately 61% of which could not be discovered using the corresponding eQTL data. Our study demonstrates the distinct role of most sQTLs in the genetic regulation of transcription and complex trait variation.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified genetic variants associated with diseases but usually did not reveal the underlying mechanisms. There could be many intermediate steps at epigenetic, transcriptomic, and cellular scales inside the black box of genotype-phenotype associations. In this article, we present a machine-learning-based cross-scale framework GRPath to decipher putative causal paths (pcPaths) from genetic variants to disease phenotypes by integrating multiple omics data. Applying GRPath on CVD, we identified 646 and 549 pcPaths linking putative causal regions, variants, and gene expressions in specific cell types for two types of heart failure, respectively. The findings suggest new understandings of coronary heart disease. Our work promoted the modeling of tissue- and cell type-specific cross-scale regulation to uncover mechanisms behind disease-associated variants, and provided new findings on the molecular mechanisms of CVD.© 2022 The Author(s)."
"35943608","Locus-level antagonistic selection shaped the polygenic architecture of human complex diseases.","Hum Genet","We aimed to evaluate the potential role of antagonistic selection in polygenic diseases: if one variant increases the risk of one disease and decreases the risk of another disease, the signals of genetic risk elimination by natural selection will be distorted, which leads to a higher frequency of risk alleles.We applied local genetic correlations and transcriptome-wide association studies to identify genomic loci and genes adversely associated with at least two diseases. Then, we used different population genetic metrics to measure the signals of natural selection for these loci and genes.First, we identified 2120 cases of antagonistic pleiotropy (negative local genetic correlation) among 87 diseases in 716 genomic loci (antagonistic loci). Next, by comparing with non-antagonistic loci, we observed that antagonistic loci explained an excess proportion of disease heritability (median 6%), showed enhanced signals of balancing selection, and reduced signals of directional polygenic adaptation. Then, at the gene expression level, we identified 31,991 cases of antagonistic pleiotropy among 98 diseases at 4368 genes. However, evidence of altered signals of selection pressure and heritability distribution at the gene expression level is limited.We conclude that antagonistic pleiotropy is widespread among human polygenic diseases, and it has distorted the evolutionary signal and genetic architecture of diseases at the locus level.© 2022.

By integrating large-scale biobank resources (Biobank Japan and UK biobank), our study included 105 721 cases and 433 663 controls. Newly identified variants were evaluated in 21 778 cases and 712 767 controls for two additional autoimmune diseases: psoriasis and systemic lupus erythematosus. We performed enrichment analyses of cell types and biological pathways to highlight shared and distinct perspectives.Autoimmune and allergic diseases were not only mutually classified based on genetic backgrounds but also they had multiple positive genetic correlations beyond the classifications.

Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in particular have been found to be highly heritable and genetically influenced. However, understanding of the biological basis of psychosis in Latin American populations is limited as previous genomic studies have almost exclusively relied on participants of Northern European ancestry. With the goal of expanding knowledge on the genomic basis of psychotic disorders within the Mexican population, the National Institute of Psychiatry Ramón de la Fuente Muñiz (INPRFM), the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and the Broad Institute's Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research launched the Neuropsychiatric Genetics Research of Psychosis in Mexican Populations (NeuroMex) project to collect and analyze case-control psychosis samples from 5 states across Mexico. This article describes the planned sample collection and GWAS protocol for the NeuroMex study. The 4-year study will span from April 2018 to 2022 and aims to recruit 9,208 participants: 4,604 cases and 4,604 controls. Study sites across Mexico were selected to ensure collected samples capture the genomic diversity within the Mexican population. Blood samples and phenotypic data will be collected during the participant interview process and will contribute to the development of a local biobank in Mexico. DNA extraction will be done locally and genetic analysis will take place at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, MA. We will collect extensive phenotypic information using several clinical scales. All study materials including phenotypic instruments utilized are openly available in Spanish and English. The described study represents a long-term collaboration of a number of institutions from across Mexico and the Boston area, including clinical psychiatrists, clinical researchers, computational biologists, and managers at the 3 collaborating institutions. The development of relevant data management, quality assurance, and analysis plans are the primary considerations in this protocol article. Extensive management and analysis processes were developed for both the phenotypic and genetic data collected. Capacity building, partnerships, and training between and among the collaborating institutions are intrinsic components to this study and its long-term success.Copyright © 2021 by S.

Using data from 22,000 British Pakistani and Bangladeshi individuals with linked electronic health records from the Genes & Health cohort, we conducted genome-wide association studies of coronary artery disease and its key risk factors. Using power-adjusted transferability ratios, we found evidence for transferability for the majority of cardiometabolic loci powered to replicate. The performance of polygenic scores was high for lipids and blood pressure, but lower for BMI and coronary artery disease. Adding a polygenic score for coronary artery disease to clinical risk factors showed significant improvement in reclassification. In Mendelian randomisation using transferable loci as instruments, our findings were consistent with results in European-ancestry individuals. Taken together, trait-specific transferability of trait loci between populations is an important consideration with implications for risk prediction and causal inference.© 2022. Crown."
"35931050","Multi-ancestry fine-mapping improves precision to identify causal genes in transcriptome-wide association studies.","Am J Hum Genet","Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWASs) are a powerful approach to identify genes whose expression is associated with complex disease risk. However, non-causal genes can exhibit association signals due to confounding by linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns and eQTL pleiotropy at genomic risk regions, which necessitates fine-mapping of TWAS signals. Here, we present MA-FOCUS, a multi-ancestry framework for the improved identification of genes underlying traits of interest. We demonstrate that by leveraging differences in ancestry-specific patterns of LD and eQTL signals, MA-FOCUS consistently outperforms single-ancestry fine-mapping approaches with equivalent total sample sizes across multiple metrics. We perform TWASs for 15 blood traits using genome-wide summary statistics (average nEA = 511 k, nAA = 13 k) and lymphoblastoid cell line eQTL data from cohorts of primarily European and African continental ancestries. We recapitulate evidence demonstrating shared genetic architectures for eQTL and blood traits between the two ancestry groups and observe that gene-level effects correlate 20% more strongly across ancestries than SNP-level effects. Lastly, we perform fine-mapping using MA-FOCUS and find evidence that genes at TWAS risk regions are more likely to be shared across ancestries than they are to be ancestry specific. Using multiple lines of evidence to validate our findings, we find that gene sets produced by MA-FOCUS are more enriched in hematopoietic categories than alternative approaches (p = 2.36 × 10-15). Our work demonstrates that including and appropriately accounting for genetic diversity can drive more profound insights into the genetic architecture of complex traits.Copyright © 2022 American Society of Human Genetics.

Chronotype, which represents individual preferences for activity and performance, is associated with human health issues, particularly psychiatric disorders. This narrative review, which focuses on the relationship between chronotype and mental disorders, provides an insight into the potential mechanism. Recent evidence indicates that (1) the evening chronotype is a risk factor for depressive disorders and substance use disorders, whereas the morning chronotype is a protective factor. (2) Evening chronotype individuals with bipolar disorder tend to have more severe symptoms and comorbidities. (3) The evening chronotype is only related to anxiety symptoms.

Systemic low-grade inflammation associated with PSD has been shown to occur at several months to years, however, whether these inflammatory markers predicted PSD at an acute stage of stroke is controversial.A total of 625 patients with acute ischemic stroke (219 female, 35.40%) were included in this study. PSD was diagnosed using the 17-item Hamilton depression scale (HAMD) at 7 days following discharge (7-14 days after stroke onset). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was applied to build a prediction model for PSD at discharge. Discrimination and calibration of the model were assessed by C-index, calibration plot. Internal validation was conducted using bootstrapping validation.At discharge of hospitalization, 95 patients (15.20%) were diagnosed with PSD. Multivariable logistic regression suggested that female gender (OR = 2.043, 95% CI = 1.287-3.245,p= 0.002), baseline NIHSS (OR = 1.108, 95% CI = 1.055-1.165,p&lt; 0.001) and fibrinogen (OR = 1.388, 95% CI = 1.129-1.706,p= 0.002) were independent predictors for PSD at discharge. The cut-off of the fibrinogen plasma level was 3.08 g/L. These predictors were included in the nomogram. The model displayed good discrimination, with a C-index of 0.730 (95% CI = 0.683-0.777) and good calibration.Female gender, baseline stroke severity and a higher level of fibrinogen were independently associated with PSD at discharge.

Meningeal lymphatics are essential for drainage of molecules in the cerebrospinal fluid to the peripheral immune system. Their potential role in depression-like behaviour has not been investigated. Here, we show in mice, sub-chronic variable stress as a model of depression-like behaviour impairs meningeal lymphatics in females but not in males. Manipulations of meningeal lymphatics regulate the sex difference in the susceptibility to stress-induced depression- and anxiety-like behaviors in mice, as well as alterations of the medial prefrontal cortex and the ventral tegmental area, brain regions critical for emotional regulation. Together, our findings suggest meningeal lymphatic impairment contributes to susceptibility to stress in mice, and that restoration of the meningeal lymphatics might have potential for modulation of depression-like behaviour.© 2022.

In this work, we considered the epigenetic analog of PRS, methylation risk scores (MRS), a linear combination of methylation states. We measured methylation across a large cohort (n = 831) of diverse samples in the UCLA Health biobank, for which both genetic and complete EHR data are available. We constructed MRS for 607 phenotypes spanning diagnoses, clinical lab tests, and medication prescriptions. When added to a baseline set of predictive features, MRS significantly improved the imputation of 139 outcomes, whereas the PRS improved only 22 (median improvement for methylation 10.74%, 141.52%, and 15.46% in medications, labs, and diagnosis codes, respectively, whereas genotypes only improved the labs at a median increase of 18.42%). We added significant MRS to state-of-the-art EHR imputation methods that leverage the entire set of medical records, and found that including MRS as a medical feature in the algorithm significantly improves EHR imputation in 37% of lab tests examined (median R2increase 47.6%). Finally, we replicated several MRS in multiple external studies of methylation (minimum p-value of 2.72 × 10-7) and replicated 22 of 30 tested MRS internally in two separate cohorts of different ethnicity.

"36012914","Effect of a 3-Week Multidisciplinary Body Weight Reduction Program on the Epigenetic Age Acceleration in Obese Adults.","J Clin Med","Obesity and aging share common molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), which occur frequently in both conditions. DNA methylation (DNAm) age, a biomarker of the epigenetic clock, has been proposed as a more accurate predictor of biological aging than chronological age. A positive difference between an individual's chronological age and DNAm age is referred to as epigenetic age acceleration. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of a 3-week in-hospital body weight reduction program (BWRP) on the epigenetic age acceleration, as well as on other cardiometabolic outcomes, in a cohort of 72 obese adults (F/M: 43/29; (chronological) age: 51.5 ± 14.5 yrs; BMI: 46.5 ± 6.3 kg/m2). At the end of the BWRP, when considering the entire population, BMI decreased, and changes in body composition were observed. The BWRP also produced beneficial metabolic effects as demonstrated by decreases in glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol. A post-BWRP improvement in cardiovascular function was also evident (i.e., decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressures and heart rate). The BWRP reduced some markers of systemic inflammation, particularly C-reactive protein (CRP). Finally, vascular age (VA) and Framingham risk score (FRS) were reduced after the BWRP. When considering the entire population, DNAm age and epigenetic age acceleration did not differ after the BWRP. However, when subdividing the population into two groups based on each subject's epigenetic age acceleration (i.e., ≤0 yrs or &gt;0 yrs), the BWRP reduced the epigenetic age acceleration only in obese subjects with a value &gt; 0 yrs (thus biologically older than expected). Among all the single demographic, lifestyle, biochemical, and clinical characteristics investigated, only some markers of systemic inflammation, such as CRP, were associated with the epigenetic age acceleration. Moreover, chronological age was correlated with DNAm age and VA; finally, there was a correlation between DNAm age and VA. In conclusion, a 3-week BWRP is capable of reducing the epigenetic age acceleration in obese adults, being the BWRP-induced rejuvenation evident in subjects with an epigenetic age acceleration &gt; 0 yrs. Based on the BWRP-induced decrease in CRP levels, chronic systemic inflammation seems to play a role in mediating obesity-related epigenetic remodeling and biological aging. Thus, due to the strong association of CVD risk with the epigenetic clock and morbidity/mortality, any effort should be made to reduce the low-grade chronic inflammatory state in obesity."
"36006936","Alu hypomethylation in naturally and surgically postmenopausal women; a cross-sectional study.","PLoS One","Menopause, which may accelerate the hallmarks of the natural aging process, represents a point in time characterized by the permanent cessation of menstruation following the loss of ovarian estrogen production. Unlike natural menopause, which is characterized by a gradual decrease in estrogen production, when both ovaries are removed before the natural age of menopause, the onset of estrogen deprivation is abrupt. Further, a decrease in genome methylation frequently occurs in aging cells, and the major interspersed repetitive DNA elements in humans are Alu elements. In blood cells, Alu demethylation starts at an age of approximately 40 years, and increases with age. Here, we explored the Alu methylation levels corresponding to age-matched pre-menopausal, naturally postmenopausal, and surgically postmenopausal women aged 45-55 years (n = 60 in each group). Our results indicated that the body mass index (BMI), time-since-menopause, and Alu methylation levels corresponding to the three groups were significantly different. However, no correlations between Alu methylation level and BMI, time-since-menopause, or age were observed. Additionally, the Alu methylation level corresponding to the natural post-menopause group was significantly lower those corresponding to the pre-menopausal (p = 0.001) and surgical post-menopausal (p = 0.037) groups. In conclusion, Alu hypomethylation occurs in naturally postmenopausal women, implying that when women reach the age of natural menopause, the cell aging process may progress significantly with genome hypomethylation. These findings, notwithstanding, further studies are necessary to clarify whether bilateral oophorectomy before the age of menopause affects the cell aging process to a greater extent than natural menopause, and whether estrogen therapy or other interventions can delay cell aging in this regard."

Unlike changes to DNA sequence, epigenetic signatures are dynamic and reversible, creating an opportunity for not only therapeutic targets but may serve as biomarkers to follow disease course and identify molecular subtypes in heterogeneous diseases such as asthma. In this review, we will examine the relationship between asthma and 3 key epigenetic processes that modify gene expression: DNA methylation, modification of histone tails, and noncoding RNAs.

In this study, we integrated multiple omics data to construct the regulated pathway of rs11136000-CLU-AD. In step 1, we investigated the effects of variant rs11136000 on AD risk with different genders and diagnostic methods using GWAS summary statistics for AD from International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) and UK Biobank. In step 2, we assessed the regulation of rs11136000 onCLUexpression in AD brain samples from Mayo clinic and controls from Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx). In step 3, we investigated the differential gene/protein expression ofCLUin AD and controls from four large cohorts. The results showed that rs11136000 T allele reduced AD risk in either clinically diagnosed or proxy AD patients. By using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis, rs11136000 variant downregulatedCLUexpression in 13 normal brain tissues, but upregulatedCLUexpression in cerebellum and temporal cortex of AD samples. Importantly,CLUwas significantly differentially expressed in temporal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior prefrontal cortex of AD patients compared with normal controls.

"35959022","Restlessness and an Increased Urge to Move (Drive for Activity) in Anorexia Nervosa May Strengthen Personal Motivation to Maintain Caloric Restriction and May Augment Body Awareness and Proprioception: A Lesson From Leptin Administration in Anorexia Nervosa.","Front Psychol","Anorexia nervosa (AN), a disorder of voluntary food restriction leading to severe weight loss in female adolescents, remains an enigma. In particular, the appropriation of the starved thin body into the self-concept in AN is a process insufficiently researched and still poorly understood. Healthy humans undergoing starvation experience a slowing of movements and avoid voluntary exercise. By contrast, AN tends to be not infrequently associated with voluntary, sometimes excessive and/or compulsive exercise. Such deliberate exercise, not reported in starvation, seems to be facilitated by an increased urge for movement and physical restlessness, particular to AN. The increased urge to move would reflect spontaneous daily activity, the energy expended for everything that is not sleeping, eating, or voluntary exercise. Our hypothesis is that the starvation-induced increased urge to move and restlessness may promote the development of AN. Reversal of the fasting state, by either high caloric food or by leptin administration, would be expected to reduce restlessness and the increased urge to move along with improvement in other symptoms in AN. This review explores the idea that such restless activation in AN, in itself and through accelerating body weight loss, might foster the integration of the starving body into the self-concept by (1) enhancing the person's sense of self-control and sense of achievement and (2) through invigorating proprioception and through intensifying the perception of the changing body shape. (3) Tentative evidence from studies piloting leptin administration in chronic AN patients which support this hypothesis is reviewed. The findings show that short term administration of high doses of leptin indeed mitigated depressive feelings, inner tension, intrusive thoughts of food, and the increased urge to be physically active, easing the way to recovery, yet had little influence on the patients' personal commitment to remain at a low weight. Full recovery then requires resolution of the individuals' personal unresolved psychological conflicts through psychotherapy and frequently needs specialized treatment approaches to address psychiatric co-morbidities. AN might be conceptualized as a hereditary form of starvation resistance, facilitated by the effects of starvation on fitness allowing for an exceptionally intense personal commitment to perpetuate food restriction.Copyright © 2022 Casper."
"35948596","Peripheral gene interactions define interpretable clusters of core ASD genes in a network-based investigation of the omnigenic theory.","NPJ Syst Biol Appl","According to the recently proposed omnigenic theory, all expressed genes in a relevant tissue are contributing directly or indirectly to the manifestation of complex disorders such as autism. Thus, holistic approaches can be complementary in studying genetics of these complex disorders to focusing on a limited number of candidate genes. Gene interaction networks can be used for holistic studies of the omnigenic nature of autism. We used Louvain clustering on tissue-specific gene interaction networks and their subgraphs exclusively containing autism-related genes to study the effects of peripheral gene interactions. We observed that the autism gene clusters are significantly weaker connected to each other and the peripheral genes in non-neuronal tissues than in brain-related tissues. The biological functions of the brain clusters correlated well with previous findings on autism, such as synaptic signaling, regulation of DNA methylation, or regulation of lymphocyte activation, however, on the other tissues they did not enrich as significantly. Furthermore, ASD subjects with disruptive mutations in specific gene clusters show phenotypical differences compared to other disruptive variants carrying ASD individuals. Our results strengthen the omnigenic theory and can advance our understanding of the genetic background of autism.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35921104","Exploring Links Between Psychosis and Frontotemporal Dementia Using Multimodal Machine Learning: Dementia Praecox Revisited.","JAMA Psychiatry","The behavioral and cognitive symptoms of severe psychotic disorders overlap with those seen in dementia. However, shared brain alterations remain disputed, and their relevance for patients in at-risk disease stages has not been explored so far.To use machine learning to compare the expression of structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) patterns of behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), Alzheimer disease (AD), and schizophrenia; estimate predictability in patients with bvFTD and schizophrenia based on sociodemographic, clinical, and biological data; and examine prognostic value, genetic underpinnings, and progression in patients with clinical high-risk (CHR) states for psychosis or recent-onset depression (ROD).This study included 1870 individuals from 5 cohorts, including (1) patients with bvFTD (n = 108), established AD (n = 44), mild cognitive impairment or early-stage AD (n = 96), schizophrenia (n = 157), or major depression (n = 102) to derive and compare diagnostic patterns and (2) patients with CHR (n = 160) or ROD (n = 161) to test patterns' prognostic relevance and progression. Healthy individuals (n = 1042) were used for age-related and cohort-related data calibration. Data were collected from January 1996 to July 2019 and analyzed between April 2020 and April 2022.Case assignments based on diagnostic patterns; sociodemographic, clinical, and biological data; 2-year functional outcomes and genetic separability of patients with CHR and ROD with high vs low pattern expression; and pattern progression from baseline to follow-up MRI scans in patients with nonrecovery vs preserved recovery.Of 1870 included patients, 902 (48.2%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 38.0 (19.3) years. The bvFTD pattern comprising prefrontal, insular, and limbic volume reductions was more expressed in patients with schizophrenia (65 of 157 [41.2%]) and major depression (22 of 102 [21.6%]) than the temporo-limbic AD patterns (28 of 157 [17.8%] and 3 of 102 [2.9%], respectively). bvFTD expression was predicted by high body mass index, psychomotor slowing, affective disinhibition, and paranoid ideation (R2 = 0.11). The schizophrenia pattern was expressed in 92 of 108 patients (85.5%) with bvFTD and was linked to the C9orf72 variant, oligoclonal banding in the cerebrospinal fluid, cognitive impairment, and younger age (R2 = 0.29). bvFTD and schizophrenia pattern expressions forecasted 2-year psychosocial impairments in patients with CHR and were predicted by polygenic risk scores for frontotemporal dementia, AD, and schizophrenia. Findings were not associated with AD or accelerated brain aging. Finally, 1-year bvFTD/schizophrenia pattern progression distinguished patients with nonrecovery from those with preserved recovery.Neurobiological links may exist between bvFTD and psychosis focusing on prefrontal and salience system alterations. Further transdiagnostic investigations are needed to identify shared pathophysiological processes underlying the neuroanatomical interface between the 2 disease spectra."

Both immune and structural cells contribute to aortic degeneration, however, gene specific alterations in these cellular subsets are poorly understood.We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of AAAs and control tissues. AAA-related changes were examined by comparing gene expression profiles as well as detailed receptor-ligand interactions. An integrative analysis of scRNA-seq data with large genome-wide association study data was conducted to identify genes critical for AAA development.Using scRNA-seq we provide the first comprehensive characterization of the cellular landscape in human AAA tissues. Unbiased clustering analysis of transcriptional profiles identified seventeen clusters representing 8 cell lineages. For immune cells, clustering analysis identified 4 T-cell and 5 monocyte/macrophage subpopulations, with distinct transcriptional profiles in AAAs compared to controls. Gene enrichment analysis on immune subsets identified multiple pathways only expressed in AAA tissue, including those involved in mitochondrial dysfunction, proliferation, and cytokine secretion. Moreover, receptor-ligand analysis defined robust interactions between vascular smooth muscle cells and myeloid populations in AAA tissues. Lastly, integrated analysis of scRNA-seq data with genome-wide association study studies determined that vascular smooth muscle cell expression of SORT1 is critical for maintaining normal aortic wall function.Here we provide the first comprehensive evaluation of single-cell composition of the abdominal aortic wall and reveal how the gene expression landscape is altered in human AAAs.Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Recent studies have proposed that LDAEP is also influenced by dopaminergic activity. Evidence shows attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms are associated with dopamine dysfunction. This study aimed to evaluate the relation between ADHD symptoms and LDAEP, as well as medication-mediated changes of LDAEP.A total of 38 male children (6-12 years old) with ADHD were analyzed in this study. Symptom severity was assessed using the ADHD rating scale (ARS) and the continuous performance test. To determine LDAEP, the auditory event-related potential was evaluated before medication. Changes in LDAEP were measured after 12 weeks of treatment with methylphenidate.The subjects had a mean age of 9.24 ± 1.74 years with an average IQ of 109.4 ± 13.8. Before pharmacological treatment with methylphenidate, LDAEP was positively associated with the ARS score after adjusting for age and IQ (r = 0.592,p= 0.005). LDAEP was correlated with inattention (r = 0.522,p= 0.015) and hyperactivity-impulsivity (r = 0.6,p= 0.004). However, the LDAEP of 15 subjects decreased following methylphenidate treatment (Z = -1.988,p= 0.047).In boys with ADHD, LDAEP appears to be associated with symptom severity. LDAEP showed a significant association with impulsivity and inattention. Importantly, LDAEP was shown to decrease after drug treatment. Our findings support the utility of LDAEP as a noninvasive and clinically useful method to assess symptom severity in children with ADHD."

We establish a landscape theory for cell differentiation with proliferation effect, in which the developmental process is modeled as a stochastic dynamical system with a birth-death term. We find that two different energy landscapes, denotedUandV, collectively contribute to the establishment of non-equilibrium steady differentiation. The potentialUis known as the energy landscape leading to the steady distribution, whose metastable states stand for cell types, whileVindicates the differentiation direction from pluripotent to differentiated cells. This interpretation of cell differentiation is different from the previous landscape theory without the proliferation effect. We propose feasible numerical methods and a mean-field approximation for constructing landscapesUandV.

Therefore, we performed an acute hypoxic treatment (dissolved oxygen at 2.07 ± 0.08 mg/L) on Japanese flounder. It was confirmed that the hypoxic stress affected the physiological phenotype through changes in blood physiology (RBC, HGB, WBC), biochemistry (LDH, ALP, ALT, GLU, TC, TG, ALB), and hormone (cortisol) indicators. Hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), an essential oxygen homeostasis mediator in organisms consisting of an inducible HIF-1α and a constitutive HIF-1β, and its target geneLDH-Awere deeply studied. Results showed thatHIF-1αandLDH-Agenes were co-expressed and significantly affected by hypoxic stress. The dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed that transcription factor HIF-1 transcriptionally regulated theLDH-Agene, and its transcription binding sequence was GGACGTGA located at -2343~-2336. The DNA methylation status ofHIF-1αandLDH-Agenes were detected to understand the mechanism of environmental stress on genes. It was found that hypoxia affected theHIF-1αgene andLDH-Agene methylation levels. The study uncovered HIF-1/LDH-A signaling pathway responsive mechanisms of Japanese flounder to hypoxia in epigenetic modification and transcriptional regulation.

"35904814","TET1 regulates gene expression and repression of endogenous retroviruses independent of DNA demethylation.","Nucleic Acids Res","DNA methylation (5-methylcytosine (5mC)) is critical for genome stability and transcriptional regulation in mammals. The discovery that ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins catalyze the oxidation of 5mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC), and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) revolutionized our perspective on the complexity and regulation of DNA modifications. However, to what extent the regulatory functions of TET1 can be attributed to its catalytic activity remains unclear. Here, we use genome engineering and quantitative multi-omics approaches to dissect the precise catalytic vs. non-catalytic functions of TET1 in murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Our study identifies TET1 as an essential interaction hub for multiple chromatin modifying complexes and a global regulator of histone modifications. Strikingly, we find that the majority of transcriptional regulation depends on non-catalytic functions of TET1. In particular, we show that TET1 is critical for the establishment of H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 at endogenous retroviral elements (ERVs) and their silencing that is independent of its canonical role in DNA demethylation. Furthermore, we provide evidence that this repression of ERVs depends on the interaction between TET1 and SIN3A. In summary, we demonstrate that the non-catalytic functions of TET1 are critical for regulation of gene expression and the silencing of endogenous retroviruses in mESCs.© The Author(s) 2022.

Gender, age, WBC count, and fasting blood glucose (FBG) were obtained from Al-Borg Medical Laboratories for 14,205 subjects. Means, prevalence, risk measures, and the diagnostic accuracy of elevated NLR and hyperglycemia (HG) were evaluated. Subjects with elevated NLR (&gt;3) had significantly higher FBG (105.10 ± 0.33 vs. 114.0 ± 2.81) and NLR was significantly elevated in impaired fasting glycemia (IFG; 1.21 ± 0.01 vs. 1.25 ± 0.01) and HG (1.21 ± 0.01 vs. 1.39 ± 0.02). Elevations of NLR in HG but not in IFG persisted across all age groups except young males and elderly females. The prevalence of elevated NLR in hyperglycemic subjects was 4.12% compared to 2.16% in subjects with normal FBG.

Patients who were admitted to Bedford Hospital from March-July 2020 and had a positive swab for COVID were selected for this study. Clinical and laboratory data were collected using ICE system. Multiple haematological and biochemistry biomarkers were analysed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression to predict intensive therapy unit (ITU) admission and/or survival based on admission tests. Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and C-reactive protein were elevated in most patients, irrespective of ITU status, representing a common outcome of COVID-19. This was driven by lymphopenia in 80% and neutrophilia in 42% of all patients. Multivariate logistic regression identified an increase in mortality associated with greater age, elevated NLR, alkaline phosphatase activity and hyperkalaemia. With the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.706 +/- 0.04117, negative predictive value (NPV) 66.7% and positive predictive value (PPV) 64.9%.

Tumorigenesis is attributed to many factors, including gene mutations and tumor microenvironment. Mitochondria and epigenetics play essential roles in tumor initiation, evolution, metastasis, and recurrence. Targeting mitochondrial metabolism and epigenetics are promising therapeutic strategies for tumor treatment. In this review, we summarize the roles of mitochondria in key metabolites required for epigenetics modification and in cell fate regulation and discuss the current strategy in cancer therapies via targeting epigenetic modifiers and related enzymes in metabolic regulation.

"35954191","Roles of Epigenetics in Cardiac Fibroblast Activation and Fibrosis.","Cells","Cardiac fibrosis is a common pathophysiologic process associated with numerous cardiovascular diseases, resulting in cardiac dysfunction. Cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) play an important role in the production of the extracellular matrix and are the essential cell type in a quiescent state in a healthy heart. In response to diverse pathologic stress and environmental stress, resident CFs convert to activated fibroblasts, referred to as myofibroblasts, which produce more extracellular matrix, contributing to cardiac fibrosis. Although multiple molecular mechanisms are implicated in CFs activation and cardiac fibrosis, there is increasing evidence that epigenetic regulation plays a key role in this process. Epigenetics is a rapidly growing field in biology, and provides a modulated link between pathological stimuli and gene expression profiles, ultimately leading to corresponding pathological changes. Epigenetic modifications are mainly composed of three main categories: DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs. This review focuses on recent advances regarding epigenetic regulation in cardiac fibrosis and highlights the effects of epigenetic modifications on CFs activation. Finally, we provide some perspectives and prospects for the study of epigenetic modifications and cardiac fibrosis."

Disease onset or pathological conditions that lead to increased cell death alter the contribution of different tissues to the total pool of cfDNA. Because cfDNA molecules retain cell-type specific epigenetic features, it is possible to infer tissue-of-origin from epigenetic characteristics. Recent research efforts demonstrated that analysis of, e.g., methylation patterns, nucleosome occupancy, and fragmentomics determined the cell- or tissue-of-origin of individual cfDNA molecules. This novel tissue-of origin-analysis enables to estimate the contributions of different tissues to the total cfDNA pool in body fluids and find tissues with increased cell death (pathologic condition), expanding the portfolio of liquid biopsies towards a wide range of pathologies and early diagnosis.

In the process of measuring cell population proportions, traditional experimental methods have been greatly hampered by the cost and extensive dropout events. At present, the public availability of large amounts of DNA methylation data makes it possible to use computational methods to predict proportions.In this paper, we proposed PRMeth, a method to deconvolve tumor mixtures using partially available DNA methylation data. By adopting an iteratively optimized non-negative matrix factorization framework, PRMeth took DNA methylation profiles of a portion of the cell types in the tissue mixtures (including blood and solid tumors) as input to estimate the proportions of all cell types as well as the methylation profiles of unknown cell types simultaneously. We compared PRMeth with five different methods through three benchmark datasets and the results show that PRMeth could infer the proportions of all cell types and recover the methylation profiles of unknown cell types effectively. Then, applying PRMeth to four types of tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, we found that the immune cell proportions estimated by PRMeth were largely consistent with previous studies and met biological significance.Our method can circumvent the difficulty of obtaining complete DNA methylation reference data and obtain satisfactory deconvolution accuracy, which will be conducive to exploring the new directions of cancer immunotherapy.

"35955511","Methyl Group Metabolism in Differentiation, Aging, and Cancer.","Int J Mol Sci","Methyl group metabolism belongs to a relatively understudied field of research. Its importance lies in the fact that methyl group metabolic pathways are crucial for the successful conversion of dietary nutrients into the basic building blocks to carry out any cellular methylation reaction. Methyl groups play essential roles in numerous cellular functions such as DNA methylation, nucleotide- and protein biosynthesis. Especially, DNA methylation is responsible for organizing the genome into transcriptionally silent and active regions. Ultimately, it is this proper annotation that determines the quality of expression patterns required to ensure and shape the phenotypic integrity and function of a highly specialized cell type. Life is characterized by constantly changing environmental conditions, which are addressed by changes in DNA methylation. This relationship is increasingly coming into focus as it is of fundamental importance for differentiation, aging, and cancer. The stability and permanence of these metabolic processes, fueling the supplementation of methyl groups, seem to be important criteria to prevent deficiencies and erosion of the methylome. Alterations in the metabolic processes can lead to epigenetic and genetic perturbations, causative for diverse disorders, accelerated aging, and various age-related diseases. In recent decades, the intake of methyl group compounds has changed significantly due to, e.g., environmental pollution and food additives. Based on the current knowledge, this review provides a brief overview of the highly interconnected relationship between nutrition, metabolism, changes in epigenetic modifications, cancer, and aging. One goal is to provide an impetus to additionally investigate changes in DNA methylation as a possible consequence of an impaired methyl group metabolism."

This complex entity is the result of the interplay between biological, psychological, and sociocultural factors, and compelling evidence suggests that MDD can be considered a disease that occurs as a consequence of an evolutionary mismatch and unhealthy lifestyle habits. In this context, diet is one of the core pillars of health, influencing multiple biological processes in the brain and the entire body. It seems that there is a bidirectional relationship between MDD and malnutrition, and depressed individuals often lack certain critical nutrients along with an aberrant dietary pattern. Thus, dietary interventions are one of the most promising tools to explore in the field of MDD, as there are a specific group of nutrients (i.e., omega 3, vitamins, polyphenols, and caffeine), foods (fish, nuts, seeds fruits, vegetables, coffee/tea, and fermented products) or dietary supplements (such as S-adenosylmethionine, acetyl carnitine, creatine, amino acids, etc.), which are being currently studied. Likewise, the entire nutritional context and the dietary pattern seem to be another potential area of study, and some strategies such as the Mediterranean diet have demonstrated some relevant benefits in patients with MDD; although, further efforts are still needed. In the present work, we will explore the state-of-the-art diet in the prevention and clinical support of MDD, focusing on the biological properties of its main nutrients, foods, and dietary patterns and their possible implications for these patients."

PRS attained average predictionR2s of 5.8%, 4.0%, and 0.53% in non-British Europeans, South Asians, and Africans, confirming poor cross-population transferability. In contrast, PRS-FH attained average predictionR2s of 13%, 12%, and 10%, respectively, representing a large improvement in Europeans and an extremely large improvement in Africans. In conclusion, including family history improves the accuracy of polygenic risk scores, particularly in diverse populations."

We used data from UK biobank (N = 342,846) to evaluate joint effect of breastfeeding and maternal smoke during pregnancy (MSDP) on seven adult offspring mental health outcomes (self-reported depression, depression score, self-reported anxiety, anxiety score, neuroticism score, self-harm, suicide). We stratified individuals to MSDP group and non-MSDP group as well as breastfeeding group and non-breastfeeding group. Multiple linear regression and logistic regressions analysis were performed between independent variables (MSDP or breastfeeding) and dependent variables separately (seven mental health outcomes) in each stratum. Effect estimates were expressed as β values and OR values. Sex, age, 10 principle components of population structure, smoking, alcohol use, and Townsend deprivation index were examined as covariates. At MSDP grouping level, coefficients (odds ratio [OR]) for association of breastfed as a baby with self-reported anxiety (category variable) were 0.87 (95%CI, (0.82-0.93), P = 1.74 × 10-5) in the MSDP group and 0.83 (95%CI, (0.79-0.87), P = 2.76 × 10-17) in the non-MSDP group. At breastfeeding grouping level, OR for association of MSDP and self-reported anxiety were 1.15 (95%CI, (1.10-1.20), P = 5.36 × 10-11) in breastfeeding group and 1.12(95%CI, (1.06-1.20), P = 2.02 × 10-4) in non-breastfeeding group. At MSDP grouping level, negatively associations were found for breastfeeding and anxiety score (continuable variable) in MSDP group (-0.04 SD change per SD change in MSDP, 95% CI, (- 0.06, - 0.02), P = 2.42 × 10-3) and non-MSDP group (-0.06 SD change per SD change in MSDP, 95%CI, (- 0.07, - 0.04), P = 1.70 × 10-11). At breastfeeding grouping level, positive association was found for MSDP and anxiety score in the breastfeeding group (0.07 SD change per SD change in MSDP, 95%CI, (0.06-0.09), P = 1.49 × 10-20) and non-breastfeeding group (0.07 SD change per SD change in MSDP, 95%CI, (0.05-0.09), P = 7.19 × 10-8). Compared with non-MSDP group, the protective effect (reflected by coefficients) of breastfeeding on anxiety in the MSDP decreased. Our preliminary study found MSDP may lower the protective effect of breastfeeding on the adult offspring anxiety, depression and neuroticism, providing useful recommendations for health care service via quitting smoking during pregnancy and encouraging prolonged breastfeeding.© 2022.

"36012253","Studying Chromatin Epigenetics with Fluorescence Microscopy.","Int J Mol Sci","Epigenetic modifications of histones (methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, etc.) are of great importance in determining the functional state of chromatin. Changes in epigenome underlay all basic biological processes, such as cell division, differentiation, aging, and cancerous transformation. Post-translational histone modifications are mainly studied by immunoprecipitation with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq). It enables an accurate profiling of target modifications along the genome, but suffers from the high cost of analysis and the inability to work with living cells. Fluorescence microscopy represents an attractive complementary approach to characterize epigenetics. It can be applied to both live and fixed cells, easily compatible with high-throughput screening, and provide access to rich spatial information down to the single cell level. In this review, we discuss various fluorescent probes for histone modification detection. Various types of live-cell imaging epigenetic sensors suitable for conventional as well as super-resolution fluorescence microscopy are described. We also focus on problems and future perspectives in the development of fluorescent probes for epigenetics."
"35955838","The Roles of Histone Post-Translational Modifications in the Formation and Function of a Mitotic Chromosome.","Int J Mol Sci","During mitosis, many cellular structures are organized to segregate the replicated genome to the daughter cells. Chromatin is condensed to shape a mitotic chromosome. A multiprotein complex known as kinetochore is organized on a specific region of each chromosome, the centromere, which is defined by the presence of a histone H3 variant called CENP-A. The cytoskeleton is re-arranged to give rise to the mitotic spindle that binds to kinetochores and leads to the movement of chromosomes. How chromatin regulates different activities during mitosis is not well known. The role of histone post-translational modifications (HPTMs) in mitosis has been recently revealed. Specific HPTMs participate in local compaction during chromosome condensation. On the other hand, HPTMs are involved in CENP-A incorporation in the centromere region, an essential activity to maintain centromere identity. HPTMs also participate in the formation of regulatory protein complexes, such as the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) and the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). Finally, we discuss how HPTMs can be modified by environmental factors and the possible consequences on chromosome segregation and genome stability."

Genomic studies have unveiled several promising targets in this disease, including fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) fusions and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations. To fully harness the potential of genomically informed therapies in CCA, it is necessary to thoroughly characterize the available model organisms, including cell lines. One parameter to investigate in CCA is homologous recombination deficiency (HRD). While mutations in homologous recombinational repair (HRR)-related genes have been detected, their predictive value remains undetermined. Using a targeted next-generation sequencing approach, we analyzed 12 human CCA cell lines and compared them to 62 CCA samples of the molecular tumor board cohort. The AmoyDx®HRD Focus Panel was employed to determine corresponding genomic scar scores (GSS). Ten of twelve cell lines harbored alterations in common HRR-related genes, and five cell lines were HRD-positive, although this parameter did not correlate well with Olaparib sensitivity. Moreover, functionally relevantAPCandβ-cateninmutations were registered, which were also detected in 4/176 (2.3%) samples on a CCA microarray. Although rare, these alterations were exclusive to large duct type CCA with associated intraductal papillary neoplasms of the bile duct (IPNB) in 3 cases, pointing at a distinct form of cholangiocarcinogenesis with potential specific vulnerabilities."

Differences between genders in basic characteristics, clinical symptoms, comorbidities, and tumor parameters were analyzed.There was no significant difference in females and males, however, moderately higher for females (52.8% vs. 47.2%), with the largest subgroup being 40~60 years of age (54.9%). Age at onset (P=0.002) and age at diagnosis (P=0.005) were both younger in females compared to males. Males lived more in urban areas and females lived more in rural areas (P=0.047). The proportion of smokers and alcohol drinkers was significantly higher in males than in females (P < 0.001). Non-functional pNENs were more frequent in males and functional pNENs in females (P=0.032). In women, functional status of the tumor was significantly associated with metastatic outcome (P=0.007) and functional tumors proved to be a protective factor compared to non-functional tumors (OR=0.090,95% CI: 0.011~ 0.752). There were no gender differences in tumor size, location, grade, stage or prognosis.Gender differences in some clinicopathological features, and distant metastasis in patients with pNENs were identified, which suggested certain management details that justified emphasis based on gender.Copyright © 2022 Fu, Yu, Yang, Chen, Chen, Hu and Sun."

"36009501","DNA Hypomethylation as a Potential Link between Excessive Alcohol Intake and Cardiometabolic Dysfunction in Morbidly Obese Adults.","Biomedicines","A large percentage of obese patients in the United States suffer a comorbid substance use disorder, mainly alcohol use. Alcohol consumption interferes with the absorption of dietary methyl donors such as folate required for the one-carbon metabolism pathway and subsequently for DNA methylation. In this study, we assessed the association between alcohol consumption and DNA methylation in obese subjects. We obtained visceral adipose tissue (VAT) biopsies from bariatric patients. DNA methylation of 94 genes implicated in inflammation and immunity were analyzed in VAT in relation to alcohol consumption data obtained via questionnaires. Vasoreactivity was measured in the brachial artery and the VAT-isolated arterioles. Pro-inflammatory genes were significantly hypomethylated in the heavy drinking category correlating with higher levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines. Alcohol consumption correlated positively with body mass index (BMI), fat percentage, insulin resistance, impaired lipid profile, and systemic inflammation and negatively with plasma folate and vitamin B12, inflammatory gene DNA methylation, and vasoreactivity. In conclusion, these data suggest that alcohol intake is associated with lower DNA methylation and higher inflammation and cardiometabolic risk in obese individuals."

This condition may induce long-lasting pathophysiological effects on either fetal or infant health that could be attributable to unknown unique changes in the umbilical blood composition.A total of 34 overweight/obese and 32 normal-weight pregnant women were recruited. Fifteen umbilical blood samples including 8 overweight/obese subjects and 7 normal weight women were sequenced using Targeted Bisulfite Sequencing technology to detect the average methylation level of cytosine and identify the differentially methylated region (DMR). GO and KEGG analyses were then employed to perform pathway enrichment analysis of DMR-related genes and promoters. Moreover, the mRNA levels of methylation-related genes histone deacetylases (HDACs) and DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) were characterized in the samples obtained from these two groups.Average methylated cytosine levels in both the CpG islands (CGI) and promoter significantly decreased in overweight/obese groups. A total of 1669 DMRs exhibited differences in their DNA methylation status between the overweight/obese and control groups. GO and KEGG analyses revealed that DMR-related genes and promoters were enriched in the metabolism, cancer and cardiomyopathy signaling pathways. Furthermore, the HDACs and DNMTs mRNA levels trended to decline in overweight/obese groups.Decreased methylated cytosine levels in overweight/obese women induce the gene expression activity at a higher level than in the control group. DMRs between these two groups in the fetal blood may contribute to the changes in gene transcription that underlie the increased risk of metabolic disorders, cancers and cardiomyopathy in their offspring.© 2022.

A potential mechanism by which stress affects healthspan and lifespan is acceleration of cellular aging. Biologic age prediction models, termed epigenetic clocks, have been developed to estimate biologic age differences among people with the same chronologic age. This study evaluates the simultaneous impact of perceived chronic stress and resilience on Grim Age acceleration. The perceived stress score (PSS) and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) were used to measure chronic stress and resilience, respectively. DNA was extracted from whole blood and analyzed using the MethylationEPIC BeadChip. GrimAge estimates were calculated using the methylation age calculator. Forty-seven business executives were categorized by levels of high or low stress and resilience scores. Compared to participants with low stress and high resilience, those with low stress and low resilience demonstrated the strongest association with Grim Age acceleration (p = 0.044), after controlling for age and estimated cellular proportions. Interestingly, among participants with low resilience, those with high perceived stress had a weaker association with Grim Age acceleration than participants with low perceived stress. However, among participants with high resilience, low perceived stress had a weaker association with Grim Age acceleration than high perceived stress. Our findings suggest that the impact of perceived stress on epigenetic age acceleration may differ based on resilience capacity, with a potential paradoxical beneficial effect among those with low resilience.© 2022.

Lifestyle factors, such as smoking, alcohol, exercise, and diet, were controlled.We identified 2,912 differentially methylated CpG sites in patients with RO psychosis compared to controls. Most of the genes associated with the top 20 differentially methylated sites had not been reported in previous methylation studies and were involved in apoptosis, autophagy, axonal growth, neuroinflammation, protein folding, etc. The top 15 significantly enriched Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways included the oxytocin signaling pathway, long-term depression pathway, axon guidance, endometrial cancer, long-term potentiation, mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, and glutamatergic pathway, among others. In the patient group, significant associations of novel methylated genes with early trauma and psychopathology were observed.Our results suggest an association of differential DNA methylation with the pathophysiology of psychosis and early trauma.

"35931049","A multi-layer functional genomic analysis to understand noncoding genetic variation in lipids.","Am J Hum Genet","A major challenge of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) is to translate phenotypic associations into biological insights. Here, we integrate a large GWAS on blood lipids involving 1.6 million individuals from five ancestries with a wide array of functional genomic datasets to discover regulatory mechanisms underlying lipid associations. We first prioritize lipid-associated genes with expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) colocalizations and then add chromatin interaction data to narrow the search for functional genes. Polygenic enrichment analysis across 697 annotations from a host of tissues and cell types confirms the central role of the liver in lipid levels and highlights the selective enrichment of adipose-specific chromatin marks in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides. Overlapping transcription factor (TF) binding sites with lipid-associated loci identifies TFs relevant in lipid biology. In addition, we present an integrative framework to prioritize causal variants at GWAS loci, producing a comprehensive list of candidate causal genes and variants with multiple layers of functional evidence.

African ancestry is a significant risk factor, with mortality rates across sub-Saharan Africa of 2.7-fold higher than global averages1. The contributing genetic and non-genetic factors, and associated mutational processes, are unknown2,3. Here, through whole-genome sequencing of treatment-naive prostate cancer samples from 183 ancestrally (African versus European) and globally distinct patients, we generate a large cancer genomics resource for sub-Saharan Africa, identifying around 2 million somatic variants. Significant African-ancestry-specific findings include an elevated tumour mutational burden, increased percentage of genome alteration, a greater number of predicted damaging mutations and a higher total of mutational signatures, and the driver genes NCOA2, STK19, DDX11L1, PCAT1 and SETBP1. Examining all somatic mutational types, we describe a molecular taxonomy for prostate cancer differentiated by ancestry and defined as global mutational subtypes (GMS). By further including Chinese Asian data, we confirm that GMS-B (copy-number gain) and GMS-D (mutationally noisy) are specific to African populations, GMS-A (mutationally quiet) is universal (all ethnicities) and the African-European-restricted subtype GMS-C (copy-number losses) predicts poor clinical outcomes. In addition to the clinical benefit of including individuals of African ancestry, our GMS subtypes reveal different evolutionary trajectories and mutational processes suggesting that both common genetic and environmental factors contribute to the disparity between ethnicities. Analogous to gene-environment interaction-defined here as a different effect of an environmental surrounding in people with different ancestries or vice versa-we anticipate that GMS subtypes act as a proxy for intrinsic and extrinsic mutational processes in cancers, promoting global inclusion in landmark studies.© 2022.

"36042521","A genetic model for central chondrosarcoma evolution correlates with patient outcome.","Genome Med","Central conventional chondrosarcoma (CS) is the most common subtype of primary malignant bone tumour in adults. Treatment options are usually limited to surgery, and prognosis is challenging. These tumours are characterised by the presence and absence of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations, and recently, TERT promoter alterations have been reported in around 20% of cases. The effect of these mutations on clinical outcome remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to determine if prognostic accuracy can be improved by the addition of genomic data, and specifically by examination of IDH1, IDH2, and TERT mutations.In this study, we combined both archival samples and data sourced from the Genomics England 100,000 Genomes Project (n = 356). Mutations in IDH1, IDH2, and TERT were profiled using digital droplet PCR (n = 346), whole genome sequencing (n=68), or both (n = 64). Complex events and other genetic features were also examined, along with methylation array data (n = 84). We correlated clinical features and patient outcomes with our genetic findings.IDH2-mutant tumours occur in older patients and commonly present with high-grade or dedifferentiated disease. Notably, TERT mutations occur most frequently in IDH2-mutant tumours, although have no effect on survival in this group. In contrast, TERT mutations are rarer in IDH1-mutant tumours, yet they are associated with a less favourable outcome in this group. We also found that methylation profiles distinguish IDH1- from IDH2-mutant tumours. IDH wild-type tumours rarely exhibit TERT mutations and tend to be diagnosed in a younger population than those with tumours harbouring IDH1 and IDH2 mutations. A major genetic feature of this group is haploidisation and subsequent genome doubling. These tumours evolve less frequently to dedifferentiated disease and therefore constitute a lower risk group.Tumours with IDH1 or IDH2 mutations or those that are IDHwt have significantly different genetic pathways and outcomes in relation to TERT mutation. Diagnostic testing for IDH1, IDH2, and TERT mutations could therefore help to guide clinical monitoring and prognostication.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35999207","Genome-wide mutational signatures in low-coverage whole genome sequencing of cell-free DNA.","Nat Commun","Mutational signatures accumulate in somatic cells as an admixture of endogenous and exogenous processes that occur during an individual's lifetime. Since dividing cells release cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragments into the circulation, we hypothesize that plasma cfDNA might reflect mutational signatures. Point mutations in plasma whole genome sequencing (WGS) are challenging to identify through conventional mutation calling due to low sequencing coverage and low mutant allele fractions. In this proof of concept study of plasma WGS at 0.3-1.5x coverage from 215 patients and 227 healthy individuals, we show that both pathological and physiological mutational signatures may be identified in plasma. By applying machine learning to mutation profiles, patients with stage I-IV cancer can be distinguished from healthy individuals with an Area Under the Curve of 0.96. Interrogating mutational processes in plasma may enable earlier cancer detection, and might enable the assessment of cancer risk and etiology.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35996174","Evolution of intra-tumoral heterogeneity across different pathological stages in papillary thyroid carcinoma.","Cancer Cell Int","Intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH) results from the continuous accumulation of mutations during disease progression, thus impacting patients' clinical outcome. How the ITH evolves across papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) different tumor stages is lacking.We used the whole-exome sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas Thyroid Cancer (TCGA-THCA) cohort to track the ITH and assessed its relationship with clinical features through different stages of the PTC progression. We further assayed the expression levels of the specific genes in papillary thyroid cancer cell lines compared to an immortalized normal thyroid epithelial cell line by qRT-PCR.We revealed the timing of mutational processes and the dynamics of the temporal acquisition of somatic events during the lifetime of the PTC. ITH significantly influences the PTC patient's survival rate and, as genetic heterogeneity increases, the prognosis gets worse in advanced tumor stages. ITH also affects the mutational architecture of each clinical stage which is subject to periodic fluctuations. Different mutational processes may cooperate to shape a stage-specific mutational spectrum during the progression from early to advanced tumor stages. Moreover, different evolutionary paths characterize PTC progression across pathological stages due to both mutations recurrently occurring in all stages in hotspot positions and distinct codon changes dominating in different stages. A different expression level of specific genes also exists in different thyroid cancer cell lines.Our findings suggest ITH as a potential unfavorable prognostic factor in PTC and highlight the dynamic changes in different clinical stages of PTC, providing some clues for the precision medicine and suggesting different diagnostic decisions depending on the clinical stages of patients. Finally, complete clear guidelines to define risk stratification of PTC patients are lacking; thus, this work could contribute to defining patients who need more aggressive treatments and, in turn, could reduce the social burden of this cancer.© 2022.

Varied responses to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors have recently been observed in NSCLC patients harboring different types of EGFR mutations. Some EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients may benefit from PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. At present, PD-L1 expression, tumor mutational burden (TMB), and tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) are biomarkers for predicting the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in NSCLC patients. We retrospectively evaluated PD-L1 expression, TMB, and immune cell infiltration in NSCLC patients with EGFR mutation subtypes.PD-L1 expression, TMB, and the abundance of immune cell infiltration in NSCLC patients were evaluated in public databases and clinical samples. TMB was detected using the NGS technique, PD-L1 was detected using immunohistochemistry, and the abundance of immune cell infiltration in NSCLC samples was detected using multiple immunohistochemistry.PD-L1 expression and TMB were lower in EGFR-mutated NSCLCs than in wild-type patients. Differences in the abundance of immune cell infiltration were also observed between EGFR-mutated and wild-type NSCLC. The expression of PD-L1, TMB, and abundance of immune cell infiltration were different in patients harboring different subtypes of EGFR mutations. Patients with uncommon EGFR mutations, especially the G719X mutation, showed higher TMB and expressions of PD-L1 than classical EGFR mutations. M1 macrophages were higher in uncommon EGFR mutations than classical EGFR mutations.The expression of PD-L1 and TMB in uncommon EGFR-mutated NSCLCs, especially the G719X mutation, were higher than those for classical EGFR-mutated NSCLCs and similar to EGFR wild-type. The abundance of immune cell infiltration in uncommon EGFR-mutated NSCLCs was similar to that in EGFR wild-type. Our findings suggest that uncommon EGFR-mutated NSCLCs may benefit from PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors.Copyright © 2022 Ma, Jiao, Huo, Li, Fang, Zhao, Liu, Han, Xi, Wang and Shang."
"35947558","Chromatin accessibility of primary human cancers ties regional mutational processes and signatures with tissues of origin.","PLoS Comput Biol","Somatic mutations in cancer genomes are associated with DNA replication timing (RT) and chromatin accessibility (CA), however these observations are based on normal tissues and cell lines while primary cancer epigenomes remain uncharacterised. Here we use machine learning to model megabase-scale mutation burden in 2,500 whole cancer genomes and 17 cancer types via a compendium of 900 CA and RT profiles covering primary cancers, normal tissues, and cell lines. CA profiles of primary cancers, rather than those of normal tissues, are most predictive of regional mutagenesis in most cancer types. Feature prioritisation shows that the epigenomes of matching cancer types and organ systems are often the strongest predictors of regional mutation burden, highlighting disease-specific associations of mutational processes. The genomic distributions of mutational signatures are also shaped by the epigenomes of matched cancer and tissue types, with SBS5/40, carcinogenic and unknown signatures most accurately predicted by our models. In contrast, fewer associations of RT and regional mutagenesis are found. Lastly, the models highlight genomic regions with overrepresented mutations that dramatically exceed epigenome-derived expectations and show a pan-cancer convergence to genes and pathways involved in development and oncogenesis, indicating the potential of this approach for coding and non-coding driver discovery. The association of regional mutational processes with the epigenomes of primary cancers suggests that the landscape of passenger mutations is predominantly shaped by the epigenomes of cancer cells after oncogenic transformation."

The mutations we found were confirmed by subcloning and Sanger sequencing of the genomic DNA. RNA-seq was performed to profile gene expression in paired BCCs samples and the expression levels for selected genes were validated by quantitative PCR.The clinical and histopathologic features were analyzed for the proband in the three-generation GS family. We identified the insertion mutation PTCH1 c.1341dupA (p. L448Tfs*49), which segregated with BCC phenotype and contributed to the death of two in four patients from a Chinese family with GS. Compared with adjacent non-cancerous tissues (ANCT), four second-hit mutations were found in four of the six pairs of BCC from three patients. Of note, somatic genomic alterations in all six BCC samples were mainly clustered into non-clock-like Signature 7 (ultraviolet mutagenesis) and 11 (related to certain alkylating agents). Both RNA-seq and quantitative RT-PCR confirmed that the mRNA levels of PTCH1 and its effector GLI1 were markedly upregulated in six pairs of BCC samples versus ANCT.The distinct non-clock-like signatures of BCCs indicated that GS was not a life-threatening illness.

However, it is unclear how exposure to chemotherapy contributes to the mutation burden and clonal composition of healthy tissues early in life. Here, we studied mutation accumulation in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) before and after cancer treatment of 24 children. Of these children, 19 developed therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MN). Posttreatment HSPCs had an average mutation burden increase comparable to what treatment-naïve cells accumulate during 16 years of life, with excesses up to 80 years. In most children, these additional mutations were induced by clock-like processes, which are also active during healthy aging. Other patients harbored mutations that could be directly attributed to treatments like platinum-based drugs and thiopurines. Using phylogenetic inference, we demonstrate that most t-MN in children originate after the start of treatment and that leukemic clones become dominant during or directly after chemotherapy exposure.Our study shows that chemotherapy increases the mutation burden of normal blood cells in cancer survivors. Only few drugs damage the DNA directly, whereas in most patients, chemotherapy-induced mutations are caused by processes similar to those present during normal aging.

"35948928","Identification of influential probe types in epigenetic predictions of human traits: implications for microarray design.","Clin Epigenetics","CpG methylation levels can help to explain inter-individual differences in phenotypic traits. Few studies have explored whether identifying probe subsets based on their biological and statistical properties can maximise predictions whilst minimising array content. Variance component analyses and penalised regression (epigenetic predictors) were used to test the influence of (i) the number of probes considered, (ii) mean probe variability and (iii) methylation QTL status on the variance captured in eighteen traits by blood DNA methylation. Training and test samples comprised ≤ 4450 and ≤ 2578 unrelated individuals from Generation Scotland, respectively.As the number of probes under consideration decreased, so too did the estimates from variance components and prediction analyses. Methylation QTL status and mean probe variability did not influence variance components. However, relative effect sizes were 15% larger for epigenetic predictors based on probes with known or reported methylation QTLs compared to probes without reported methylation QTLs. Relative effect sizes were 45% larger for predictors based on probes with mean Beta-values between 10 and 90% compared to those based on hypo- or hypermethylated probes (Beta-value ≤ 10% or ≥ 90%).Arrays with fewer probes could reduce costs, leading to increased sample sizes for analyses. Our results show that reducing array content can restrict prediction metrics and careful attention must be given to the biological and distribution properties of CpG probes in array content selection.© 2022.

"36042399","A comprehensive comparison of multilocus association methods with summary statistics in genome-wide association studies.","BMC Bioinformatics","Multilocus analysis on a set of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) pre-assigned within a gene constitutes a valuable complement to single-marker analysis by aggregating data on complex traits in a biologically meaningful way. However, despite the existence of a wide variety of SNP-set methods, few comprehensive comparison studies have been previously performed to evaluate the effectiveness of these methods.We herein sought to fill this knowledge gap by conducting a comprehensive empirical comparison for 22 commonly-used summary-statistics based SNP-set methods. We showed that only seven methods could effectively control the type I error, and that these well-calibrated approaches had varying power performance under the simulation scenarios. Overall, we confirmed that the burden test was generally underpowered and score-based variance component tests (e.g., sequence kernel association test) were much powerful under the polygenic genetic architecture in both common and rare variant association analyses. We further revealed that two linkage-disequilibrium-free P value combination methods (e.g., harmonic mean P value method and aggregated Cauchy association test) behaved very well under the sparse genetic architecture in simulations and real-data applications to common and rare variant association analyses as well as in expression quantitative trait loci weighted integrative analysis. We also assessed the scalability of these approaches by recording computational time and found that all these methods can be scalable to biobank-scale data although some might be relatively slow.In conclusion, we hope that our findings can offer an important guidance on how to choose appropriate multilocus association analysis methods in post-GWAS era.

Here, we performed the largest genome-wide association meta-analysis of HIV-1 acquisition, which included 7,303 HIV-1-positive individuals and 587,343 population controls. We identified 25 independent genetic loci with suggestive association, of which one was genome-wide significant within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) locus. After exclusion of the MHC signal, linkage disequilibrium score regression analyses revealed a SNP heritability of 21% and genetic correlations with behavioral factors. A transcriptome-wide association study identified 15 susceptibility genes, includingHERC1,UEVLD, andHIST1H4K. Convergent evidence from conditional analyses and fine-mapping identifiedHERC1downregulation in immune cells as a robust mechanism associated with HIV-1 acquisition. Functional studies onHERC1and other identified candidates, as well as larger genetic studies, have the potential to further our understanding of the host mechanisms associated with protection against HIV-1.© 2022 The Author(s)."
"36008388","Chromatin conformation of human oral epithelium can identify orofacial cleft missing functional variants.","Int J Oral Sci","Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are the most widely used method to identify genetic risk loci associated with orofacial clefts (OFC). However, despite the increasing size of cohort, GWASs are still insufficient to detect all the heritability, suggesting there are more associations under the current stringent statistical threshold. In this study, we obtained an integrated epigenomic dataset based on the chromatin conformation of a human oral epithelial cell line (HIOEC) using RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, and DLO Hi-C. Presumably, this epigenomic dataset could reveal the missing functional variants located in the oral epithelial cell active enhancers/promoters along with their risk target genes, despite relatively less-stringent statistical association with OFC. Taken a non-syndromic cleft palate only (NSCPO) GWAS data of the Chinese Han population as an example, 3664 SNPs that cannot reach the strict significance threshold were subjected to this functional identification pipeline. In total, 254 potential risk SNPs residing in active cis-regulatory elements interacting with 1 718 promoters of oral epithelium-expressed genes were screened. Gapped k-mer machine learning based on enhancers interacting with epithelium-expressed genes along with in vivo and in vitro reporter assays were employed as functional validation. Among all the potential SNPs, we chose and confirmed that the risk alleles of rs560789 and rs174570 reduced the epithelial-specific enhancer activity by preventing the binding of transcription factors related to epithelial development. In summary, we established chromatin conformation datasets of human oral epithelial cells and provided a framework for testing and understanding how regulatory variants impart risk for clefts.© 2022.

"35994476","A genome-wide association study of total child psychiatric problems scores.","PLoS One","Substantial genetic correlations have been reported across psychiatric disorders and numerous cross-disorder genetic variants have been detected. To identify the genetic variants underlying general psychopathology in childhood, we performed a genome-wide association study using a total psychiatric problem score. We analyzed 6,844,199 common SNPs in 38,418 school-aged children from 20 population-based cohorts participating in the EAGLE consortium. The SNP heritability of total psychiatric problems was 5.4% (SE = 0.01) and two loci reached genome-wide significance: rs10767094 and rs202005905. We also observed an association of SBF2, a gene associated with neuroticism in previous GWAS, with total psychiatric problems. The genetic effects underlying the total score were shared with common psychiatric disorders only (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, depression, insomnia) (rG > 0.49), but not with autism or the less common adult disorders (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or eating disorders) (rG < 0.01). Importantly, the total psychiatric problem score also showed at least a moderate genetic correlation with intelligence, educational attainment, wellbeing, smoking, and body fat (rG > 0.29). The results suggest that many common genetic variants are associated with childhood psychiatric symptoms and related phenotypes in general instead of with specific symptoms. Further research is needed to establish causality and pleiotropic mechanisms between related traits."

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of JIA have identified hundreds of risk factors, but few of them implicated specific biological mechanisms.A cross-tissue transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) was performed with the functional summary-based imputation software (FUSION) tool based on GWAS summary datasets (898 JIA patients and 346,102 controls from BioBank Japan (BBJ)/FinnGen). The gene expression reference weights of skeletal muscle and the whole blood were obtained from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTExv8) project. JIA-related genes identified by TWAS findings genes were further compared with the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified by the mRNA expression profile of JIA from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (accession number: GSE1402). Last, candidate genes were analyzed using functional enrichment and annotation analysis by Metascape to examine JIA-related gene sets.The TWAS identified 535 significant genes withP< 0.05 and contains 350 for Asian and 195 for European (including 10 genes both expressed in Asian and European), such asCDC16(P= 1.72E-03) andPSMD5-AS1(P= 3.65E-02). Eight overlapping genes were identified based on TWAS results and DEGs of JIA patients, such asSIRPB1(PTWAS= 4.21E-03,PDEG= 1.50E-04) andFRAT2(PTWAS= 2.82E-02,PDEG= 1.43E-02). Pathway enrichment analysis of TWAS identified 183 pathways such as cytokine signaling in the immune system and cell adhesion molecules. By integrating the results of DEGs pathway and process enrichment analyses, 19 terms were identified such as positive regulation of T-cell activation.By conducting two populations TWAS, we identified a group of JIA-associated genes and pathways, which may provide novel clues to uncover the pathogenesis of JIA.Copyright © 2022 Xu, Ma, Zeng, Si, Wu, Zhang and Shen."
"35962193","Trans-genetic effects of circular RNA expression quantitative trait loci and potential causal mechanisms in autism.","Mol Psychiatry","Genetic risk variants and transcriptional expression changes in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) were widely investigated, but their causal relationship remains largely unknown. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are abundant in brain and often serve as upstream regulators of mRNAs. By integrating RNA-sequencing with genotype data from autistic brains, we assessed expression quantitative trait loci of circRNAs (circQTLs) that cis-regulated expression of nearby circRNAs and trans-regulated expression of distant genes (trans-eGenes) simultaneously. We thus identified 3619 circQTLs that were also trans-eQTLs and constructed 19,804 circQTL-circRNA-trans-eGene regulatory axes. We conducted two different types of approaches, mediation and partial correlation tests (MPT), to determine the axes with mediation effects of circQTLs on trans-eGene expression through circRNA expression. We showed that the mediation effects of the circQTLs (trans-eQTLs) on circRNA expression were positively correlated with the magnitude of circRNA-trans-eGene correlation of expression profile. The positive correlation became more significant after adjustment for the circQTLs. Of the 19,804 axes, 8103 passed MPT. Meanwhile, we performed causal inference test (CIT) and identified 2070 circQTL-trans-eGene-ASD diagnosis propagation paths. We showed that the CIT-passing genes were significantly enriched for ASD risk genes, genes encoding postsynaptic density proteins, and other ASD-relevant genes, supporting the relevance of the CIT-passing genes to ASD pathophysiology. Integration of MPT- and CIT-passing axes further constructed 352 circQTL-circRNA-trans-eGene-ASD diagnosis propagation paths, wherein the circRNA-trans-eGene axes may act as causal mediators for the circQTL-ASD diagnosis associations. These analyses were also successfully applied to an independent dataset from schizophrenia brains. Collectively, this study provided the first framework for systematically investigating trans-genetic effects of circQTLs and inferring the corresponding causal relations in diseases. The identified circQTL-circRNA-trans-eGene regulatory interactions, particularly the internal modules that were previously implicated in the examined disorders, also provided a helpful dataset for further investigating causative biology and cryptic regulatory mechanisms underlying the neuropsychiatric diseases.© 2022.

"35953856","Limited evidence for blood eQTLs in human sexual dimorphism.","Genome Med","The genetic underpinning of sexual dimorphism is very poorly understood. The prevalence of many diseases differs between men and women, which could be in part caused by sex-specific genetic effects. Nevertheless, only a few published genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were performed separately in each sex. The reported enrichment of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) among GWAS-associated SNPs suggests a potential role of sex-specific eQTLs in the sex-specific genetic mechanism underlying complex traits.To explore this scenario, we combined sex-specific whole blood RNA-seq eQTL data from 3447 European individuals included in BIOS Consortium and GWAS data from UK Biobank. Next, to test the presence of sex-biased causal effect of gene expression on complex traits, we performed sex-specific transcriptome-wide Mendelian randomization (TWMR) analyses on the two most sexually dimorphic traits, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and testosterone levels. Finally, we performed power analysis to calculate the GWAS sample size needed to observe sex-specific trait associations driven by sex-biased eQTLs.Among 9 million SNP-gene pairs showing sex-combined associations, we found 18 genes with significant sex-biased cis-eQTLs (FDR 5%). Our phenome-wide association study of the 18 top sex-biased eQTLs on >700 traits unraveled that these eQTLs do not systematically translate into detectable sex-biased trait-associations. In addition, we observed that sex-specific causal effects of gene expression on complex traits are not driven by sex-specific eQTLs. Power analyses using real eQTL- and causal-effect sizes showed that millions of samples would be necessary to observe sex-biased trait associations that are fully driven by sex-biased cis-eQTLs. Compensatory effects may further hamper their detection.Our results suggest that sex-specific eQTLs in whole blood do not translate to detectable sex-specific trait associations of complex diseases, and vice versa that the observed sex-specific trait associations cannot be explained by sex-specific eQTLs.© 2022.

"35947372","Association Between Brain Structure and Alcohol Use Behaviors in Adults: A Mendelian Randomization and Multiomics Study.","JAMA Psychiatry","Past studies have identified associations between brain macrostructure and alcohol use behaviors. However, identifying directional associations between these phenotypes is difficult due to the limitations of observational studies.To use mendelian randomization (MR) to identify directional associations between brain structure and alcohol use and elucidate the transcriptomic and cellular underpinnings of identified associations.The main source data comprised summary statistics from population-based and case-control genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of neuroimaging, behavioral, and clinical phenotypes (N = 763 874). Using these data, bidirectional and multivariable MR was performed analyzing associations between brain macrostructure and alcohol use. Downstream transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) and cell-type enrichment analyses investigated the biology underlying identified associations. The study approach was data driven and did not test any a priori hypotheses. Data were analyzed August 2021 to May 2022.Brain structure phenotypes (global cortical thickness [GCT] and global cortical surface area [GCSA] in 33 709 individuals and left-right subcortical volumes in 19 629 individuals) and alcohol use behaviors (alcoholic drinks per week [DPW] in 537 349 individuals, binge drinking frequency in 143 685 individuals, and alcohol use disorder in 8845 individuals vs 20 657 control individuals [total of 29 502]).The main bidirectional MR analyses were performed in samples totaling 763 874 individuals, among whom more than 94% were of European ancestry, 52% to 54% were female, and the mean cohort ages were 40 to 63 years. Negative associations were identified between genetically predicted GCT and binge drinking (β, -2.52; 95% CI, -4.13 to -0.91) and DPW (β, -0.88; 95% CI, -1.37 to -0.40) at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05. These associations remained significant in multivariable MR models that accounted for neuropsychiatric phenotypes, substance use, trauma, and neurodegeneration. TWAS of GCT and alcohol use behaviors identified 5 genes at the 17q21.31 locus oppositely associated with GCT and binge drinking or DPW (FDR = 0.05). Cell-type enrichment analyses implicated glutamatergic cortical neurons in alcohol use behaviors.The findings in this study show that the associations between GCT and alcohol use may reflect a predispositional influence of GCT and that 17q21.31 genes and glutamatergic cortical neurons may play a role in this association. While replication studies are needed, these findings should enhance the understanding of associations between brain structure and alcohol use."

"36011341","An Integrative Genomic Prediction Approach for Predicting Buffalo Milk Traits by Incorporating Related Cattle QTLs.","Genes (Basel)","The 90K Axiom Buffalo SNP Array is expected to improve and speed up various genomic analyses for the buffalo (Bubalus bubalis). Genomic prediction is an effective approach in animal breeding to improve selection and reduce costs. As buffalo genome research is lagging behind that of the cow and production records are also limited, genomic prediction performance will be relatively poor. To improve the genomic prediction in buffalo, we introduced a new approach (pGBLUP) for genomic prediction of six buffalo milk traits by incorporating QTL information from the cattle milk traits in order to help improve the prediction performance for buffalo.In simulations, the pGBLUP could outperform BayesR and the GBLUP if the prior biological information (i.e., the known causal loci) was appropriate; otherwise, it performed slightly worse than BayesR and equal to or better than the GBLUP. In real data, the heritability of the buffalo genomic region corresponding to the cattle milk trait QTLs was enriched (fold of enrichment &gt; 1) in four buffalo milk traits (FY270, MY270, PY270, and PM) when the EBV was used as the response variable. The DEBV as the response variable yielded more reliable genomic predictions than the traditional EBV, as has been shown by previous research. The performance of the three approaches (GBLUP, BayesR, and pGBLUP) did not vary greatly in this study, probably due to the limited sample size, incomplete prior biological information, and less artificial selection in buffalo.To our knowledge, this study is the first to apply genomic prediction to buffalo by incorporating prior biological information. The genomic prediction of buffalo traits can be further improved with a larger sample size, higher-density SNP chips, and more precise prior biological information."

Focusing on 17,315 orthologous genes, we demonstrate that mean/median gene expression, inter-individual variation of expression, expression quantitative trait loci, and gene co-expression networks are generally conserved between humans and cattle. By examining large-scale genome-wide association studies for 46 human traits (average n = 327,973) and 45 cattle traits (average n = 24,635), we reveal that the heritability of complex traits in both species is significantly more enriched in transcriptionally conserved than diverged genes across tissues.In summary, our study provides a comprehensive comparison of transcriptomes between humans and cattle, which might help decipher the genetic and evolutionary basis of complex traits in both species.© 2022.

Morphology related to these factors is present by birth, yet the developmental-genetic mechanisms governing pelvic shape remain largely unknown. Here, we pinpoint and characterize a key gestational window when human-specific pelvic morphology becomes recognizable, as the ilium and the entire pelvis acquire traits essential for human walking and birth. We next use functional genomics to molecularly characterize chondrocytes from different pelvic subelements during this window to reveal their developmental-genetic architectures. We then find notable evidence of ancient selection and genetic constraint on regulatory sequences involved in ilium expansion and growth, findings complemented by our phenotypic analyses showing that variation in iliac traits is reduced in humans compared to African apes. Our datasets provide important resources for musculoskeletal biology and begin to elucidate developmental mechanisms that shape human-specific morphology."

Although most back pain cases are acute, 20% of acute pain patients experience chronic back pain symptoms. It is unclear whether acute pain and chronic pain have similar or distinct underlying genetic mechanisms.To characterize the molecular and cellular pathways contributing to acute and chronic pain states.Cross-sectional observational genome-wide association study.A total of 375,158 individuals from the UK Biobank cohort were included in the discovery of genome-wide association study. Of those, 70,633 (19%) and 32,209 (9%) individuals met the definition of chronic and acute back pain, respectively. A total of 355 single nucleotide polymorphism grouped into 13 loci reached the genome-wide significance threshold (5x10-8) for chronic back pain, but none for acute. Of these, 7 loci were replicated in the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT) cohort (19,760 chronic low back pain cases and 28,674 pain-free controls). Single nucleotide polymorphism heritability was 4.6% (P=1.4x10-78) for chronic back pain and 0.81% (P=1.4x10-8) for acute back pain. Similar differences in heritability estimates between acute and chronic back pain were found in the HUNT cohort: 3.4% (P=0.0011) and 0.6% (P=0.851), respectively. Pathway analyses, tissue-specific heritability enrichment analyses, and epigenetic characterization suggest a substantial genetic contribution to chronic but not acute back pain from the loci predominantly expressed in the central nervous system.Chronic back pain is substantially more heritable than acute back pain. This heritability is mostly attributed to genes expressed in the brain.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

In addition, candidate genes associated with these risk SNPs were investigated based on genomic proximity instead of their functional cellular contexts. Here, we compiled regulatory networks of 77 human contexts and revealed those risk SNPs' enriched cellular contexts and associated risk SNPs with transcription factors, regulatory elements, and target genes. Twenty-one human contexts were identified and grouped into two categories: immune cells and epithelium cells. We further aggregated the regulatory networks of immune cells and epithelium cells. These two aggregated regulatory networks were investigated to reveal their association with risk SNPs' regulation. Two genomic clusters, the chemokine receptors cluster and the oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) cluster, showed the strongest association with COVID-19 severity, and they had different regulatory programs in immune and epithelium contexts.

"36042491","Genetic evidence for a causal relationship between type 2 diabetes and peripheral artery disease in both Europeans and East Asians.","BMC Med","Observational studies have revealed that type 2 diabetes (T2D) is associated with an increased risk of peripheral artery disease (PAD). However, whether the two diseases share a genetic basis and whether the relationship is causal remain unclear. It is also unclear as to whether these relationships differ between ethnic groups.By leveraging large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics of T2D (European-based: Ncase= 21,926, Ncontrol= 342,747; East Asian-based: Ncase= 36,614, Ncontrol= 155,150) and PAD (European-based: Ncase= 5673, Ncontrol= 359,551; East Asian-based: Ncase= 3593, Ncontrol= 208,860), we explored the genetic correlation and putative causal relationship between T2D and PAD in both Europeans and East Asians using linkage disequilibrium score regression and seven Mendelian randomization (MR) models. We also performed multi-trait analysis of GWAS and two gene-based analyses to reveal candidate variants and risk genes involved in the shared genetic basis between T2D and PAD.We observed a strong genetic correlation (rg) between T2D and PAD in both Europeans (rg= 0.51; p-value = 9.34 × 10-15) and East Asians (rg= 0.46; p-value = 1.67 × 10-12). The MR analyses provided consistent evidence for a causal effect of T2D on PAD in both ethnicities (odds ratio [OR] = 1.05 to 1.28 for Europeans and 1.15 to 1.27 for East Asians) but not PAD on T2D. This putative causal effect was not influenced by total cholesterol, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, or smoking initiation according to multivariable MR analysis, and the genetic overlap between T2D and PAD was further explored employing an independent European sample through polygenic risk score regression. Multi-trait analysis of GWAS revealed two novel European-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs927742 and rs1734409) associated with the shared genetic basis of T2D and PAD. Gene-based analyses consistently identified one gene ANKFY1 and gene-gene interactions (e.g., STARD10 [European-specific] to AP3S2 [East Asian-specific]; KCNJ11 [European-specific] to KCNQ1 [East Asian-specific]) associated with the trans-ethnic genetic overlap between T2D and PAD, reflecting a common genetic basis for the co-occurrence of T2D and PAD in both Europeans and East Asians.Our study provides the first evidence for a genetically causal effect of T2D on PAD in both Europeans and East Asians. Several candidate variants and risk genes were identified as being associated with this genetic overlap. Our findings emphasize the importance of monitoring PAD status in T2D patients and suggest new genetic biomarkers for screening PAD risk among patients with T2D.© 2022. The Author(s)."

"36009718","Genome-Wide Associative Study of Phenotypic Parameters of the 3D Body Model of Aberdeen Angus Cattle with Multiple Depth Cameras.","Animals (Basel)","In beef cattle breeding, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) arrays can reveal many loci of various production traits, such as growth, productivity, and meat quality. With the development of genome sequencing technologies, new opportunities are opening up for more accurate identification of areas associated with these traits. This article aims to develop a novel approach to the lifetime evaluation of cattle by 3-D visualization of economic-biological and genetic features. The purpose of this study was to identify significant variants underlying differences in the qualitative characteristics of meat, using imputed data on the sequence of the entire genome. Samples of biomaterial of young Aberdeen-Angus breed cattle (n = 96) were the material for carrying out genome-wide SNP genotyping. Genotyping was performed using a high-density DNA chip Bovine GPU HD BeadChip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), containing ~150 thousand SNPs. The following indicators were selected as phenotypic features: chest width and chest girth retrieved by 3-D model and meat output on the bones. Correlation analysis showed a reliable positive relationship between chest width and meat output on the bones, which can potentially be used for lifetime evaluation of meat productivity of animals."

We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis for each psychiatric disorder (substance misuse, depression, anxiety, psychotic disorder, and stress-related disorders) in a randomly selected half of the study population (""base dataset""). For the other half (""target dataset""), the polygenic risk score (PRS) was calculated as a proxy of individuals' genetic predisposition to a given psychiatric phenotype using discovered genetic variants from the base dataset. Ascertainment of COVID-19 was based on the Public Health England dataset, inpatient hospital data, or death registers in UK Biobank. COVID-19 cases from hospitalization records or death records were considered ""severe cases."" The association between the PRS for psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 risk was examined using logistic regression. We also repeated PRS analyses based on publicly available GWAS summary statistics.A total of 143,562 participants (including 10,868 COVID-19 cases) were used for PRS analyses. A higher genetic predisposition to psychiatric disorders was associated with an increased risk of any COVID-19 and severe COVID-19. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for any COVID-19 was 1.07 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.13) and 1.06 (95% CI 1.01-1.11) among individuals with a high genetic risk (above the upper tertile of the PRS) for substance misuse and depression, respectively, compared with individuals with a low genetic risk (below the lower tertile). Slightly higher ORs were noted for severe COVID-19, and similar result patterns were obtained in analyses based on publicly available GWAS summary statistics.Our findings suggest a potential role of genetic factors in the observed phenotypic association between psychiatric disorders and COVID-19. Our data underscore the need for increased medical surveillance for this vulnerable population during the COVID-19 pandemic.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35999215","Estimating effects of parents' cognitive and non-cognitive skills on offspring education using polygenic scores.","Nat Commun","Understanding how parents' cognitive and non-cognitive skills influence offspring education is essential for educational, family and economic policy. We use genetics (GWAS-by-subtraction) to assess a latent, broad non-cognitive skills dimension. To index parental effects controlling for genetic transmission, we estimate indirect parental genetic effects of polygenic scores on childhood and adulthood educational outcomes, using siblings (N = 47,459), adoptees (N = 6407), and parent-offspring trios (N = 2534) in three UK and Dutch cohorts. We find that parental cognitive and non-cognitive skills affect offspring education through their environment: on average across cohorts and designs, indirect genetic effects explain 36-40% of population polygenic score associations. However, indirect genetic effects are lower for achievement in the Dutch cohort, and for the adoption design. We identify potential causes of higher sibling- and trio-based estimates: prenatal indirect genetic effects, population stratification, and assortative mating. Our phenotype-agnostic, genetically sensitive approach has established overall environmental effects of parents' skills, facilitating future mechanistic work.© 2022. The Author(s)."

The two-way relationship between periodontitis and hyperglycemia needs to be further elucidated. This study aims to evaluate the causal association of periodontitis with glycemic traits using bi-directional Mendelian randomization (MR) approach.Summary statistics were sourced from large-scale genome-wide association study conducted for fasting glucose (N = 133,010), HbA1c (N = 123,665), type 2 diabetes (T2D, N = 659,316), and periodontitis (N = 506,594) among European ancestry. The causal relationship was estimated using the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) model and further validated through extensive complementary and sensitivity analyses.Overall, IVW showed that a genetically higher level of fasting glucose was significantly associated with periodontitis (OR = 1.119; 95% CI = 1.045-1.197;PFDR= 0.007) after removing the outlying instruments. Such association was robust and consistent through other MR models. Limited evidence was found suggesting the association of HbA1C with periodontitis after excluding the outliers (IVW OR = 1.123; 95% CI = 1.026-1.229;PFDR= 0.048). These linkages remained statistically significant in multivariate MR analyses, after adjusting for body mass index. The reverse direction MR analyses did not exhibit the causal association of genetic liability to periodontitis with any of the glycemic trait tested.Our MR study reaffirms previous findings and extends evidence to substantiate the causal effect of hyperglycemia on periodontitis.

"35974034","Brain aging differs with cognitive ability regardless of education.","Sci Rep","Higher general cognitive ability (GCA) is associated with lower risk of neurodegenerative disorders, but neural mechanisms are unknown. GCA could be associated with more cortical tissue, from young age, i.e. brain reserve, or less cortical atrophy in adulthood, i.e. brain maintenance. Controlling for education, we investigated the relative association of GCA with reserve and maintenance of cortical volume, -area and -thickness through the adult lifespan, using multiple longitudinal cognitively healthy brain imaging cohorts (n = 3327, 7002 MRI scans, baseline age 20-88 years, followed-up for up to 11 years). There were widespread positive relationships between GCA and cortical characteristics (level-level associations). In select regions, higher baseline GCA was associated with less atrophy over time (level-change associations). Relationships remained when controlling for polygenic scores for both GCA and education. Our findings suggest that higher GCA is associated with cortical volumes by both brain reserve and -maintenance mechanisms through the adult lifespan.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35974006","Maternal pregnancy-related infections and autism spectrum disorder-the genetic perspective.","Transl Psychiatry","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) refers to a group of neurodevelopmental disorders which include deficits in behavior, social interaction and communication. ASD has a complex genetic architecture, and it is also influenced by certain environmental exposures. Both types of predisposing factors may be related to immunological mechanisms, involving, for example, immune system genes and infections. Past studies have shown an association between infections occurring during the pregnancy in the mother and increased risk of ASD in the child, an observation which has received recent support from experimental animal studies of ASD-like behavior. The aim of this study was to study the genetic contribution to this effect. We employed genetic correlation analyses across potential ASD subtypes stratified on the basis of maternal pregnancy-related infections within the iPSYCH ASD case-cohort sample, as well as a case-case GWAS. We validated the trends of the genetic correlation analyses observed in our sample using GWAS summary statistics from the PGC ASD study (excluding iPSYCH). The genetic correlation between ASD with a history of maternal pregnancy-related infections and ASD without a history of maternal infections in iPSYCH was rg = 0.3811. We obtained a similar estimate between the former and the PGC ASD phenotype (rg = 0.3997). Both estimates are lower compared to the genetic correlation between ASD without a history of maternal infections and the PGC ASD phenotype (rg = 0.6735), and between ASD with a history of maternal infections occurring only more than 2 months following childbirth and the PGC ASD phenotype (rg = 0.6293). Additionally, we observed genetic variance between the two main ASD phenotypes using summary statistics from the case-case GWAS in iPSYCH (h2cc = 0.1059), indicating genome-wide differences between the phenotypes. Our results suggest potentially different etiologies of ASD based on a history of maternal pregnancy-related infections, which may, in part, be genetic. This highlights the relevance of maternal pregnancy-related infections to genetic studies of ASD and provides new insights into the molecular underpinnings of ASD.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35970022","Substance use and common contributors to morbidity: A genetics perspective.","EBioMedicine","Excessive substance use and substance use disorders (SUDs) are common, serious and relapsing medical conditions. They frequently co-occur with other diseases that are leading contributors to disability worldwide. While heavy substance use may potentiate the course of some of these illnesses, there is accumulating evidence suggesting common genetic architectures. In this narrative review, we focus on four heritable medical conditions - cardiometabolic disease, chronic pain, depression and COVID-19, which are commonly overlapping with, but not necessarily a direct consequence of, SUDs. We find persuasive evidence of underlying genetic liability that predisposes to both SUDs and chronic pain, depression, and COVID-19. For cardiometabolic disease, there is greater support for a potential causal influence of problematic substance use. Our review encourages de-stigmatization of SUDs and the assessment of substance use in clinical settings. We assert that identifying shared pathways of risk has high translational potential, allowing tailoring of treatments for multiple medical conditions.

However, the stability of aggregate genetic variation influencing BMI from midlife and beyond is unknown. By analysing 165,717 men and 193,073 women from the UKBiobank, we performed BMI GWAS on six independent five-year age intervals between 40 and 72 years. We then applied genomic structural equation modeling to test competing hypotheses regarding the stability of genetic effects for BMI. LDSR genetic correlations between BMI assessed between ages 40 to 73 were all very high and ranged 0.89 to 1.00. Genomic structural equation modeling revealed that molecular genetic variance in BMI at each age interval could not be explained by the accumulation of any age-specific genetic influences or autoregressive processes. Instead, a common set of stable genetic influences appears to underpin genome-wide variation in BMI from middle to early old age in men and women alike."

Whether this association represents a causal role of RE in the etiology of POAG remains unknown.To evaluate shared genetic influences and investigate the association of myopic RE with the risk for POAG.Observational analyses were used to evaluate the association between mean spherical equivalent (MSE) RE (continuous trait) or myopia (binary trait) and POAG risk in individuals from the Genetic Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging (GERA) cohort. To quantify genetic overlap, genome-wide genetic correlation analyses were performed using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of MSE RE or myopia and POAG from GERA. Potential causal effects were assessed between MSE RE and POAG using 2-sample Mendelian randomization. Genetic variants associated with MSE RE were derived using GWAS summary statistics from a GWAS of RE conducted in 102 117 UK Biobank participants. For POAG, we used GWAS summary statistics from our previous GWAS (3836 POAG cases and 48 065 controls from GERA). Data analyses occurred between July 2020 and October 2021.Our main outcome was POAG risk as odds ratio (OR) caused by per-unit difference in MSE RE (in diopters).Our observational analyses included data for 54 755 non-Hispanic White individuals (31 926 [58%] females and 22 829 [42%] males). Among 4047 individuals with POAG, mean (SD) age was 73.64 (9.20) years; mean (SD) age of the 50 708 controls was 65.38 (12.24) years. Individuals with POAG had a lower refractive MSE and were more likely to have myopia or high myopia compared with the control participants (40.2% vs 34.1%, P = 1.31 × 10-11 for myopia; 8.5% vs 6.8%, P = .004 for high myopia). Our genetic correlation analyses demonstrated that POAG was genetically correlated with MSE RE (rg, -0.24; SE, 0.06; P = 3.90 × 10-5), myopia (rg, 0.21; SE, 0.07; P = .004), and high myopia (rg, 0.23; SE, 0.09; P = .01). Genetically assessed refractive MSE was negatively associated with POAG risk (inverse-variance weighted model: OR per diopter more hyperopic MSE = 0.94; 95% CI, 0.89-0.99; P = .01).These findings demonstrate a shared genetic basis and an association between myopic RE and POAG risk. This may support population POAG risk stratification and screening strategies, based on RE information."

Systematic approaches, similar to agnostic genome-wide analyses, are needed to identify genuine signals.To systematically investigate nongenetic correlates of psychotic experiences through data-driven agnostic analyses and genetically informed approaches to evaluate associations.This cohort study analyzed data from the UK Biobank Mental Health Survey from January 1 to June 1, 2021. An exposome-wide association study was performed in 2 equal-sized split discovery and replication data sets. Variables associated with psychotic experiences in the exposome-wide analysis were tested in a multivariable model. For the variables associated with psychotic experiences in the final multivariable model, the single-nucleotide variant-based heritability and genetic overlap with psychotic experiences using linkage disequilibrium score regression were estimated, and mendelian randomization (MR) approaches were applied to test potential causality. The significant associations observed in 1-sample MR analyses were further tested in multiple sensitivity tests, including collider-correction MR, 2-sample MR, and multivariable MR analyses.After quality control based on a priori criteria, 247 environmental, lifestyle, behavioral, and economic variables.Psychotic experiences.The study included 155 247 participants (87 896 [57%] female; mean [SD] age, 55.94 [7.74] years). In the discovery data set, 162 variables (66%) were associated with psychotic experiences. Of these, 148 (91%) were replicated. The multivariable analysis identified 36 variables that were associated with psychotic experiences. Of these, 28 had significant genetic overlap with psychotic experiences. One-sample MR analyses revealed forward associations with 3 variables and reverse associations with 3. Forward associations with ever having experienced sexual assault and pleiotropy of risk-taking behavior and reverse associations without pleiotropy of experiencing a physically violent crime as well as cannabis use and the reverse association with pleiotropy of worrying too long after embarrassment were confirmed in sensitivity tests. Thus, associations with psychotic experiences were found with both well-studied and unexplored multiple correlated variables. For several variables, the direction of the association was reversed in the final multivariable and MR analyses.The findings of this study underscore the need for systematic approaches and triangulation of evidence to build a knowledge base from ever-growing observational data to guide population-level prevention strategies for psychosis."

We examined 369 Black and 832 White Bogalusa Heart Study (BHS) participants recruited in childhood and followed for approximately 37 years. The multi-ancestry genome-wide polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), and hypertension were tested for an association with incident hypertension and stage 2 hypertension using Cox proportional hazards models. Race-stratified analyses were adjusted for baseline age, age2, sex, body mass index, genetic principal components, and BP. In Black participants, each standard deviation increase in SBP and DBP PRS conferred a 38% (p= 0.009) and 22% (p= 0.02) increased risk of hypertension and a 74% (p&lt; 0.001) and 50% (p&lt; 0.001) increased risk of stage 2 hypertension, respectively, while no association was observed with the hypertension PRSs. In Whites, each standard deviation increase in SBP, DBP, and hypertension PRS conferred a 24% (p&lt; 0.05), 29% (p= 0.01), and 25% (p&lt; 0.001) increased risk of hypertension, and a 27% (p= 0.08), 29% (0.01), and 42% (p&lt; 0.001) increased risk of stage 2 hypertension, respectively. The addition of BP PRSs to the covariable-only models generally improved the C-statistics (p&lt; 0.05).

The recently developed computational methods for addressing the sparsity by imputing missing have their limits when the required minimum data coverage or profiles of the same tissue in other modalities are not available. In this study, we explored the use of transfer learning together with Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to train predictive models for completing methylome profiles with very low coverage (below 2%). Transfer learning was used to leverage less sparse profiles that are typically available for different tissues for the same species, while KL divergence was employed to maximize the usage of information carried in the input data. A deep neural network was adopted to extract both DNA sequence and local methylation patterns for imputation. Our study of training models for completing methylome profiles of bovine oocytes and early embryos demonstrates the effectiveness of transfer learning and KL divergence, with individual increase of 29.98 and 29.43%, respectively, in prediction performance and 38.70% increase when the two were used together.

The present study aimed to investigate the role and underlying regulatory mechanism of non-structural maintenance of chromosome condensin I complex subunit H (NCAPH) in the malignant progression and cisplatin (DDP) resistance of breast cancer cells. Therefore, the mRNA and protein expression levels of NCAPH were first determined in breast cancer cells via reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blotting. Furthermore, following transfection of NCAPH interference plasmids, the effect of NCAPH knockdown on cell proliferation, migration, invasion were also assessed using CCK-8, wound healing and Transwell assays. Apoptosis was evaluated using TUNEL assay, and western blotting was performed in breast cancer cells and DDP-resistant breast cancer cells. The association between NCAPH and its downstream target, aurora kinase B (AURKB), was verified using bioinformatic analysis and the co-immunoprecipitation assay. Furthermore, the effect of AURKB overexpression on the aforementioned processes and the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway were also assessed. The results demonstrated that NCAPH mRNA and protein expression levels were significantly upregulated in breast cancer cells, whereas NCAPH knockdown significantly attenuated the proliferation, migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. NCAPH silencing also exacerbated the apoptosis of DDP-resistant breast cancer cells. AURKB mRNA and protein expression levels were also significantly upregulated in MCF-7 cells, whereas its overexpression significantly reversed the effects of NCAPH knockdown on breast cancer cells and the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Overall, NCAPH knockdown significantly downregulated AURKB mRNA and protein expression levels to block the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and inhibited breast cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and aggravate DDP-resistant breast cancer cell apoptosis, indicating that NCAPH may serve as a promising therapeutic target for breast cancer.Copyright: © Liao et al."
"36042529","OXTR DNA methylation differentiates men on the obesity spectrum with and without binge eating disorder.","Clin Epigenetics","The neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) plays a role in the regulation of eating behavior and metabolism. OXT functioning is altered in patients with eating and weight disorders, and a variant of the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) has been associated with impulsive eating behavior as it is seen in patients with binge eating disorder (BED). Gene × environment interactions could play a role in BED. One mechanism mediating this interaction is the epigenetic alteration of gene expression. We therefore investigated if DNA methylation of the OXTR differs between individuals with obesity depending on a comorbid BED. We analyzed DNA methylation of the OXTR in peripheral blood of 227 individuals on the obesity spectrum (mean age: 40.3 ± 13.1 yrs; mean BMI: 38.6 ± 7.3 kg/m2), 130 of which were diagnosed with BED.There were no overall differences in OXTR methylation between participants with and those without BED (p > 0.05), while both subgroups were comparable regarding age and body mass index (BMI), but significantly differed in sex distribution (p = 0.035). We found no relationship between mean DNA methylation and BMI or self-reported eating disorder (ED) pathology. Analyzing potential sex differences revealed a significantly lower OXTR DNA methylation in male participants with BED as compared to those without BED (p = 0.017). No such difference was found in the female subsample (p > 0.05).Clinically significant binge eating pathology might be associated with lower OXTR DNA methylation exclusively in males. The differential DNA methylation of OXTR in males with BED supports the view that BED represents a phenotype within the obesity spectrum that is characterized by specific vulnerability factors. A better understanding of the epigenetic underpinnings of the OXT system might contribute to the refinement of OXT administration approaches as potential interventions in eating and weight disorders.© 2022.

Multi-omics analysis revealed enhanced chromatin accessibility and gene transcription by SETD2. In both LUAD bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we found that SETD2-associated positive transcription patterns were associated with DNA damage responses. SETD2 knockdown significantly upregulated tumor cell apoptosis, attenuated proliferation and migration of LUAD tumor cells, and enhanced radiosensitivityin vitro. Moreover, SETD2 was a favorably prognostic factor whose effects were antagonized by the m6A-related genes RBM15 and YTHDF3 in LUAD.

Typically, brains had 20 to 60 detectable single-nucleotide mutations, but ~6% of brains harbored hundreds of somatic mutations. Hypermutability was associated with age and damaging mutations in genes implicated in cancers and, in some brains, reflected in vivo clonal expansions. Somatic duplications, likely arising during development, were found in ~5% of normal and diseased brains, reflecting background mutagenesis. Brains with autism were associated with mutations creating putative transcription factor binding motifs in enhancer-like regions in the developing brain.

Despite the increasing adoption of these platforms, their relative potencies and mechanistic differences are incompletely characterized, particularly at human enhancer-promoter pairs. Here, we systematically compared the most widely adopted dCas9-based transcriptional activators, as well as an activator consisting of dCas9 fused to the catalytic core of the human CBP protein, at human enhancer-promoter pairs. We find that these platforms display variable relative expression levels in different human cell types and that their transactivation efficacies vary based upon the effector domain, effector recruitment architecture, targeted locus and cell type. We also show that each dCas9-based activator can induce the production of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) and that this eRNA induction is positively correlated with downstream mRNA expression from a cognate promoter. Additionally, we use dCas9-based activators to demonstrate that an intrinsic transcriptional and epigenetic reciprocity can exist between human enhancers and promoters and that enhancer-mediated tracking and engagement of a downstream promoter can be synthetically driven by targeting dCas9-based transcriptional activators to an enhancer. Collectively, our study provides new insights into the enhancer-mediated control of human gene expression and the use of dCas9-based activators.© The Author(s) 2022.

"35767995","Core transcription programs controlling injury-induced neurodegeneration of retinal ganglion cells.","Neuron","Regulatory programs governing neuronal death and axon regeneration in neurodegenerative diseases remain poorly understood. In adult mice, optic nerve crush (ONC) injury by severing retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons results in massive RGC death and regenerative failure. We performed an in vivo CRISPR-Cas9-based genome-wide screen of 1,893 transcription factors (TFs) to seek repressors of RGC survival and axon regeneration following ONC. In parallel, we profiled the epigenetic and transcriptional landscapes of injured RGCs by ATAC-seq and RNA-seq to identify injury-responsive TFs and their targets. These analyses converged on four TFs as critical survival regulators, of which ATF3/CHOP preferentially regulate pathways activated by cytokines and innate immunity and ATF4/C/EBPγ regulate pathways engaged by intrinsic neuronal stressors. Manipulation of these TFs protects RGCs in a glaucoma model. Our results reveal core transcription programs that transform an initial axonal insult into a degenerative process and suggest novel strategies for treating neurodegenerative diseases.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Through allele-specific genome editing and chromatin interaction analyses of theSox2locus in mouse embryonic stem cells, we found a striking disconnection between transcriptional control and chromatin architecture. We traced nearly allSox2transcriptional activation to a small number of key transcription factor binding sites, whose deletions have no effect on promoter-enhancer interaction frequencies or topological domain organization. Local chromatin architecture maintenance, including at the topologically associating domain (TAD) boundary downstream from theSox2enhancer, is widely distributed over multiple transcription factor-bound regions and maintained in a CTCF-independent manner. Furthermore, partial disruption of promoter-enhancer interactions by ectopic chromatin loop formation has no effect onSox2transcription. These findings indicate that many transcription factors are involved in modulating chromatin architecture independently of CTCF.© 2022 Taylor et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press."

Brown adipose tissue functions to dissipate energy in response to cold exposure or overfeeding. Long noncoding RNAs play important roles in a wide range of biological processes. However, systematic examination of lncRNAs in phenotypically divergent mice has not yet been reported. Here, the lncRNA expression profiles in BAT of HFD-induced C57BL/6J mice were investigated by high-throughput RNA sequencing. Genes that play roles in thermogenesis and related pathways were identified. We found lncRNA (Gm44502) may play a thermogenic role in obesity resistance by interacting with six mRNAs. Our results also indicated that seven differentially expressed lncRNAs (4930528G23Rik, Gm39490, Gm5627, Gm15551, Gm16083, Gm36860, Gm42002) may play roles in reducing heat production in obesity susceptibility by interacting with seven differentially expressed mRNAs.

"35968782","Epigenetics, DNA damage, and aging.","J Clin Invest","Over the course of a human lifespan, genome integrity erodes, leading to an increased abundance of several types of chromatin changes. The abundance of DNA lesions (chemical perturbations to nucleotides) increases with age, as does the number of genomic mutations and transcriptional disruptions caused by replication or transcription of those lesions, respectively. At the epigenetic level, precise DNA methylation patterns degrade, likely causing increasingly stochastic variations in gene expression. Similarly, the tight regulation of histone modifications begins to unravel. The genomic instability caused by these mechanisms allows transposon element reactivation and remobilization, further mutations, gene dysregulation, and cytoplasmic chromatin fragments. This cumulative genomic instability promotes cell signaling events that drive cell fate decisions and extracellular communications known to disrupt tissue homeostasis and regeneration. In this Review, we focus on age-related epigenetic changes and their interactions with age-related genomic changes that instigate these events."

Climate change is intertwined with air pollution and influences air quality. There is increasing evidence demonstrating the unique vulnerability in the development of adverse health consequences from exposures during the preconception, prenatal, and early postnatal periods, as well as promising indications that policies aimed at addressing these toxicants have improved birth outcomes. Advocacy by neonatal-perinatal providers articulating the potential impact of pollutants on newborns and mothers is essential to promoting improvements in air quality and reducing exposures.

"35987825","Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) reveals evidence of antagonistic pleiotropy in the regulation of the aging process.","Cell Mol Life Sci","The antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis is a well-known evolutionary theory to explain the aging process. It proposes that while a particular gene may possess beneficial effects during development, it can exert deleterious properties in the aging process. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) has a significant role during embryogenesis, but later in life, it promotes several age-related degenerative processes. For instance, AhR factor (i) controls the pluripotency of stem cells and the stemness of cancer stem cells, (ii) it enhances the differentiation of embryonal stem cells, especially AhR signaling modulates the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells, (iii) it also stimulates the differentiation of immunosuppressive Tregs, Bregs, and M2 macrophages, and finally, (iv) AhR signaling participates in the differentiation of many peripheral tissues. On the other hand, AhR signaling is involved in many processes promoting cellular senescence and pathological processes, e.g., osteoporosis, vascular dysfunction, and the age-related remodeling of the immune system. Moreover, it inhibits autophagy and aggravates extracellular matrix degeneration. AhR signaling also stimulates oxidative stress, promotes excessive sphingolipid synthesis, and disturbs energy metabolism by catabolizing NAD+degradation. The antagonistic pleiotropy of AhR signaling is based on the complex and diverse connections with major signaling pathways in a context-dependent manner. The major regulatory steps include, (i) a specific ligand-dependent activation, (ii) modulation of both genetic and non-genetic responses, (iii) a competition and crosstalk with several transcription factors, such as ARNT, HIF-1α, E2F1, and NF-κB, and (iv) the epigenetic regulation of target genes with binding partners. Thus, not only mTOR signaling but also the AhR factor demonstrates antagonistic pleiotropy in the regulation of the aging process.© 2022. The Author(s)."

It is time to emphasize the role of environmental factors as contributory factors or determinants of both global and individual health levels, and to consider them together as a health priority, as enviropathies (meant as pathologies caused, triggered or worsened by environmental exposure). Bringing attention to harmful air pollution exposure has fostered population studies, which developed accurate quantification of environmental exposure in polluted regions, aiding our understanding of the dose-response relationship between pollutants and diseases. Those efforts have influenced local and global health policy strategies. Now we face the challenge of controlling environmental pollution and limiting individual exposure to prevent or avoid serious health risks.

Cognitive performance, percent methylation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor (AHRR) gene, and abstinence duration were used as references to supervise a multimodal fusion analysis of functional, structural, and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, in order to identify associated brain networks in smokers and ex-smokers. Correlations among these networks and with smoking-related measures were performed. Cognition-, methylation-, and abstinence duration-associated networks discriminated between smokers and ex-smokers and correlated with differences in fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF) values, gray matter volume (GMV), and fractional anisotropy (FA) values. Long-term smoking cessation was associated with more accurate cognitive performance, as well as lower fALFF and more GMV in the hippocampus complex. The methylation- and abstinence duration-associated networks positively correlated with smoking-related measures of abstinence duration and percent methylation, respectively, suggesting they are complementary measures. This analysis revealed structural and functional co-alterations linked to smoking abstinence and cognitive performance in brain regions including the insula, frontal gyri, and lingual gyri. Furthermore,AHRRmethylation, a promising epigenetic biomarker of smoking recency, may provide an important complement to self-reported abstinence duration.Copyright © 2022 Qi, Fu, Wu, Calhoun, Zhang, Daughters, Hsu, Jiang, Vergara, Sui and Addicott."

Studies from mapping molecular alterations in early CRC lesions and use of experimental models suggest that the intricate dependencies of various genetic and epigenetic hits shape the early development of CRC via different pathways and its manifestation into various CRC subtypes.

Therefore, c-Met is a promising target for the treatment of digestive system tumors. Many anti-tumor therapies targeting c-Met (tyrosine kinase inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, and adoptive immunotherapy) have been developed in treating digestive system tumors. Some drugs have been successfully applied to clinic, but most of them are defective due to their efficacy and complications. In order to promote the clinical application of targeting c-Met drugs in digestive system tumors, it is necessary to further explore the mechanism of c-Met action in digestive system tumors and optimize the anti-tumor treatment of targeting c-Met drugs.

Among all the proposed software tools, there's the need to combine high statistical power together with a user-friendly framework, making it difficult to choose the best method for a particular experimental environment.We propose SEMgsa, a topology-based algorithm developed into the framework of structural equation models. SEMgsa combine the SEM p values regarding node-specific group effect estimates in terms of activation or inhibition, after statistically controlling biological relations among genes within pathways. We used SEMgsa to identify biologically relevant results in a Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) RNA-seq dataset (GEO accession: GSE172114) together with a frontotemporal dementia (FTD) DNA methylation dataset (GEO accession: GSE53740) and compared its performance with some existing methods. SEMgsa is highly sensitive to the pathways designed for the specific disease, showing low p values ([Formula: see text]) and ranking in high positions, outperforming existing software tools. Three pathway dysregulation mechanisms were used to generate simulated expression data and evaluate the performance of methods in terms of type I error followed by their statistical power. Simulation results confirm best overall performance of SEMgsa.SEMgsa is a novel yet powerful method for identifying enrichment with regard to gene expression data.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible, progressive neurodegenerative brain disorder and the most common form of dementia in the elderly with a long presymptomatic phase. Worldwide, approximately 50 million people are living with dementia, with AD comprising 60-70% of cases. Pathologically, AD is characterized by the deposition of amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) in the neuropil (neuritic plaques) and blood vessels (amyloid angiopathy), and by the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau in neurons (neurofibrillary tangles) in the brain, with associated loss of synapses and neurons, together with glial activation, and neuroinflammation, resulting in cognitive deficits and eventually dementia. The current competitive landscape in AD consists of symptomatic treatments, of which there are currently six approved medications: three AChEIs (donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine), one NMDA-R antagonist (memantine), one combination therapy (memantine/donepezil), and GV-971 (sodium oligomannate, a mixture of oligosaccharides derived from algae) only approved in China. Improvements to the approved therapies, such as easier routes of administration and reduced dosing frequencies, along with the developments of new strategies and combined treatments are expected to occur within the next decade and will positively impact the way the disease is managed. Recently, Aducanumab, the first disease-modifying therapy (DMT) has been approved for AD, and several DMTs are in advanced stages of clinical development or regulatory review. Small molecules, mAbs, or multimodal strategies showing promise in animal studies have not confirmed that promise in the clinic (where small to moderate changes in clinical efficacy have been observed), and therefore, there is a significant unmet need for a better understanding of the AD pathogenesis and the exploration of alternative etiologies and therapeutic effective disease-modifying therapies strategies for AD. Therefore, a critical review of the disease-modifying therapy pipeline for Alzheimer's disease is needed."

However, developmental programming effects during early life, including maternal care and parent-of-origin-dependent expression of imprinted genes, can also contribute to variation in physical activity. Here, we used cross-fostering to address two questions. First, do HR mice have altered DNA methylation profiles of imprinted genes in the brain compared to C mice? Second, does maternal upbringing further modify the DNA methylation status of these imprinted genes? To address these questions, we cross-fostered all offspring at birth to create four experimental groups: C pups to other C dams, HR pups to other HR dams, C pups to HR dams, and HR pups to C dams. Bisulfite sequencing of 16 imprinted genes in the cortex and hippocampus revealed that the HR line had altered DNA methylation patterns of the paternally imprinted genes, Rasgrf1 and Zdbf2, as compared with the C line. Both fostering between the HR and C lines and sex modified the DNA methylation profiles for the paternally expressed genes Mest, Peg3, Igf2, Snrpn, and Impact. Ig-DMR, a gene with multiple paternal and maternal imprinted clusters, was also affected by maternal upbringing and sex. Our results suggest that differential methylation patterns of imprinted genes in the brain could contribute to evolutionary increases in wheel-running behavior and are also dependent on maternal upbringing and sex.© 2022.

However, the effect of prenatal exposure to maternal smoking on child brain development has yet to be elucidated.To investigate the association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and offspring brain development in preadolescence as well as the mediating pathways.This prospective, population-based cohort study was embedded in the Generation R Study, Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The Generation R Study was launched in 2002, with follow-up ongoing. Child brain morphology was assessed at 9 to 11 years of age (ie, 10-12 years between exposure and outcome assessment). Data analysis was performed from March 1, 2021, to February 28, 2022, and at the time of manuscript revision. Participants included the singleton children of pregnant women residing in the study area with an expected date of delivery between April 1, 2002, and January 31, 2006; 2704 children with information on maternal smoking during pregnancy and structural neuroimaging at 9 to 11 years of age were included. A subsample of 784 children with data on DNA methylation at birth was examined in the mediation analysis.Information on maternal smoking during pregnancy was collected via a questionnaire in each trimester. As a contrast, paternal smoking was assessed at recruitment.Brain morphology, including brain volumes and surface-based cortical measures (thickness, surface area, and gyrification), was assessed with magnetic resonance imaging. For mediation analysis, DNA methylation at birth was quantified by a weighted methylation risk score.The 2704 participating children (1370 [50.7%] girls and 1334 [49.3%] boys) underwent brain imaging assessment at a mean (SD) age of 10.1 (0.6) years. Compared with nonexposed children (n = 2102), exposure to continued maternal smoking during pregnancy (n = 364) was associated with smaller total brain volume (volumetric difference [b] = -14.5 [95% CI, -25.1 to -4.0] cm3), cerebral gray matter volume (b = -7.8 [95% CI, -13.4 to -2.3] cm3), cerebral white matter volume (b = -5.9 [95% CI, -10.7 to -1.0] cm3), and surface area and less gyrification. These associations were not explained by paternal smoking nor mediated by smoking-associated DNA methylation patterns at birth. Children exposed to maternal smoking only in the first trimester (n = 238) showed no differences in brain morphology compared with nonexposed children.The findings of this cohort study suggest that continued maternal tobacco use during pregnancy was associated with lower brain volumes and suboptimal cortical traits of offspring in preadolescence, which seemed to be independent of shared family factors. Tobacco cessation before pregnancy, or as soon as pregnancy is known, should be recommended to women for optimal brain development of their offspring."

This complexity is further exacerbated by the several cell types that are implicated in Psoriasis's progression, including keratinocytes, melanocytes and various immune cell types. The observed interactions between the genetic substrate and the environment lead to epigenetic alterations that directly or indirectly affect gene expression. Changes in DNA methylation and histone modifications that alter DNA-binding site accessibility, as well as non-coding RNAs implicated in the post-transcriptional regulation, are mechanisms of gene transcriptional activity modification and therefore affect the pathways involved in the pathogenesis of Psoriasis. In this review, we summarize the research conducted on the environmental factors contributing to the disease onset, epigenetic modifications and non-coding RNAs exhibiting deregulation in Psoriasis, and we further categorize them based on the under-study cell types. We also assess the recent literature considering therapeutic applications targeting molecules that compromise the epigenome, as a way to suppress the inflammatory cutaneous cascade."

Here, we sequenced 60 indigenous Sudanese cattle from six indigenous breeds and analysed the data using three genomic scan approaches to unravel cattle adaptation to the African dryland region.We identified a set of gene-rich selective sweep regions, detected mostly on chromosomes 5, 7 and 19, shared across African and Gir zebu. These include genes involved in immune response, body size and conformation, and heat stress response. We also identified selective sweep regions unique to Sudanese zebu. Of these, a 250 kb selective sweep on chromosome 16 spans seven genes, including PLCH2, PEX10, PRKCZ, and SKI, which are involved in alternative adaptive metabolic strategies of insulin signalling, glucose homeostasis, and fat metabolism.Our results suggest that environmental adaptation may involve recent and ancient selection at gene-rich regions, which might be under a common regulatory genetic control, in zebu cattle.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

However, the underlying mechanisms are still unknown. The present study aimed to understand the mechanism of RSA and its relationship with air pollution exposure. We compared data of decidual tissue from individuals with induced abortions and those with RSA by bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS), and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were verified using RT-qPCR and pyrosequencing. A logistic regression model was used to investigate the association between air pollutants exposure and RSA.We identified 98 DEGs with aberrant methylation by overlapping the RRBS and RNA-seq data. Nineteen immune cell subsets were identified. Compared with normal controls, NK cells and macrophages accounted for different proportions in the decidua of patients with RSA. We observed that the methylation and expression of IGF2BP1 were different between patients with RSA and controls. Furthermore, we observed significant positive associations between maternal air pollutants exposure during the year prior to pregnancy and in early pregnancy and the risk of RSA. Mediation analyses suggested that 24.5% of the effects of air pollution on the risk of RSA were mediated through IGF2BP1 methylation.These findings reveal a comprehensive cellular and molecular mechanism of RSA and suggest that air pollution might cause pregnancy loss by affecting the methylation level of the IGF2BP1 promoter.© 2022.

Alcohol consumption, sleep time, smoking habit and physical activity were the most studied environmental factors with significant G × E interactions. The implementation of more comprehensive GWAS will provide a better understanding of the metabolic processes that determine individual responses to environmental exposures and their association with the development of chronic diseases such as obesity and the metabolic syndrome.

"35992589","Panic disorder aging characteristics: The role of telomerase reverse transcriptase gene and brain function.","Front Aging Neurosci","Panic disorder (PD) causes serious functional damage and disability and accelerates the process of individual aging. The pathological basis of PD is the same as that of age-related diseases, which is proposed as a new viewpoint in recent years. Memory decline and social functional impairment are common manifestations of accelerated aging in PD. The function of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and telomere length (TL) is abnormal in patients with aging and PD. However, the molecular mechanism behind remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between TERT gene expression (including DNA methylation) and the changes in PD aging characteristics (memory and social function). By TERT gene knockout mice, we found that loss of TERT attenuated the acquisition of recent fear memory during contextual fear conditioning. This study reported that a significantly lower methylation level of human TERT (hTERT) gene was detected in PD patients compared with healthy control and particularly decreased CpG methylation in the promoter region of hTERT was associated with the clinical characteristics in PD. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) analysis showed that the methylation of hTERT (cg1295648) influenced social function of PD patients through moderating the function of the left postcentral gyrus (PCG). This indicates that the hTERT gene may play an important role in the pathological basis of PD aging and may become a biological marker for evaluating PD aging. These findings provide multidimensional evidence for the underlying genetic and pathological mechanisms of PD.Copyright © 2022 Ding, Zhong, Liu, Wu, Xu, Wu, Liu, Yuan, Zhou and Wang."

We used online databases (PubMed/Medline/PubMed Central, Science Direct, and Google Scholar) to search the studies relevant to our topic. We screened the papers by titles, abstracts, and then full-text availability. The screened articles were checked for eligibility using relevant quality assessment tools for each study design, extracting and analyzing the data. We finalized 30 studies after the screening; 14 were ineligible. Our final selection included 16 high-quality papers - 13 prospective cohort studies, two review articles, and one meta-analysis. We found a wide range of neurodevelopmental outcomes in our data collection. So, we included autism spectrum disorders, intelligent quotient (IQ), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), isolated language, attention and executive function, communication, behavior, and psychomotor development. All studies showed an association between acetaminophen use and listed neurodevelopmental outcomes. Long-term use, increased dose, and frequency were associated with a stronger association. We extracted collective evidence from 16 studies suggesting acetaminophen's role in developing adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes.

We find that responding tumours display on/fast-off kinetics of type-I-interferon (IFN) signaling. Phenocopying of this kinetics using time-dependent sequential dosing of recombinant IFNs and neutralizing antibodies markedly improves ICB efficacy, but only when IFNβ is targeted, not IFNα. We identify Ly6C+/CD11b+inflammatory monocytes as the primary source of IFNβ and find that active type-I-IFN signaling in tumour-infiltrating inflammatory monocytes is associated with T cell expansion in patients treated with ICB. Together, our results suggest that on/fast-off modulation of IFNβ signaling is critical to the therapeutic response to ICB, which can be exploited to drive clinical outcomes towards response.© 2022.

"35932011","Phosphoproteome profiling of mouse liver during normal aging.","Proteome Sci","Aging is a complex biological process accompanied by a time-dependent functional decline that affects most living organisms. Omics studies help to comprehensively understand the mechanism of aging and discover potential intervention methods. Old mice are frequently obese with a fatty liver.We applied mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics to obtain a global phosphorylation profile of the liver in mice aged 2 or 18 months. MaxQuant was used for quantitative analysis and PCA was used for unsupervised clustering.Through phosphoproteome analysis, a total of 5,685 phosphosites in 2,335 proteins were filtered for quantitative analysis. PCA analysis of both the phosphoproteome and transcriptome data could distinguish young and old mice. However, from kinase prediction, kinase-substrate interaction analysis, and KEGG functional enrichment analysis done with phosphoproteome data, we observed high phosphorylation of fatty acid biosynthesis, β-oxidation, and potential secretory processes, together with low phosphorylation of the Egfr-Sos1-Araf/Braf-Map2k1-Mapk1 pathway and Ctnnb1 during aging. Proteins with differentially expressed phosphosites seemed more directly related to the aging-associated fatty liver phenotype than the differentially expressed transcripts. The phosphoproteome may reveal distinctive biological functions that are lost in the transcriptome.In summary, we constructed a phosphorylation-associated network in the mouse liver during normal aging, which may help to discover novel antiaging strategies.© 2022.

"35947657","Co-option of the piRNA pathway to regulate neural crest specification.","Sci Adv","Across Metazoa, Piwi proteins play a critical role in protecting the germline genome through piRNA-mediated repression of transposable elements. In vertebrates, activity of Piwi proteins and the piRNA pathway was thought to be gonad specific. Our results reveal the expression of Piwil1 in a vertebrate somatic cell type, the neural crest. Piwil1 is expressed at low levels throughout the chicken neural tube, peaking in neural crest cells just before the specification event that enables epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and migration into the periphery. Loss of Piwil1 impedes neural crest specification and emigration. Small RNA sequencing reveals somatic piRNAs with sequence signatures of an active ping-pong loop. RNA-seq and functional experiments identify the transposon-derived gene ERNI as Piwil1's target in the neural crest. ERNI, in turn, suppressesSox2to precisely control the timing of neural crest specification and EMT. Our data provide mechanistic insight into a novel function of the piRNA pathway as a regulator of somatic development in a vertebrate species."

There is compelling evidence that hereditary factors contribute to the development of T2D. Clinical trials in T2D have mostly focused on genes and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in protein-coding areas. Recently, it was revealed that SNPs located in noncoding areas also play a significant impact on disease vulnerability. It is required for cell type-specific gene expression. However, the precise mechanism by which T2D risk genes and SNPs work remains unknown. We integrated risk genes and SNPs from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and performed comprehensive bioinformatics analyses to further investigate the functional significance of these genes and SNPs. We identified four intriguing transcription factors (TFs) associated with T2D. The analysis revealed that the SNPs are engaged in chromatin interaction regulation and/or may have an effect on TF binding affinity. The Gene Ontology (GO) study revealed high enrichment in a number of well-characterized signaling pathways and regulatory processes, including the STAT3 and JAK signaling pathways, which are both involved in T2D metabolism. Additionally, a detailed KEGG pathway analysis identified two major T2D genes and their prospective therapeutic targets. Our findings underscored the potential functional significance of T2D risk genes and SNPs, which may provide unique insights into the disease's pathophysiology."

We aimed to determine the effects of CD36 gene polymorphisms and hypermethylation on the plasma CD36 protein levels in type 2 diabetes.We conducted a cross-sectional study involving 100 females (lean healthy control subjects and subjects with type 2 diabetes). This study was conducted at the Human Physiology Laboratory at the Dakar Faculty of Medicine in Senegal. Circulating sCD36 levels and DNA methyltransferase 3a levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The other biological parameters were evaluated in a biochemical laboratory. CD36 gene polymorphisms and methylation were explored by real-time polymerase chain reaction and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction, respectively.sCD36 was negatively correlated with HDL-cholesterol levels (r =  - 0.52 p = 0.0001) and triglyceride levels (r =  - 0.36 p = 0.01) in control subjects. However, in the type 2 diabetes group, sCD36 levels were positively correlated with total cholesterol levels (r = 0.28 p = 0.04). For rs3211867, control subjects harboring the CC genotypes had significantly higher sCD36 levels than control subjects harboring the AA/AC genotype (p = 0.02); in the type 2 diabetes group, the sCD36 level was not significantly lower in subjects harboring the AA/AC genotype than in subjects harboring the CC genotype (p = 0.27). CD36 gene methylation reduced the sCD36 level in the control subjects compared to control subjects without CD36 gene methylation (p = 0.03). This difference was not significant in the type 2 diabetes group comparing subjects with diabetes with CD36 gene methylation to subjects with diabetes without CD36 gene methylation (p = 0.09). We noted a nonsignificant increase in sCD36 levels in subjects with diabetes with CD36 gene methylation compared to control subjects with CD36 gene methylation (p = 0.27). A combination of the CD36 polymorphism effect and the CD36 methylation effect did not significantly reduce sCD36 levels in subjects with type 2 diabetes.CD36 gene polymorphisms and CD36 gene methylation separately reduce sCD36 levels. Their impacts are compensated for in subjects with type 2 diabetes by an increase in sCD36 levels, the mechanism of which needs to be elucidated.© 2022. The Author(s)."

This study was aimed to reveal metabolomic signatures in diabetes development and progression.In this cross-sectional study, we compared healthy (n = 30), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (n = 30), and DKD (n = 30) subjects with the goal of identifying gradual altering metabolites. Then, a prospective study was performed in T2DM patients to evaluate these altered metabolites in the onset of DKD. Logistic regression was conducted to predict rapid eGFR decline in T2DM subjects using altered metabolites. The prospective association of metabolites with the risk of developing DKD was examined using logistic regression and restricted cubic spline regression models.In this cross-sectional study, impaired amino acid metabolism was the main metabolic signature in the onset and development of diabetes, which was characterized by increased N-acetylaspartic acid, L-valine, isoleucine, asparagine, betaine, and L-methionine levels in both the T2DM and DKD groups. These candidate metabolites could distinguish the DKD group from the T2DM group. In the follow-up study, higher baseline levels of L-valine and isoleucine were significantly associated with an increased risk of rapid eGFR decline in T2DM patients. Of these, L-valine and isoleucine were independent risk factors for the development of DKD. Notably, nonlinear associations were also observed for higher baseline levels of L-valine and isoleucine, with an increased risk of DKD among patients with T2DM.Amino acid metabolism was disturbed in diabetes, and N-acetylaspartic acid, L-valine, isoleucine, asparagine, betaine, and L-methionine could be biomarkers for the onset and progression of diabetes. Furthermore, high levels of L-valine and isoleucine may be risk factors for DKD development."

"35990770","A chromatin remodeling checkpoint of diet-induced macrophage activation in adipose tissue.","Metabol Open","The interplay between the environment and the immune cells is linked to metabolic homeostasis under physiologic and pathophysiologic conditions. Diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2D) is considered an immune-related inflammatory disorder, in which the adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) are key players orchestrating metabolic chronic meta-inflammation and contributing to the pathogenesis of metabolic disease. However, the molecular regulators that integrate the environmental signals to control ATM activation and adipose inflammation during obesity and T2D remain unclear. Epigenetic mechanisms constitute important parameters in metabolic homeostasis, obesity and T2D via the integration of the environmental factors to the transcriptional regulation of gene programs. In a very recent study published in Diabetes by Kong et al., BAF60a has been identified as a key chromatin remodeling checkpoint factor that associates obesity-associated stress signals with meta-inflammation and systemic homeostasis. Furthermore, this work uncovers Atf3 as an important downstream effector in BAF60a-mediated chromatin remodeling and transcriptional reprogramming of macrophage activation in adipose tissue. The findings of this research may contribute to the development of new therapeutic approaches for obesity-induced metabolic inflammation and associated metabolic disorders.© 2022 The Author(s)."

In this study, we have examined the association between polymorphisms and hypermethylation of the CD36 gene promoter with obesity in Senegalese females with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus to identify novel molecular markers of these pathologies (obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus).The study was conducted in Senegal with healthy lean control, obese, and obese diabetic (age; 49.98 years ± 7.52 vs 50.50 years ± 8.76 vs 51.06 ± 5.78, and body mass index (BMI); 24.19 kg/m2 ± 2.74 vs 34.30 kg/m2 ± 4.41 vs 33.09 kg/m2 ± 4.30). We determined three genetic polymorphisms of CD36 i.e., rs1761667, rs1527483, and rs3211867 by real-time polymerase chain reaction, and methylation of CPG islands of CD36 was assessed by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MS-PCR) in DNA isolated from peripheral blood of each participant. Plasma sCD36 levels and DNA methyltransferase 3a (DNMT3a) levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). According to the standard laboratory protocol, all biochemical parameters were analyzed from fasting serum or plasma.For rs1761667, obese and obese diabetic subjects had statistically significant different parameters depending on the genotypic distribution. These were waist size for obese and HDL cholesterol for obese diabetic, they were significantly higher in subjects harboring GG genotype of rs1761667 (respectively p = 0.04 and p = 0.04). For rs3211867, obese subjects harboring the AA/AC genotype had significantly higher BMI (p = 0.02) and total cholesterol (p = 0.03) than obese subjects harboring the CC genotype. At the same time, the obese diabetic subjects harboring the AA/AC genotype had total cholesterol levels significantly higher than the obese diabetic subjects harboring the CC genotype (p = 0.03). For rs1527483, only the control subjects had statistically significant different parameters depending on the genotypic distribution. The control subjects harboring the GG genotype had a significantly higher BMI than the control subjects harboring the AA/AG genotype (p = 0.003). The CD36 gene methylation was significantly 1.36 times more frequent in obese and obese diabetic compared to lean control (RR = 1.36; p = 0.04). DNMT3a levels were higher in subjects with CD36 gene methylation than in subjects without CD36 gene methylation in each group. Obese diabetic subjects with CD36 gene methylation had significantly fewer plasmas sCD36 (p = 0.03) and more LDL-cholesterol (p = 0.01) than obese diabetic subjects without CD36 gene methylation. In the control group, an increase in sCD36 levels would be associated with a decrease in total cholesterol and triglyceride levels (coef = -7647.56 p = 0.01 and coef = -2528.50 p = 0.048, respectively) would be associated with an increase in LDL cholesterol levels. For the obese group, an increase in sCD36 levels would be associated with an increase in fasting insulin levels (coef = 490.99 p = 0.02) and a decrease in glycated hemoglobin levels (coef = -1196.26 p = 0.03). An increase in the sCD36 levels would be associated with an increase in the triglyceride levels in the obese diabetic group (coef = 9937.41 p = 0.02). The AA/AC genotype of SNP rs3211867 polymorphism was significantly associated with CD36 gene methylation in the control and obese diabetic groups (respectively p = 0.05, p = 0.002; 95% CI).These observations suggest that polymorphisms and epigenetic changes in CD36 gene promoters may be implicated in the onset of obesity and its related complication type 2 diabetes mellitus.© 2022.

"35921489","Food Security and Nutrition as the Neglected Missing Links in Cultural Evolution: The Role of the Sociotype.","Rambam Maimonides Med J","Food security and nutrition were major drivers of cultural evolution by enabling sociotypic development and communal living after the Neolithic agricultural revolution some 12,000 years ago. The sociotype unites concepts from the sciences and the humanities; in concert with the genotype it determines an individual's phenotype (observable traits and behavior), and together they advance societal culture. As such, the sociotype relates to an individual's dynamic interactions with the surrounding social environment throughout life and comprises three domains: the Individual, Relationships, and Context. Nutrition affects each domain, respectively, by ensuring the following dimensions of food security: utilization (metabolic fuel and health); accessibility (physical and economic); and availability (the right to nutritious food for all citizens). The sociotype is influenced by multiple factors, including diet-gene interactions, allostasis, microbiota, oxytocin, and culturally through mate selection, family bonds, social communication, political ideologies, and values. Food security, sociotypes, and culture form a complex adaptive system to enable coping with the circumstances of life in health and disease, to achieve sustainable development, and to eradicate hunger. The current geopolitical unrest highlights the absolutely critical role of this system for global security, yet many challenges remain in implementing this paradigm for society. Therefore, sustainable food security must be considered a fundamental human right and responsibility for safeguarding the survival and progress of the sociotypes of humankind (Homo culturus) worldwide."

Deconditioning of several organ systems during flight includes losses to cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle mass, bone density and strength. Similar deconditioning also occurs during prolonged bedrest; any protracted time immobile or inactive, especially for unwell older adults (e.g., confined to hospital beds), can lead to similar detrimental health consequences. Due to limitations in physiological research in space, the six-degree head-down tilt bedrest protocol was developed as ground-based analogue to spaceflight. A variety of exercise countermeasures have been tested as interventions to limit detrimental changes and physiological deconditioning of the musculoskeletal and cardiovascular systems. The Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Canadian Space Agency recently provided funding for research focused on Understanding the Health Impact of Inactivity to study the efficacy of exercise countermeasures in a 14-day randomized clinical trial of six-degree head-down tilt bedrest study in older adults aged 55-65 years old (BROA). Here we will describe the development of a multi-modality countermeasure protocol for the BROA campaign that includes upper- and lower-body resistance exercise and head-down tilt cycle ergometry (high-intensity interval and continuous aerobic exercise training). We provide reasoning for the choice of these modalities following review of the latest available information on exercise as a countermeasure for inactivity and spaceflight-related deconditioning. In summary, this paper sets out to review up-to-date exercise countermeasure research from spaceflight and head-down bedrest studies, whilst providing support for the proposed research countermeasure protocols developed for the bedrest study in older adults.Copyright © 2022 Hedge, Patterson, Mastrandrea, Sonjak, Hajj-Boutros, Faust, Morais and Hughson."

However, emerging evidence is pointing to a neurogenetic profile that may render some individuals more prone than others to focusing on positive information in memory and increasing affective health. The relevance for adaptation to the space environment and the interaction with other stressors such as ionizing radiations is discussed. In particular, to clarify this approach better, we will draw from the psychology and aging literature data. Subsequently, we report on studies on candidate genes for sensitivity to positive memories. We review work on the following candidate genes that may be crucial in adaptation mechanisms: ADRA2B, COMT, 5HTTLPR, CB1, and TOMM40. The final aim is to show how the study of genetics and cell biology of positive memory can help us to reveal the underlying bottom-up pathways to also increasing positive effects during a space mission."

Isolated model organisms can lose microbial diversity over time and humans are likely the same. Decreasing microbial diversity and the subsequent loss of function may accelerate disease progression on Earth, and to an even greater degree in space. For this reason, maintaining a healthy microbiome during spaceflight has recently garnered consideration. Diet, lifestyle, and consumption of beneficial microbes can shape the microbiota, but the replenishment we attain from environmental exposure to microbes is important too. Probiotics, prebiotics, fermented foods, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and other methods of microbiota modulation currently available may be of benefit for shorter trips, but may not be viable options to overcome the unique challenges faced in long-term space travel. Novel fermented food products with particular impact on gut health, immune modulation, and other space-targeted health outcomes are worthy of exploration.

The International Space Station (ISS) is ideal for investigating microbial diversity and virulence associated with spaceflight. The shotgun metagenomics data of the ISS generated during the Microbial Tracking-1 (MT-1) project and resulting metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) across three flights in eight different locations during 12 months were used in this study. The objective of this study was to identify the AMR genes associated with whole genomes of 226 cultivable strains, 21 shotgun metagenome sequences, and 24 MAGs retrieved from the ISS environmental samples that were treated with propidium monoazide (PMA; viable microbes).We have analyzed the data using a deep learning model, allowing us to go beyond traditional cut-offs based only on high DNA sequence similarity and extending the catalog of AMR genes. Our results in PMA treated samples revealed AMR dominance in the last flight for Kalamiella piersonii, a bacteria related to urinary tract infection in humans. The analysis of 226 pure strains isolated from the MT-1 project revealed hundreds of antibiotic resistance genes from many isolates, including two top-ranking species that corresponded to strains of Enterobacter bugandensis and Bacillus cereus. Computational predictions were experimentally validated by antibiotic resistance profiles in these two species, showing a high degree of concordance. Specifically, disc assay data confirmed the high resistance of these two pathogens to various beta-lactam antibiotics.Overall, our computational predictions and validation analyses demonstrate the advantages of machine learning to uncover concealed AMR determinants in metagenomics datasets, expanding the understanding of the ISS environmental microbiomes and their pathogenic potential in humans.

"35982413","Modeled microgravity alters apoptotic gene expression and caspase activity in the squid-vibrio symbiosis.","BMC Microbiol","Spaceflight is a novel and profoundly stressful environment for life. One aspect of spaceflight, microgravity, has been shown to perturb animal physiology thereby posing numerous health risks, including dysregulation of normal developmental pathways. Microgravity can also negatively impact the interactions between animals and their microbiomes. However, the effects of microgravity on developmental processes influenced by beneficial microbes, such as apoptosis, remains poorly understood. Here, the binary mutualism between the bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes, and the gram-negative bacterium, Vibrio fischeri, was studied under modeled microgravity conditions to elucidate how this unique stressor alters apoptotic cell death induced by beneficial microbes.Analysis of the host genome and transcriptome revealed a complex network of apoptosis genes affiliated with extrinsic/receptor-mediated and intrinsic/stress-induced apoptosis. Expression of apoptosis genes under modeled microgravity conditions occurred earlier and at high levels compared to gravity controls, in particular the expression of genes encoding initiator and executioner caspases. Functional assays of these apoptotic proteases revealed heightened activity under modeled microgravity; however, these increases could be mitigated using caspase inhibitors.The outcomes of this study indicated that modeled microgravity alters the expression of both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis gene expression and that this process is mediated in part by caspases. Modeled microgravity-associated increases of caspase activity can be pharmacologically inhibited suggesting that perturbations to the normal apoptosis signaling cascade can be mitigated, which may have broader implications for maintaining animal-microbial homeostasis in spaceflight.© 2022.

"35953721","Cellular senescence and senolytics: the path to the clinic.","Nat Med","Interlinked and fundamental aging processes appear to be a root-cause contributor to many disorders and diseases. One such process is cellular senescence, which entails a state of cell cycle arrest in response to damaging stimuli. Senescent cells can arise throughout the lifespan and, if persistent, can have deleterious effects on tissue function due to the many proteins they secrete. In preclinical models, interventions targeting those senescent cells that are persistent and cause tissue damage have been shown to delay, prevent or alleviate multiple disorders. In line with this, the discovery of small-molecule senolytic drugs that selectively clear senescent cells has led to promising strategies for preventing or treating multiple diseases and age-related conditions in humans. In this Review, we outline the rationale for senescent cells as a therapeutic target for disorders across the lifespan and discuss the most promising strategies-including recent and ongoing clinical trials-for translating small-molecule senolytics and other senescence-targeting interventions into clinical use.© 2022.

Epigenetic modifications play a crucial role in varied biological processes, but the mechanism of histone modification on unloading-induced bone loss has rarely been studied. Here, we discovered for the first time that the methyltransferase Setdb1 was downregulated under the mechanical unloading both in vitro and in vivo so as to attenuate osteoblast proliferation. Furthermore, we found these interesting processes depended on the repression of Macrod2 expression triggered by Setdb1 catalyzing the formation of H3K9me3 in the promoter region. Mechanically, we revealed that Macrod2 was upregulated under mechanical unloading and suppressed osteoblast proliferation through the GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling pathway. Moreover, Atf7ip cooperatively contributed to osteoblast proliferation by changing the localization of Setdb1 under mechanical loading. In summary, this research elucidated the role of the Atf7ip/Setdb1/Macrod2 axis in osteoblast proliferation under mechanical unloading for the first time, which can be a potential protective strategy against unloading-induced bone loss."

Infants with high behavioral and high medical risk were 4 times more likely to have Bayley-III motor scores less than 85 compared with those with low behavioral and low medical risk (adjusted relative risk [aRR], 4.1; 95% CI, 2.9-5.1). Infants with high behavioral and high medical risk also had increased risk for cognitive scores less than 85 (aRR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.8-3.4). Only infants with high behavioral and low medical risk were in the clinical range for CBCL internalizing and total problem scores (internalizing: aRR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.1-4.5; total: aRR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.2-4.4).In this study, high-risk neonatal neurobehavioral patterns at NICU discharge were associated with adverse cognitive, motor, and behavioral outcomes at 2 years. Used in conjunction with medical risk, neonatal neurobehavioral assessments could enhance identification of infants at highest risk for delay and offer opportunities to provide early, targeted therapies."

Therefore, it requires frequent follow-ups, generating costs and making it one of the most expensive neoplasms. Considering the expensive and invasive character of the current gold-standard diagnostic procedure, white-light cystoscopy, efforts to find an alternative method are ongoing. Although the last decade has seen significant advancements in urinary biomarker tests (UBTs) for bladder cancer, international guidelines have not recommended them. Currently, the paramount urgency is to find and validate the test with the best specificity and sensitivity, which would allow for the optimizing of diagnosis, prognosis, and a treatment plan. This review aims to summarise the up-to-date state of knowledge relating to UBTs and new developments in the detection, prognosis, and surveillance of bladder cancer and their potential applications in clinical practice."

The univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to screen out the independent prognostic roles of CBXs in the CGGA database. Cytoscape was used to visualize the functions and related pathways of CBXs in GBM. U251 and U87 glioma cells with gene intervention were used to validate the role of CBX7/8 in tumor proliferation and invasion.

CBX2/3/5/8 were upregulated, whereas CBX6/7 were downregulated at mRNA level in GBM of TCGA and CGGA databases. Similarly, high expression of CBX2/3/5 and low expression of CBX6/8 were further confirmed at the protein level in the HPA. CBX2/6/7 were positively correlated with IDH mutation and CBX1/2/4/5/8 were closely related to GBM subtypes. CBX7 and CBX8 presented the independent prognostic factors for GBM patient survival.

This study was conducted to develop a novel aging-based molecular classification and score system in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC).Integrative analysis of aging-associated genes was performed among ccRCC patients in the TCGA and E-MTAB-1980 cohorts. In accordance with the transcriptional expression matrix of 173 prognostic aging-associated genes, aging phenotypes were clustered with the consensus clustering approach. The agingScore was generated to quantify aging phenotypes with principal component analysis. Tumor-infiltrating immune cells and the cancer immunity cycle were quantified with the ssGSEA approach. Immunotherapy response was estimated through the TIDE algorithm, and a series of tumor immunogenicity indicators were computed. Drug sensitivity analysis was separately conducted based on the GDSC, CTRP, and PRISM analyses.Three aging phenotypes were established for ccRCC, with diverse prognosis, clinical features, immune cell infiltration, tumor immunogenicity, immunotherapeutic response, and sensitivity to targeted drugs. The agingScore was developed, which enabled to reliably and independently predict ccRCC prognosis. Low agingScore patients presented more undesirable survival outcomes. Several small molecular compounds and three therapeutic targets, namely,CYP11A1,SAA1, andGRIK4, were determined for the low agingScore patients.

We present estimates of nuclear histone densities in 373 cancer cell lines, based on Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia data, and we show that a known histone regulator, HMGB1, is linked to histone density aberrations in many cancer cell lines. We further identify an E3 ubiquitin ligase interactor, DCAF6, and a mitochondrial respiratory chain assembly factor, CHCHD4, as histone modulators. As systematic characterization of histone density aberrations in cancer cell lines, this study provides approaches and resources to investigate the impact of histone density on cancer biology.© 2022.

Promoter methylation, however, is not mutually exclusive toTERTactivating genetic alterations, as predicted for functionally redundant mechanisms. To annotate the altered patterns ofTERTpromoter methylation and their relationship with gene expression, we applied a Pacific Biosciences-based, long-read, bisulfite-sequencing technology and compared the differences in the methylation marks between wild-type and mutant cancers in an allele-specific manner.We catalogedTERTgenetic alterations (i.e., promoter point mutations or structural variations), allele-specific promoter methylation patterns, and allele-specific expression levels in a cohort of 54 cancer cell lines. In heterozygous mutant cell lines, the mutant alleles were significantly less methylated than their silent, mutation-free alleles (p&lt; 0.05). In wild-type cell lines, by contrast, both epialleles were equally methylated to high levels at theTERTdistal promoter, but differentially methylated in the proximal regions. ChIP analysis showed that epialleles with the hypomethylated proximal and core promoter were enriched in the active histone mark H3K4me2/3, whereas epialleles that were methylated in those regions were enriched in the repressive histone mark H3K27me3. Decitabine therapy induced biallelic expression in the wild-type cancer cells, whereas the mutant cell lines were unaffected.Long-read bisulfite sequencing analysis revealed differences in the methylation profiles and responses to demethylating agents betweenTERTwild-type and genetically altered cancer cell lines.

"36008466","A high-throughput drug screen reveals means to differentiate triple-negative breast cancer.","Oncogene","Plasticity delineates cancer subtypes with more or less favourable outcomes. In breast cancer, the subtype triple-negative lacks expression of major differentiation markers, e.g., estrogen receptor α (ERα), and its high cellular plasticity results in greater aggressiveness and poorer prognosis than other subtypes. Whether plasticity itself represents a potential vulnerability of cancer cells is not clear. However, we show here that cancer cell plasticity can be exploited to differentiate triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Using a high-throughput imaging-based reporter drug screen with 9 501 compounds, we have identified three polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) inhibitors as major inducers of ERα protein expression and downstream activity in TNBC cells. PLK1 inhibition upregulates a cell differentiation program characterized by increased DNA damage, mitotic arrest, and ultimately cell death. Furthermore, cells surviving PLK1 inhibition have decreased tumorigenic potential, and targeting PLK1 in already established tumours reduces tumour growth both in cell line- and patient-derived xenograft models. In addition, the upregulation of genes upon PLK1 inhibition correlates with their expression in normal breast tissue and with better overall survival in breast cancer patients. Our results indicate that differentiation therapy based on PLK1 inhibition is a potential alternative strategy to treat TNBC.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"36008402","Regulation of neuroendocrine plasticity by the RNA-binding protein ZFP36L1.","Nat Commun","Some small cell lung cancers (SCLCs) are highly sensitive to inhibitors of the histone demethylase LSD1. LSD1 inhibitors are thought to induce their anti-proliferative effects by blocking neuroendocrine differentiation, but the mechanisms by which LSD1 controls the SCLC neuroendocrine phenotype are not well understood. To identify genes required for LSD1 inhibitor sensitivity in SCLC, we performed a positive selection genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 loss of function screen and found that ZFP36L1, an mRNA-binding protein that destabilizes mRNAs, is required for LSD1 inhibitor sensitivity. LSD1 binds and represses ZFP36L1 and upon LSD1 inhibition, ZFP36L1 expression is restored, which is sufficient to block the SCLC neuroendocrine differentiation phenotype and induce a non-neuroendocrine ""inflammatory"" phenotype. Mechanistically, ZFP36L1 binds and destabilizes SOX2 and INSM1 mRNAs, two transcription factors that are required for SCLC neuroendocrine differentiation. This work identifies ZFP36L1 as an LSD1 target gene that controls the SCLC neuroendocrine phenotype and demonstrates that modulating mRNA stability of lineage transcription factors controls neuroendocrine to non-neuroendocrine plasticity.© 2022.

Studies focusing on the gastrointestinal tumors derived from gastrointestinal tissues have raised a question whether these tumors might express higher levels of SARS-CoV-2 associated genes and therefore patients diagnosed with GI cancers may be more susceptible to the infection. In this study, we have analyzed the expression of SARS-CoV-2 associated genes and their co-expressions in gastrointestinal solid tumors, cancer cell lines and patient-derived organoids relative to their normal counterparts. Moreover, we have found increased co-expression of TMPRSS2-TMPRSS4 in gastrointestinal cancers suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 viral infection known to be mediated by this protease pair might facilitate the effects of viral infection in GI cancer patients. Further, our findings also demonstrate that TRIM31 expression is upregulated in gastrointestinal tumors, while the inhibition of TRIM31 significantly altered viral replication and viral processes associated with cellular pathways in gastrointestinal cancer samples. Taken together, these findings indicate that in addition to the co-expression of TMPRSS2-TMPRSS4 protease pair in GI cancers, TRIM31 expression is positively correlated with this pair and TRIM31 may play a role in providing an increased susceptibility in GI cancer patients to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus.© 2022.

Guanine-rich RNA sequence binding factor 1 (GRSF1) participates in multiple biological processes, but its regulatory effect on LUAD remains unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the clinicopathological importance and biological role of GRSF1 in LUAD.The expression of GRSF1 was evaluated using multiple service portals. X-Tile software were used to determine the high and low GRSF1 groups and the relationships between GRSF1 expression and clinicopathological characteristics were then analyzed by R packages. Besides, prognostic significance was identified by the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis 2 (GEPIA2) and Kaplan-Meier (K-M) Plotter. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) was the main outcome of prognosis analysis. The DNA copy number alterations (CNAs) and methylations were calculated using cBioPortal and R packages. The co-expressed genes of GRSF1 were obtained from LinkedOmics, and functional networks were then constructed by R clusterProfiler. Additionally, cell counting kit 8 (CCK-8) and colony formation assays were applied to verify the proliferation effects of GRSF1 on LUAD cells.GRSF1 was significantly upregulated in the LUAD tissues compared to the non-tumor lung tissues (all P<0.05), and its expression was significantly correlated with gender (χ2=6.873, P=0.009) and T classification (χ2=13.62, P=0.003). Higher GRSF1 expression indicated worse OS [hazards ratio (HR) =1.6, P=0.0022] and DFS (HR =1.4, P=0.043), which suggested that GRSF1 was an independent prognostic factor for LUAD. DNA gain/amplification and hypomethylation may also contribute to GRSF1 upregulation. The functional annotation showed that GRSF1 regulates tumorigenesis through several signaling pathways. The knockdown of GRSF1 significantly suppressed lung cancer cell proliferationin vitro.The high expression of GRSF1 indicated an unfavorable prognosis and was closely related to LUAD tumor occurrence and development, which could be used as an effective prognostic biomarker for patients suffering from LUAD.2022 Annals of Translational Medicine.

However, clinical responses to FGFR inhibitors have remained variable1-9, emphasizing the need to better understand which FGFR2 alterations are oncogenic and therapeutically targetable. Here we apply transposon-based screening10,11and tumour modelling in mice12,13, and find that the truncation of exon 18 (E18) of Fgfr2 is a potent driver mutation. Human oncogenomic datasets revealed a diverse set of FGFR2 alterations, including rearrangements, E1-E17 partial amplifications, and E18 nonsense and frameshift mutations, each causing the transcription of E18-truncated FGFR2 (FGFR2ΔE18). Functional in vitro and in vivo examination of a compendium of FGFR2ΔE18and full-length variants pinpointed FGFR2-E18 truncation as single-driver alteration in cancer. By contrast, the oncogenic competence of FGFR2 full-length amplifications depended on a distinct landscape of cooperating driver genes. This suggests that genomic alterations that generate stable FGFR2ΔE18variants are actionable therapeutic targets, which we confirmed in preclinical mouse and human tumour models, and in a clinical trial. We propose that cancers containing any FGFR2 variant with a truncated E18 should be considered for FGFR-targeted therapies.© 2022. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited."

Despite increasing knowledge of such transcriptional programs, the molecular basis of cellular plasticity remains poorly understood. Here, we combine multiplexed transcriptional and protein measurements at population and single-cell levels with multivariate statistical modeling to show that the state of AP-1 transcription factor network plays a unifying role in explaining diverse patterns of plasticity in melanoma. We find that a regulated balance among AP-1 factors cJUN, JUND, FRA2, FRA1, and cFOS determines the intrinsic diversity of differentiation states and adaptive responses to MAPK inhibitors in melanoma cells. Perturbing this balance through genetic depletion of specific AP-1 proteins, or by MAPK inhibitors, shifts cellular heterogeneity in a predictable fashion. Thus, AP-1 may serve as a critical node for manipulating cellular plasticity with potential therapeutic implications.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

However, the attempts at inhibiting PIM2 have yielded underwhelming results in early clinical trials on hematological malignancies. Recently, a novel pan‑PIM inhibitor, JP11646, was developed. The present study examined the utility of targeting PIM2 in multiple solid cancers and investigated the antitumor efficacy and the mechanisms of action of JP11646. When PIM2 expression was compared between normal and cancer tissues in publicly available datasets, PIM2 was found to be overexpressed in several types of solid cancers. PIM2 ectopic overexpression promoted tumor growth inin vivoxenograft breast cancer mouse models. The pan‑PIM inhibitor, JP11646, suppressedin vitrocancer cell proliferation in a concentration‑dependent manner in multiple types of cancers; a similar result was observed with siRNA‑mediated PIM2 knockdown, as well as an increased in cell apoptosis. By contrast, another pan‑PIM inhibitor, AZD1208, suppressed the expression of downstream PIM2 targets, but not PIM2 protein expression, corresponding to no apoptosis induction. As a mechanism of PIM2 protein degradation, it was found that the proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, reversed the apoptosis induced by JP11646, suggesting that PIM2 degradation by JP11646 is proteasome‑dependent. JP11646 exhibited significant anticancer efficacy with minimal toxicities at the examined doses and schedules in multiplein vivomice xenograft solid cancer models. On the whole, the present study demonstrates that PIM2 promotes cancer progression in solid tumors. JP11646 induces apoptosis at least partly by PIM2 protein degradation and suppresses cancer cell proliferationin vitroandin vivo. JP11646 may thus be a possible treatment strategy for multiple types of solid cancers."
"35904277","Metabolic balance in colorectal cancer is maintained by optimal Wnt signaling levels.","Mol Syst Biol","Wnt pathways are important for the modulation of tissue homeostasis, and their deregulation is linked to cancer development. Canonical Wnt signaling is hyperactivated in many human colorectal cancers due to genetic alterations of the negative Wnt regulator APC. However, the expression levels of Wnt-dependent targets vary between tumors, and the mechanisms of carcinogenesis concomitant with this Wnt signaling dosage have not been understood. In this study, we integrate whole-genome CRISPR/Cas9 screens with large-scale multi-omic data to delineate functional subtypes of cancer. We engineer APC loss-of-function mutations and thereby hyperactivate Wnt signaling in cells with low endogenous Wnt activity and find that the resulting engineered cells have an unfavorable metabolic equilibrium compared with cells which naturally acquired Wnt hyperactivation. We show that the dosage level of oncogenic Wnt hyperactivation impacts the metabolic equilibrium and the mitochondrial phenotype of a given cell type in a context-dependent manner. These findings illustrate the impact of context-dependent genetic interactions on cellular phenotypes of a central cancer driver mutation and expand our understanding of quantitative modulation of oncogenic signaling in tumorigenesis.© 2022 The Authors.

InDrosophilaoogenesis, Jak/Stat signaling patterns the epithelial cell fates in early egg chambers but later renders motility to clustered border cells. How Jak/Stat signal spatiotemporally switches static epithelia to motile cells is largely unknown. We report that a nuclear protein, Dysfusion, resides on the inner nuclear membrane and interacts with importin α/β and Nup153 to modulate Jak/Stat signal by attenuating Stat nuclear import. Dysfusion is ubiquitously expressed in oogenesis but specifically down-regulated in border cells when migrating. Increase of nuclear Stat by Dysfusion down-regulation triggers invasive cell behavior and maintains persistent motility. Mammalian homolog of Dysfusion (NPAS4) also negatively regulates the nuclear accumulation of STAT3 and cancer cell migration. Thus, our finding demonstrates that Dysfusion-dependent gating mechanism is conserved and may serve as a therapeutic target for Stat-mediated cancer metastasis."

To uncover how chromosome copy number changes influence the cancer proteome, we conducted an analysis of hundreds of human cancer cell lines and tumors with matched copy number, RNA expression, and protein expression data. We found that a majority of proteins show dosage compensation and fail to change by the degree expected based on chromosome copy number alone. We uncovered a variety of gene groups that were recurrently buffered upon both chromosome gain and loss, including protein complex subunits and cell cycle genes. Several genetic and biophysical factors were predictive of protein buffering, highlighting complex post-translational regulatory mechanisms that maintain appropriate gene product dosage. Finally, we established that chromosomal aneuploidy has a moderate effect on the expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressors, showing that these key cancer drivers can be subject to dosage compensation as well. In total, our comprehensive analysis of aneuploidy and dosage compensation across cancers will help identify the key driver genes encoded on altered chromosomes and will shed light on the overall consequences of aneuploidy during tumor development.© 2022 Schukken and Sheltzer; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press."

The transition from recreational use to pathological consumption is different in each individual, depending on the interaction between environmental and genetic factors. Epigenetic mechanisms are ideal candidates to study psychiatric disorders triggered by these interactions, maintaining persistent malfunctions in specific brain regions. Here we aim to study brain-region-specific epigenetic signatures following exposure to cocaine in a mouse model of addiction to this drug. Extreme subpopulations of vulnerable and resilient phenotypes were selected to identify miRNA signatures for differential vulnerability to cocaine addiction. We used an operant model of intravenous cocaine self-administration to evaluate addictive-like behaviour in rodents based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition criteria to diagnose substance use disorders. After cocaine self-administration, we performed miRNA profiling to compare two extreme subpopulations of mice classified as resilient and vulnerable to cocaine addiction. We found that mmu-miR-34b-5p was downregulated in the nucleus accumbens of vulnerable mice with high motivation for cocaine. On the other hand, mmu-miR-1249-3p was downregulated on vulnerable mice with high levels of motor disinhibition. The elucidation of the epigenetic profile related to vulnerability to cocaine addiction is expected to help find novel biomarkers that could facilitate the interventions to battle this devastating disorder.© 2022 The Authors.

We selected papers that investigated health outcomes during fetal or childhood development in association with early-life ambient or source-specific air pollution exposure. (3) Results: The current literature reports that prenatal and early-childhood exposures to ambient and traffic-related air pollutants are associated with a range of adverse outcomes in early life, including cardiovascular and metabolic, respiratory and allergic, and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Very few studies have investigated associations between wildfire-related air pollution exposure and health outcomes during prenatal, postnatal, or childhood development. (4) Conclusion: Evidence from January 2000 to January 2022 supports a role for prenatal and early-childhood air pollution exposures adversely affecting health outcomes during development. Future studies are needed to identify both detrimental air pollutants from the exposure mixture and critical exposure time periods, investigate emerging exposure sources such as wildfire, and develop feasible interventional tools."
"35948660","Genetic substrates of bipolar disorder risk in Latino families.","Mol Psychiatry","Genetic studies of bipolar disorder (BP) have been conducted in the Latin American population, to date, in several countries, including Mexico, the United States, Costa Rica, Colombia, and, to a lesser extent, Brazil. These studies focused primarily on linkage-based designs utilizing families with multiplex cases of BP. Significant BP loci were identified on Chromosomes 18, 5 and 8, and fine mapping suggested several genes of interest underlying these linkage peaks. More recently, studies in these same pedigrees yielded significant linkage loci for BP endophenotypes, including measures of activity, sleep cycles, and personality traits. Building from findings in other populations, candidate gene association analyses in Latinos from Mexican and Central American ancestry confirmed the role of several genes (including CACNA1C and ANK3) in conferring BP risk. Although GWAS, methylation, and deep sequencing studies have only begun in these populations, there is evidence that CNVs and rare SNPs both play a role in BP risk of these populations. Large segments of the Latino populations in the Americas remain largely unstudied regarding BP genetics, but evidence to date has shown that this type of research can be successfully conducted in these populations and that the genetic underpinnings of BP in these cohorts share at least some characteristics with risk genes identified in European and other populations.© 2022.

"36003340","Prognostic value of <i>SOX9</i> in cervical cancer: Bioinformatics and experimental approaches.","Front Genet","Among gynecological cancers, cervical cancer is a common malignancy and remains the leading cause of cancer-related death for women. However, the exact molecular pathogenesis of cervical cancer is not known. Hence, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying cervical cancer pathogenesis will aid in the development of effective treatment modalities. In this research, we attempted to discern candidate biomarkers for cervical cancer by using multiple bioinformatics approaches. First, we performed differential expression analysis based on cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma data from The Cancer Genome Atlas database, then used differentially expressed genes for weighted gene co-expression network construction to find the most relevant gene module for cervical cancer. Next, the Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses were performed on the module genes, followed by using protein-protein interaction network analysis and Cytoscape to find the key gene. Finally, we validated the key gene by using multiple online sites and experimental methods. Through weighted gene co-expression network analysis, we found the turquoise module was the highest correlated module with cervical cancer diagnosis. The biological process of the module genes focused on cell proliferation, cell adhesion, and protein binding processes, while the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway of the module significantly enriched pathways related to cancer and cell circle. Among the module genes,SOX9was identified as the hub gene, and its expression was associated with cervical cancer prognosis. We found the expression ofSOX9correlates with cancer-associated fibroblast immune infiltration in immune cells by Timer2.0. Furthermore, cancer-associated fibroblast infiltration is linked to cervical cancer patients' prognosis. Compared to those in normal adjacent, immunohistochemical and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) showed that the protein and mRNA expression ofSOX9in cervical cancer were higher. Therefore, theSOX9gene acts as an oncogene in cervical cancer, interactive with immune infiltration of cancer-associated fibroblasts, thereby affecting the prognosis of patients with cervical cancer.Copyright © 2022 Chen, Chen, Zeng, Fu and Huang."

DNA methylation provides promising prognostic biomarkers, which have been used to predict survival and treatment response in solid tumor or plasma samples. This review article presents an overview of recently published computational analyses on DNA methylation for cancer prognosis. To address the challenges of survival analysis with high-dimensional methylation data, various feature selection methods have been applied to screen a subset of informative markers. Using candidate markers associated with survival, prognostic models either predict risk scores or stratify patients into subtypes. The model's discriminatory power can be assessed by multiple evaluation metrics. Finally, we discuss the limitations of existing studies and present the prospects of applying machine learning algorithms to fully exploit the prognostic value of DNA methylation."

Clinical and experimental evidence support the existence of neurophysiological, structural, and functional interdependencies before birth. This investigation provides the first comprehensive transcriptional profile of all three organs during embryonic organogenesis, where differential gene expression gradually assembles the identity and complexity of these proximal organs from a shared origin in the anterior foregut. By applying bulk RNA sequencing and gene network analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) within and across developing embryonic mouse larynx, esophagus, and trachea, we identified co-expressed modules of genes enriched for key biological processes. Organ-specific temporal patterns of gene activity corresponding to gene modules within and across shared tissues during embryonic development (E10.5-E18.5) are described, and the laryngeal transcriptome during vocal fold development and maturation from birth to adulthood is characterized in the context of laryngeal organogenesis. The findings of this study provide new insights into interrelated gene sets governing the organogenesis of this tripartite organ system within the aerodigestive tract.

Chromatin is at the heart of TE regulation; however, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of the precise role of chromatin marks in TE silencing and how chromatin marks are established and maintained at TE loci.

"35728967","Somatic retrotransposition in the developing rhesus macaque brain.","Genome Res","The retrotransposon LINE-1 (L1) is central to the recent evolutionary history of the human genome and continues to drive genetic diversity and germline pathogenesis. However, the spatiotemporal extent and biological significance of somatic L1 activity are poorly defined and are virtually unexplored in other primates. From a single L1 lineage active at the divergence of apes and Old World monkeys, successive L1 subfamilies have emerged in each descendant primate germline. As revealed by case studies, the presently active human L1 subfamily can also mobilize during embryonic and brain development in vivo. It is unknown whether nonhuman primate L1s can similarly generate somatic insertions in the brain. Here we applied approximately 40× single-cell whole-genome sequencing (scWGS), as well as retrotransposon capture sequencing (RC-seq), to 20 hippocampal neurons from two rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). In one animal, we detected and PCR-validated a somatic L1 insertion that generated target site duplications, carried a short 5' transduction, and was present in ∼7% of hippocampal neurons but absent from cerebellum and nonbrain tissues. The corresponding donor L1 allele was exceptionally mobile in vitro and was embedded inPRDM4, a gene expressed throughout development and in neural stem cells. Nanopore long-read methylome and RNA-seq transcriptome analyses indicated young retrotransposon subfamily activation in the early embryo, followed by repression in adult tissues. These data highlight endogenous macaque L1 retrotransposition potential, provide prototypical evidence of L1-mediated somatic mosaicism in a nonhuman primate, and allude to L1 mobility in the brain over the past 30 million years of human evolution.© 2022 Billon et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press."
"35892629","Normal and Pathological NRF2 Signalling in the Central Nervous System.","Antioxidants (Basel)","The nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) was originally described as a master regulator of antioxidant cellular response, but in the time since, numerous important biological functions linked to cell survival, cellular detoxification, metabolism, autophagy, proteostasis, inflammation, immunity, and differentiation have been attributed to this pleiotropic transcription factor that regulates hundreds of genes. After 40 years of in-depth research and key discoveries, NRF2 is now at the center of a vast regulatory network, revealing NRF2 signalling as increasingly complex. It is widely recognized that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a key role in human physiological and pathological processes such as ageing, obesity, diabetes, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. The high oxygen consumption associated with high levels of free iron and oxidizable unsaturated lipids make the brain particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress. A good stability of NRF2 activity is thus crucial to maintain the redox balance and therefore brain homeostasis. In this review, we have gathered recent data about the contribution of the NRF2 pathway in the healthy brain as well as during metabolic diseases, cancer, ageing, and ageing-related neurodegenerative diseases. We also discuss promising therapeutic strategies and the need for better understanding of cell-type-specific functions of NRF2 in these different fields."

However, scientists have realized that information obtained using earlier technology, frequently called 'bulk RNA-seq' data, provides information averaged across all the cells present in a tissue. Relatively newly developed single cell (scRNA-seq) technology allows us to provide transcriptomic information at a single-cell resolution. Nevertheless, these high-resolution data have their own complex natures and demand novel statistical data analysis methods to provide effective and highly accurate results on complex biological systems. In this review, we cover many such recently developed statistical methods for researchers wanting to pursue scRNA-seq statistical and computational research as well as scientific research about these existing methods and free software tools available for their generated data. This review is certainly not exhaustive due to page limitations. We have tried to cover the popular methods starting from quality control to the downstream analysis of finding differentially expressed genes and concluding with a brief description of network analysis."

Because of the current technical limitation, obtaining genome-wide spatial transcriptome at single-cell resolution is challenging. Here, we developed a new algorithm named iSpatial to derive the spatial pattern of the entire transcriptome by integrating spatial transcriptomic and single-cell RNA-seq datasets. Compared to other existing methods, iSpatial has higher accuracy in predicting gene expression and spatial distribution. Furthermore, it reduces false-positive and false-negative signals in the original datasets. By testing iSpatial with multiple spatial transcriptomic datasets, we demonstrate its wide applicability to datasets from different tissues and by different techniques. Thus, we provide a computational approach to reveal spatial organization of the entire transcriptome at single-cell resolution. With numerous high-quality datasets available in the public domain, iSpatial provides a unique way to understand the structure and function of complex tissues and disease processes."

In the crustaceanParhyale, embryonic and regenerating legs differ in gene expression dynamics but produce apparently similar mature structures. We examine the fidelity ofParhyaleleg regeneration using complementary approaches to investigate microanatomy, sensory function, cellular composition, and cell molecular profiles. We find that regeneration precisely replicates the complex microanatomy and spatial distribution of external sensory organs and restores their sensory function. Single-nuclei sequencing shows that regenerated and uninjured legs are indistinguishable in terms of cell-type composition and transcriptional profiles. This remarkable fidelity highlights the ability of organisms to achieve identical outcomes via distinct processes."

Advances in multimodal single-cell measurement technologies provide an opportunity to apply new computational frameworks to dissect the contribution of individual genes and gene combinations to a given phenotype. Using an information theory approach, we analyzed multimodal data of the expression of 83 genes in the Ca2+signaling network and the dynamic Ca2+response in the same cell. We found that the overall expression levels of these 83 genes explain approximately 60% of Ca2+signal entropy. The average contribution of each single gene was 17%, revealing a large degree of redundancy between genes. Using different heuristics, we estimated the dependency between the size of a gene set and its information content, revealing that on average, a set of 53 genes contains 54% of the information about Ca2+signaling. Our results provide the first direct quantification of information content about complex cellular phenotype that exists in mRNA abundance measurements.© 2022 The Authors.

"35858747","Identifying cell state-associated alternative splicing events and their coregulation.","Genome Res","Alternative splicing shapes the transcriptome and contributes to each cell's unique identity, but single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has struggled to capture the impact of alternative splicing. We previously showed that low recovery of mRNAs from single cells led to erroneous conclusions about the cell-to-cell variability of alternative splicing. Here, we present a method, Psix, to confidently identify splicing that changes across a landscape of single cells, using a probabilistic model that is robust against the data limitations of scRNA-seq. Its autocorrelation-inspired approach finds patterns of alternative splicing that correspond to patterns of cell identity, such as cell type or developmental stage, without the need for explicit cell clustering, labeling, or trajectory inference. Applying Psix to data that follow the trajectory of mouse brain development, we identify exons whose alternative splicing patterns cluster into modules of coregulation. We show that the exons in these modules are enriched for binding by distinct neuronal splicing factors and that their changes in splicing correspond to changes in expression of these splicing factors. Thus, Psix reveals cell type-dependent splicing patterns and the wiring of the splicing regulatory networks that control them. Our new method will enable scRNA-seq analysis to go beyond transcription to understand the roles of post-transcriptional regulation in determining cell identity.© 2022 Buen Abad Najar et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press."

Serum cardiometabolic markers (i.e. lipid and glycaemic profile and uric acid) were analysed at late pregnancy and at birth. In placenta, telomeres length, proportion of deleted mitochondrial-DNA and mitochondrial-DNA density, some minerals and interleukin 8, epidermal growth factor, fibroblast growth factor-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor were measured. The study was run between November 2015 and April 2018.Mothers carrying a male showed higher serum triglycerides than mothers carrying a female at late pregnancy (p < .05). Serum total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were greater in males' umbilical cord blood artery compared to females' new-borns (both,p < .05). Mothers of males and male new-borns presented higher uric acid than mothers of females and female new-borns at birth (p < .05). Female's placentas presented greater placental-newborn weight ratio, manganese content and fibroblast growth factor-2 (all,p ⩽ .05), and evidence of statistical significance in telomeres length, which were 17% longer (p = .076).Our findings show weak differences in some cardiometabolic and placental status markers by foetal sex. Notwithstanding, we observed a slightly more proatherogenic profile in both, mothers carrying males' foetuses and male new-borns. We also found lower serum uric acid and better placenta status in mothers carrying a female. These findings indicate that foetal sex might need to be considered for a more personalized follow-up of pregnancies."

However, the relationship between methylation status of TK1 and Immune Infiltrates in Prostate Cancer (PCa) is unknown. The goal of this study was to use comprehensive bioinformatic analyses to elucidate the involvement relationship between methylation status of TK1 and Immune Infiltrates in PCa. TK1 mRNA expression and methylation data in PCa were investigated via GEPIA, TIMER, and UALCAN coupled with MEXPRESS data resources. We employed the LinkedOmics data resource to determine the signaling cascades linked to TK1 expression. Single-cell analysis was performed using the CancerSEA data resource. GeneMANIA and CancerSEA were used to analyze the correlation between TK1 and TK1 coexpressed genes. In addition, TIMER and TISIDB were adopted to assess tumor-invading immune cells and immunomodulators. CTD was utilized to detect the drugs acting on TK1. This study found that TK1 was overexpressed in PCa, and its contents were linked to tumor stage and prognosis. Genes co-expressed with TK1 were enriched in cascades involved in the ribosome, cell cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, DNA replication, oocyte meiosis, and the proteasome. The expression of TK1 along with its methylation status was found to be linked to tumor-invading immune cells, as well as PCa immunomodulators. We also examined the prospect of employing TK1 as a possible target for PCa therapy.

In recent years, an increasing number of studies have reported the important role of competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory networks in various tumors; however, the complexity and specific biological effects of the ceRNA regulatory network of SKCM remain unclear. In the present study, we obtained a ceRNA regulatory network of long non-coding RNAs, microRNAs, and mRNAs related to the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) in SKCM and identified the potential diagnostic and prognostic markers related to SKCM. We extracted the above three types of RNA involved in SKCM from The Cancer Genome Atlas database.

Finally, we determined theOIP5-AS1-PTPRC/IL7R/CD69andMALAT1-IL7R/CD69axes in ceRNA as a clinical prognostic model using correlation and Cox regression analyses. Additionally, we explored the possible role of these two axes in affecting gene expression and immune microenvironment changes and the occurrence and development of SKCM through methylation and immune infiltration analyses.

One of the main functions of peroxisomes is the processing of very-long chain fatty acids into metabolites that can be directed to the mitochondria. One key family of enzymes in this process are the peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidases (ACOX1, ACOX2 and ACOX3), the expression of which has been shown to be dysregulated in some cancers. Very little is however known about the expression of this family of oxidases in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). ACOX2 has however been suggested to be elevated at the mRNA level in over 10% of NSCLC, and in the present study using both standard and bioinformatics approaches we show that expression of ACOX2 is significantly altered in NSCLC. ACOX2 mRNA expression is linked to a number of mutated genes, and associations between ACOX2 expression and tumour mutational burden and immune cell infiltration were explored. Links between ACOX2 expression and candidate therapies for oncogenic driver mutations such as KRAS were also identified. Furthermore, levels of acyl-CoA oxidases and other associated peroxisomal genes were explored to identify further links between the peroxisomal pathway and NSCLC. The results of this biomarker driven study suggest that ACOX2 may have potential clinical utility in the diagnosis, prognosis and stratification of patients into various therapeutically targetable options.© 2022.

The purpose of this study was to identify the potential effect of autophagy-related DNA methylation on the prognosis and immune microenvironment in LGG.The methylation profile, transcription data and corresponding clinical information of 451 patients with LGG were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Another methylation data and clinical information of 110 patients with LGG from Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) were used as the validation set. Through univariate and multivariate COX regression analysis, we identified the autophagy-related genes (ARGs) associated with methylation levels and prognosis, and established a risk assessment signature. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curve were used to verify the model's effectiveness in predicting prognosis. Patients were divided into low- and high-risk groups based on risk scores. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis were used to explore the differences in biological functions between the two groups. ESTIMATE and CIBERSORT algorithms were used to explore differences in immune infiltration and immunotherapy sites. Pearson correlation analysis was used to analyze the relative relationship between methylated cg sites and corresponding genes.A total of 6 ARGs (ARSB,CFLAR,WIPI2,RB1,ERN1,RAB24) were selected that were associated with methylation levels and prognosis. The area under the curve (AUC) =0.96, and the KM survival curve P<0.0001, which proves that the risk assessment model has a good effect in predicting the prognosis of LGG. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis showed that the model mainly involved major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II receptors, antigen processing and presentation, and immune cell differentiation. In addition, we also found differences in immune infiltration and immune checkpoints between high- and low-risk groups.The methylation levels of these 6 ARGs have a strong predictive potential for LGG, and the methylation regulation of ARGs has an important impact on the immune microenvironment of LGGs.2022 Translational Cancer Research.

Hence, herein, we performed a pan-cancer analysis of abnormalRUNXexpression and deciphered the potential regulatory mechanism. Specifically, we used TCGA multi-omics data combined with multiple online tools to analyze transcripts, genetic alterations, DNA methylation, clinical prognoses, miRNA networks, and potential target genes.RUNXgenes are consistently overexpressed in esophageal, gastric, pancreatic, and pan-renal cancers. The total protein expression ofRUNX1in lung adenocarcinoma, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC) is consistent with the mRNA expression results. Moreover, increased phosphorylation on the T14 and T18 residues of RUNX1 may represent potential pathogenic factors. TheRUNXgenes are significantly associated with survival in pan-renal cancer, brain lower-grade glioma, and uveal melanoma. Meanwhile, various mutations and posttranscriptional changes, including theRUNX1D96 mutation in invasive breast carcinoma, the co-occurrence ofRUNXgene mutations in UCEC, and methylation changes in theRUNX2promoter in KIRC, may be associated with cancer development. Finally, analysis of epigenetic regulator co-expression, miRNA networks, and target genes revealed the carcinogenicity, abnormal expression, and direct regulation ofRUNXgenes.We successfully analyzed the pan-cancer abnormal expression and prognostic value ofRUNXgenes, thereby providing potential biomarkers for various cancers.

However, there is lacking systematic assessment of stem-like indices and associations with a response of sorafenib in HCC. Our study thus aimed to evaluate the status of tumor dedifferentiation for HCC and further identify the regulatory mechanisms under the condition of resistance to sorafenib. Datasets of HCC, including messenger RNAs (mRNAs) expression, somatic mutation, and clinical information were collected. The mRNA expression-based stemness index (mRNAsi), which can represent degrees of dedifferentiation of HCC samples, was calculated to predict drug response of sorafenib therapy and prognosis. Next, unsupervised cluster analysis was conducted to distinguish mRNAsi-based subgroups, and gene/geneset functional enrichment analysis was employed to identify key sorafenib resistance-related pathways. In addition, we analyzed and confirmed the regulation of key genes discovered in this study by combining other omics data. Finally, Luciferase reporter assays were performed to validate their regulation. Our study demonstrated that the stemness index obtained from transcriptomic is a promising biomarker to predict the response of sorafenib therapy and the prognosis in HCC. We revealed the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor signaling pathway (the PPAR signaling pathway), related to fatty acid biosynthesis, that was a potential sorafenib resistance pathway that had not been reported before. By analyzing the core regulatory genes of the PPAR signaling pathway, we identified four candidate target genes,retinoid X receptor beta(RXRB),nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group H member 3(NR1H3),cytochrome P450 family 8 subfamily B member 1(CYP8B1) andstearoyl-CoA desaturase(SCD), as a signature to distinguish the response of sorafenib. We proposed and validated that theRXRBandNR1H3could directly regulateNR1H3andSCD, respectively.

Previous studies revealed heterogeneous leukemia cells and their relevant gene markers, such asCRIP1as clinically prognostic in t (8;21) AML patients. However, the expression and role ofCRIP1in AML are poorly understood. We used the single-cell RNA sequencing and gene expression data from t (8;21) AML patients to analyze the immune and regulation networks ofCRIP1. Two independent cohorts from GSE37642 and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets were employed as validation cohorts. In addition, the methylation data from TCGA were used to analyze the methylation effect of theCRIP1expression. Gene expression profile from t (8;21) AML patients showed that theCRIP1-high group exhibited an enrichment of immune-related pathways, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α signaling via nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) pathways. Further studies using CIBERSORT showed that theCRIP1-high group had a significantly higher infiltration of exhausted CD8 T cells and activated mast cells. TheCRIP1expression was validated in the GSE37642-GPL96, GSE37642-GPL570, and TCGA datasets. In addition, with the methylation data, four CpG probes ofCRIP1(cg07065217, cg04411625, cg25682097, and 11763800) were identified as negatively associated with theCRIP1gene expression in AML patients. Our data provide a comprehensive overview of the regulation ofCRIP1expression in AML patients.

The current study starts with a pan-cancer examination of SRR's expression and prognostic value before delving into SRR's potential cancer-suppressing effect in patients with EC. SRR may affect the endometrial tumor immune microenvironment, according to subsequent immune-related analysis. SRR expression is also linked to several genes involved in specific pathways such as ferroptosis, N6-methyladenosine methylation, and DNA damage repair. Finally, we used the expression, correlation, and survival analyses to investigate the upstream potential regulatory non-coding RNAs of SRR. Overall, our findings highlight the prognostic significance of SRR in patients with EC, and we can formulate a reasonable hypothesis that SRR influences metabolism and obstructs key carcinogenic processes in EC.Copyright © 2022 Cui, Mo, Wang, Wang, Cheng, Wang, Yang and Wang."
"35978878","Role of transcribed ultraconserved regions in gastric cancer and therapeutic perspectives.","World J Gastroenterol","Gastric cancer (GC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death. The occurrence and development of GC is a complex process involving multiple biological mechanisms. Although traditional regulation modulates molecular functions related to the occurrence and development of GC, the comprehensive mechanisms remain unclear. Ultraconserved region (UCR) refers to a genome sequence that is completely conserved in the homologous regions of the human, rat and mouse genomes, with 100% identity, without any insertions or deletions, and often located in fragile sites and tumour-related genes. The transcribed UCR (T-UCR) is transcribed from the UCR and is a new type of long noncoding RNA. Recent studies have found that the expression level of T-UCRs changes during the occurrence and development of GC, revealing a new mechanism underlying GC. Therefore, this article aims to review the relevant research on T-UCRs in GC, as well as the function of T-UCRs and their regulatory role in the occurrence and development of GC, to provide new strategies for GC diagnosis and treatment.©The Author(s) 2022.

"35747989","Epigenetic silencing of E-cadherin gene induced by lncRNA MALAT-1 in acute myeloid leukaemia.","J Clin Lab Anal","Epigenetic abnormalities in acute myeloid leukaemia provide us with a target for novel therapeutic strategies. The aim of the study was to verify the epigenetic regulatory mechanism of E-cadherin gene silencing induced by long non-coding RNA MALAT-1 in AML.Expression of MALAT-1, E-cadherin, EZH2, SUZ12 and EED genes in AML patients was detected by RT-qPCR. After MALAT-1 silencing in AML cell lines, levels of the E-cadherin, EZH2, SUZ12, EED, DNMT1, DNMT3A and DNMT3B genes and encoded proteins were detected by RT-qPCR and Western blotting. The level of CpG island methylation and trimethylation modification of histone H3K27 in the promoter region of E-cadherin was detected by pyrosequencing and ChIP-qPCR. RIP-qPCR was used to detect the interaction between MALAT-1 and proteins.MALAT-1, EZH2 and EED gene expression was markedly increased in AML patients with E-cadherin down-regulation. A positive correlation between EZH2 or SUZ12 and MALAT-1 expression was observed. After MALAT-1 silencing, the expression of E-cadherin was up-regulated, whereas the expression of EZH2, SUZ12, DNMT1, DNMT3A and DNMT3B was down-regulated. Results of Western blotting were consistent with those of RT-qPCR. Methylation levels of E-cadherin in AML patients were higher than that in normal controls, which appeared to increase with age. Methylation of the CpG island and H3K27 trimethylation of E-cadherin were decreased after MALAT-1 silencing. RIP-qPCR suggested that MALAT-1 might be enriched by EZH2 and SUZ12.Our findings verified that MALAT-1 might lead to the transcriptional silencing of E-cadherin gene through the trimethylation of H3K27 mediated by recruiting EZH2 and SUZ12.© 2022 The Authors.

"36006053","Residential Wood Burning and Pulmonary Function in the Agricultural Lung Health Study.","Environ Health Perspect","In low- and middle-income countries, burning biomass indoors for cooking or heating has been associated with poorer lung function. In high-income countries, wood, a form of biomass, is commonly used for heating in rural areas with increasing prevalence. However, in these settings the potential impact of chronic indoor woodsmoke exposure on pulmonary function is little studied.We evaluated the association of residential wood burning with pulmonary function in case-control study of asthma nested within a U.S. rural cohort.Using sample weighted multivariable linear regression, we estimated associations between some and frequent wood burning, both relative to no exposure, in relation to forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), their ratio (FEV1/FVC), and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO). We examined effect modification by smoking or asthma status.Among all participants and within smoking groups, wood burning was not appreciably related to pulmonary function. However, in individuals with asthma (n=1,083), frequent wood burning was significantly associated with lowerFEV1[β:-164mL; 95% confidence interval (CI):-261,-66mL], FVC (β:-125mL; 95% CI:-230,-20mL), andFEV1/FVC(β:-2%; 95% CI:-4,-0.4%), whereas no appreciable association was seen in individuals without asthma (n=1,732). These differences in association by asthma were statistically significant forFEV1(pinteraction=0.0044) andFEV1/FVC(pinteraction=0.049). Frequent wood burning was also associated with higher FeNO levels in all individuals (n=2,598;β:0.1 ln(ppb); 95% CI: 0.02, 0.2), but associations did not differ by asthma or smoking status.Frequent exposure to residential wood burning was associated with a measure of airway inflammation (FeNO) among all individuals and with lower pulmonary function among individuals with asthma. This group may wish to reduce wood burning or consider using air filtration devices. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP10734."
"36028576","Shared regulation and functional relevance of local gene co-expression revealed by single cell analysis.","Commun Biol","Most human genes are co-expressed with a nearby gene. Previous studies have revealed this local gene co-expression to be widespread across chromosomes and across dozens of tissues. Yet, so far these studies used bulk RNA-seq, averaging gene expression measurements across millions of cells, thus being unclear if this co-expression stems from transcription events in single cells. Here, we leverage single cell datasets in >85 individuals to identify gene co-expression across cells, unbiased by cell-type heterogeneity and benefiting from the co-occurrence of transcription events in single cells. We discover >3800 co-expressed gene pairs in two human cell types, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) and (i) compare single cell to bulk RNA-seq in identifying local gene co-expression, (ii) show that many co-expressed genes - but not the majority - are composed of functionally related genes and (iii) using proteomics data, provide evidence that their co-expression is maintained up to the protein level. Finally, using single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single cell ATAC-sequencing (scATAC-seq) data for the same single cells, we identify gene-enhancer associations and reveal that >95% of co-expressed gene pairs share regulatory elements. These results elucidate the potential reasons for co-expression in single cell gene regulatory networks and warrant a deeper study of shared regulatory elements, in view of explaining disease comorbidity due to affecting several genes. Our in-depth view of local gene co-expression and regulatory element co-activity advances our understanding of the shared regulatory architecture between genes.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35892587","A Genome-Wide CRISPR Screen Identifies Factors Regulating Pluripotency Exit in Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells.","Cells","Pluripotency maintenance and exit in embryonic stem cells is a focal topic in stem cell biology. However, the effects of screening under very stringent culture conditions (e.g., differentiation medium, no leukemia inhibitory factor, no chemical inhibitors such as PD0325901 and CHIR99021, and no feeder cells) and of prolonging culture for key factors that regulate pluripotency exit, have not yet been reported. Here, we used a genome-wide CRISPR library to perform such a screen in mouse embryonic stem cells. Naïve NANOG-GFP mESCs were first transfected with a mouse genome-wide CRISPR knockout library to obtain a mutant mESCs library, followed by screening for two months in a strict N2B27 differentiation medium. The clones that survived our stringent screening were analyzed to identify the inserted sgRNAs. In addition to identifying the enriched genes that were reported in previous studies (Socs3,Tsc1,Trp53,Nf2,Tcf7l1,Csnk1a1, andDhx30), we found 17 unreported genes, among whichZfp771andOlfr769appeared to be involved in pluripotency exit. Furthermore,Zfp771knockout ESCs showed a differentiation delay in embryonic chimera experiments, indicatingZfp771played an important role in pluripotency exit. Our results show that stringent screening with the CRISPR library can reveal key regulators of pluripotency exit."

Genetics and epigenetic mechanisms related to the ACE2 gene are associated with changes in its expression and, therefore, linked to increased susceptibility to infection. Although some variables such as sex, age, and obesity have been described as risk factors for COVID-19, the molecular causes involved in the disease susceptibility are still unknown.To evaluate the ACE2 gene expression profiles and their association with epigenetic mechanisms and demographic or clinical variables.In 500 adult volunteers, the mRNA expression levels of the ACE2 gene in nasopharyngeal swab samples and its methylation status in peripheral blood samples were quantified by RT-qPCR and qMSP, respectively. The existence of significant differences in the ACE2 gene expression and its determinants were evaluated in different study groups according to several demographic or clinical variables such as sex, age, body mass index (BMI), smoking, SARS-CoV-2 infection, and presence of underlying diseases such as type II diabetes mellitus (DM2), asthma and arterial hypertension (AHT).Our results show that ACE2 gene overexpression, directly involved in susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, depends on multiple host factors such as male sex, age over 30 years, smoking, the presence of obesity, and DM2. Likewise, it was determined that the ACE2 gene expression is regulated by changes in the DNA methylation patterns in its promoter region.The ACE2 gene expression is highly variable, and this variability is related to habits such as smoking and demographic or clinical variables, which details the impact of environmental and host factors on our epigenome and, therefore, in susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection.Copyright © 2022 Pontificia Universidad Javeriana.

"35962359","Parents' experiences following conversations about their young child's weight in the primary health care setting: a study within the STOP project.","BMC Public Health","In primary healthcare, conversations between clinicians and parents about young children's overweight are key to providing support and initiating weight management. However, given the sensitivity of this topic, these conversations are difficult for both clinicians and parents and are sometimes delayed or avoided. To understand the emotional impact of these conversations, this study aims to shed light on parents' experiences following conversations with primary care nurses about their child's overweight.Participants were recruited through a childhood obesity randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted in Sweden. Telephone-based semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 parents (mean age 40; the majority were women (n = 12/17), had a university degree (n = 14/17) and were born in Sweden (n = 13/16)). Their children were between 3 and 7 years old (mean age 4.8 years) with overweight (n = 7) or obesity (n = 10). The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis.Two main themes were developed. Theme 1, 'Receiving the overweight/obesity diagnosis', explores parents' reactions to the conversation with the primary care nurse. Depending on how the nurse presented the topic, conversations either fostered an alliance between the parent and the nurse, encouraging parents to reflect and develop insights about the child's and the family's needs (subtheme Conversations that empower), or felt limited, uncomfortable, or belittling (subtheme Conversations that provoke resistance). Theme 2, 'Parenting a child with a formal diagnosis of obesity', explores challenges parents faced following the weight conversations, including managing their own feelings and concerns (subtheme Fear of transferring weight anxiety), dealing with others' reactions (subtheme Involve family and manage surroundings) and asking for and receiving support from health care professionals (subtheme Obtain support from health care professionals).While conversations with primary care nurses about children's weight were often emotional, most parents felt these conversations were ultimately helpful, as they encouraged them to enact positive lifestyle changes. Importantly, when nurses initiated conversations in a responsive, non-blaming way, inviting parents to reflect on their situation, parents felt more supported and empowered. These findings convey the importance of providing communication skills training to pediatric healthcare professionals, with particular focus on childhood overweight and obesity.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03800823 ; 11 Jan 2019.© 2022.

"35996151","Improving on-treatment risk stratification of cancer patients with refined response classification and integration of circulating tumor DNA kinetics.","BMC Med","Significant intertumoral heterogeneity exists as antitumor treatment is introduced. Heterogeneous therapeutic responses are conventionally evaluated by imaging examinations based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST); nevertheless, there are increasing recognitions that they do not fully capture patient clinical benefits. Currently, there is a paucity of data regarding the clinical implication of biological responses assessed by liquid biopsy of on-treatment circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Here, we investigated whether biological response evaluated by ctDNA kinetics added critical information to the RECIST, and whether integrating on-treatment biological response information refined risk stratification of cancer patients.In this population-based cohort study, we included 821 patients with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated nasopharynx of head and neck cancer (NPC) receiving sequential neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and chemoradiotherapy (CRT), who had pretreatment and on-treatment cfEBV DNA and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) surveillance. Biological responses evaluated by cfEBV DNA were profiled and compared with conventional MRI-based RECIST evaluation. The inverse probability weighting (IPW)-adjusted survival analysis was performed for major survival endpoints. The Cox proportional hazard regression [CpH]-based model was developed to predict the on-treatment ctDNA-based individualized survival.Of 821 patients, 71.4% achieved complete biological response (cBR) upon NAC completion. RECIST-based response evaluations had 25.3% discordance with ctDNA-based evaluations. IPW-adjusted survival analysis revealed that cfEBV DNApost-NACwas a preferential prognosticator for all endpoints, especially for distant metastasis. In contrast, radiological response was more preferentially associated with locoregional recurrence. Intriguingly, cfEBV DNApost-NACfurther stratified RECIST-responsive and non-responsive patients; RECIST-based non-responsive patients with cBR still derived substantial clinical benefits. Moreover, detectable cfEBV DNApost-NAChad 83.6% prediction sensitivity for detectable post-treatment ctDNA, which conferred early determination of treatment benefits. Finally, we established individualized risk prediction models and demonstrated that introducing on-treatment ctDNA significantly refined risk stratification.Our study helps advance the implementation of ctDNA-based testing in therapeutic response evaluation for a refined risk stratification. The dynamic and refined risk profiling would tailor future liquid biopsy-based risk-adapted personalized therapy.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Among them, a variety of omics techniques have been utilized to analyze periodontitis pathology and progression. However, few accurate signature molecules are known and available. Herein, we aimed to screened and identified signature molecules suitable for distinguishing periodontitis patients using machine learning models by integrated analysis of TMT proteomics and transcriptomics with the purpose of finding novel prediction or diagnosis targets. Differential protein profiles, functional enrichment analysis, and protein-protein interaction network analysis were conducted based on TMT proteomics of 15 gingival tissues from healthy and periodontitis patients. DEPs correlating with periodontitis were screened using LASSO regression. We constructed a new diagnostic model using an artificial neural network (ANN) and verified its efficacy based on periodontitis transcriptomics datasets (GSE10334 and GSE16134). Western blotting validated expression levels of hub DEPs. TMT proteomics revealed 5658 proteins and 115 DEPs, and the 115 DEPs are closely related to inflammation and immune activity. Nine hub DEPs were screened by LASSO, and the ANN model distinguished healthy from periodontitis patients. The model showed satisfactory classification ability for both training (AUC=0.972) and validation (AUC=0.881) cohorts by ROC analysis. Expression levels of the 9 hub DEPs were validated and consistent with TMT proteomics quantitation. Our work reveals that nine hub DEPs in gingival tissues are closely related to the occurrence and progression of periodontitis and are potential signature molecules involved in periodontitis.Copyright © 2022 Liu, Qiu, Huang, Zhang, Wu, Deng, Chen, Guo, Wu, Chen and Fang."

This study aimed to analyze the epithelium mRNA profile in response to airborne particulate matter in the control, asthma, and COPD groups.A triple co-culture of nasal epithelium, monocyte-derived macrophages, and monocyte-derived dendritic cells obtained from the controls, asthma, and COPD were exposed to urban particulate matter (UPM) for 24 h. RNA-Seq analysis found differences in seven (CYP1B1, CYP1B1-AS1, NCF1, ME1, LINC02029, BPIFA2, EEF1A2), five (CYP1B1, ARC, ENPEP, RASD1, CYP1B1-AS1), and six (CYP1B1, CYP1B1-AS1, IRF4, ATP1B2, TIPARP, CCL22) differentially expressed genes between UPM exposed and unexposed triple co-cultured epithelium in the control, asthma, and COPD groups, respectively. PCR analysis showed that mRNA expression of BPIFA2 and ENPEP was upregulated in both asthma and COPD, while the expression of CYP1B1-AS1 and TIPARP was increased in the epithelium from COPD patients only. Biological processes changed in UPM exposed triple co-cultured epithelium were associated with epidermis development and epidermal cell differentiation in asthma and with response to toxic substances in COPD.The biochemical processes associated with pathophysiology of asthma and COPD impairs the airway epithelial response to UPM."

As the thymus plays a central role in shaping the T cell repertoire, we aimed to identify the most likely causal genetic factors behind this association using thymocyte genomic data. In four thymocyte populations, we identified 253 DNA sequence motifs underlying histone modifications. The G insertion allele of rs138300818, associated with protection from diabetes, created thymocyte motifs for multiple histone modifications and thymocyte types. In a parallel approach to identifying variants that alter transcription factor binding motifs, the same variant disrupted a predicted motif for Rfx7, which is abundantly expressed in the thymus. Chromatin state and RNA sequencing data suggested strong transcription overlapping rs138300818 in fetal thymus, while expression quantitative trait locus and chromatin conformation data associate the insertion with lower THEMIS expression. Extending the analysis to other T1D loci further highlighted rs66733041 affecting the GATA3 transcription factor binding in the AFF3 locus. Taken together, our results support a role for thymic THEMIS gene expression and the rs138300818 variant in promoting the development of early-onset T1D.© 2022. The Author(s)."

However, the compromised developmental potential of ROSI embryos largely limits the clinical application, and the mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we describe the transcriptome, chromatin accessibility, and DNA methylation landscapes of mouse ROSI embryos derived from early-stage round spermatids using a single-cell multiomics sequencing approach. By interrogating these data, we identify the reprogramming defects in ROSI embryos at the pronuclear stages, which are mainly associated with the misexpression of a cohort of minor zygotic genome activation genes. We screen a small compound, A366, that can significantly increase the developmental potential of ROSI embryos, in which A366 can partially overcome the reprogramming defects by amending the epigenetic and transcriptomic states. Collectively, our study uncovers the reprogramming defects in ROSI embryos for understanding the mechanisms underlying compromised developmental potential and offers an avenue for ROSI technique optimization."

Data were analyzed between November 2019 and February 2022.Conception by ART (mostly in vitro fertilization, intracytoplasmic sperm injection, and embryo transfer) vs natural conception (NC; without any medically assisted reproduction).The main outcomes were length / height, weight, and body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared). Each cohort was analyzed separately with adjustment for maternal BMI, age, smoking, education, parity, and ethnicity and offspring sex and age. Results were combined in random effects meta-analysis for 13 age groups.Up to 158 066 offspring (4329 conceived by ART) were included in each age-group meta-analysis, with between 47.6% to 60.6% females in each cohort. Compared with offspring who were NC, offspring conceived via ART were shorter, lighter, and thinner from infancy to early adolescence, with differences largest at the youngest ages and attenuating with older child age. For example, adjusted mean differences in offspring weight were -0.27 (95% CI, -0.39 to -0.16) SD units at age younger than 3 months, -0.16 (95% CI, -0.22 to -0.09) SD units at age 17 to 23 months, -0.07 (95% CI, -0.10 to -0.04) SD units at age 6 to 9 years, and -0.02 (95% CI, -0.15 to 0.12) SD units at age 14 to 17 years. Smaller offspring size was limited to individuals conceived by fresh but not frozen embryo transfer compared with those who were NC (eg, difference in weight at age 4 to 5 years was -0.14 [95% CI, -0.20 to -0.07] SD units for fresh embryo transfer vs NC and 0.00 [95% CI, -0.15 to 0.15] SD units for frozen embryo transfer vs NC). More marked differences were seen for body fat measurements, and there was imprecise evidence that offspring conceived by ART developed greater adiposity by early adulthood (eg, ART vs NC difference in fat mass index at age older than 17 years: 0.23 [95% CI, -0.04 to 0.50] SD units).These findings suggest that people conceiving or conceived by ART can be reassured that differences in early growth and adiposity are small and no longer evident by late adolescence."

The rhythms are endogenously driven by daily oscillatory activities of so-called ""clock genes/proteins"", which are widely distributed throughout the mammalian brain. Mammalian (mechanistic) target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling is a fundamental intracellular signal transduction cascade that controls important neuronal processes including neurodevelopment, synaptic plasticity, metabolism, and aging. Dysregulation of the mTOR pathway is associated with psychiatric disorders including autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and mood disorders (MD), in which patients often exhibit disrupted daily physiological rhythms and abnormal circadian gene expression in the brain. Recent work has found that the activities of mTOR signaling are temporally controlled by the circadian clock and exhibit robust circadian oscillations in multiple systems. In the meantime, mTOR signaling regulates fundamental properties of the central and peripheral circadian clocks, including period length, entrainment, and synchronization. Whereas the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated, increasing clinical and preclinical evidence support significant crosstalk between mTOR signaling, the circadian clock, and psychiatric disorders. Here, we review recent progress in understanding the trilateral interactions and propose an ""interaction triangle"" model between mTOR signaling, the circadian clock, and psychiatric disorders (focusing on ASD and MD).© 2022.

Therefore, this study focused on exploring the participation of lncRNAs in mitochondrial dysfunction and ferroptosis using public datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. We identified the mitochondrion- and ferroptosis-related lncRNAs by Pearson's analysis and lasso-Cox regression. Moreover, real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) was utilized to further confirm the abnormal expression of these lncRNAs. Based on eight lncRNAs, the MF-related lncRNA prognostic signature (LPS) with outstanding stratification ability and prognostic prediction capability was constructed. In addition, functional enrichment analysis and immune cell infiltration analysis were performed to explore the possible functions of lncRNAs and their impact on the tumor microenvironment. The pathways related to G2M checkpoint and MYC were activated, and the infiltration ratio of regulatory T cells and M0 and M2 macrophages was higher in the high-risk group. In conclusion, these lncRNAs may affect mitochondria functions, ferroptosis, and immune cell infiltration in HCC through specific pathways, which may provide valuable insight into the progression and therapies of HCC.Copyright © 2022 Xia, Zeng, Zheng, Huang, Zhou and Bai."

Thus, novel diagnostic biomarkers are required to improve clinical care. However, research on PCa immunotherapy is also scarce. Hence, the present study aimed to explore promising BCR-related diagnostic biomarkers, and their expression pattern, prognostic value, immune response effects, biological functions, and possible molecular mechanisms were evaluated. GEO datasets (GSE46602, GSE70768, and GSE116918) were downloaded and merged as the training cohort, and differential expression analysis was performed. Lasso regression and SVM-RFE algorithm, as well as PPI analysis and MCODE algorithm, were then applied to filter BCR-related biomarker genes. The CIBERSORT and estimation of stromal and immune cells in malignant tumor tissues using expression data (ESTIMATE) methods were used to calculate the fractions of tumor-infiltrating immune cells. GO/DO enrichment analyses were used to identify the biological functions. The expression of latent transforming growth factor β-binding protein 2 (LTBP2) was determined by RT-qPCR and western blotting. The role of LTBP2 in PCa was determined by CCK-8, Transwell, and the potential mechanism was investigated by KEGG and GSEA and confirmed by western blotting. In total, 44 BCR-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the training cohort were screened. LTBP2 was found to be a diagnostic biomarker of BCR in PCa and was associated with CD4+T-cell infiltration and response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy. Subsequently, using the ESTIMATE algorithm, it was identified that LTBP2 was associated with the tumor microenvironment and could be a predictor of the clinical benefit of immune checkpoint blockade. Finally, the expression and biological function of LTBP2 were evaluated via cellular experiments. The results showed that LTBP2 was downregulated in PCa cells and inhibited PCa proliferation and metastasis via the PI3K/AKT signaling pathwayin vitro. In conclusion, LTBP2 was a promising diagnostic biomarker of BCR of PCa and had an important role in CD4+T-cell recruitment. Moreover, it was associated with immunotherapy in patients with PCa who developed BCR, and it inhibited PCa proliferation and metastasis via the PI3K/AKT signaling pathwayin vitro.Copyright: © Zhang et al."

The goal of this study was to explore potential biological biomarkers for T1DM.Two microarray datasets (GSE55098 and GSE156035) about human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were systematically extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Common genes were identified from the perspective of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) respectively, and hub genes were identified by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analysis. We also observed the expression of these hub genes in some common autoimmune diseases and predicted transcription factors (TFs) that might be associated with these genes.Seven hub genes (DDIT4, ESCO2, SH3BP4, PRICKLE1, EPM2AIP1, KCNJ15 and GRM8) were finally identified. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that the high expression of these genes could well predict the occurrence of T1DM. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) suggested that most of these hub genes may be mainly involved in the changes of biological functions such as inflammation, infection, immunity, cancer, and apoptosis. Further, compared with the control group, the expression levels of these hub genes also changed in some other autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), etc., indicating that they might be the common targets of these autoimmune diseases.The present study identified novel genes associated with T1DM from the PBMCs perspective that might provide new ideas for the early diagnosis, monitoring, evaluation, and prediction of T1DM.© 2022.

We used univariate Cox, lasso, and multivariate Cox regression to identify the independent prognostic TDGs of BRCA. Then we constructed a prognostic signature and verified its predictive performance. Gene set enrichment analysis of the signal pathway revealed the differences between the prognostic signature high- and low-risk groups. Finally, a nomogram related to the prognostic model was established and verified.A total of 595 differentially expressed TDGs were identified, which are related to various molecular mechanisms of BRCA progression. We identified 8 independent prognostic TDGs for BRCA and validated their expression and prognosis with public data and clinical samples. The BRCA cohort was divided into training and validation cohorts, and prognostic signatures were constructed separately. The log-rank test showed that the survival rate of the high-risk group was significantly lower than that of the low-risk group in the prognostic signature (P<0.001); the AUC in the three cohorts were 0.805, 0.712, and 0.760, respectively; the nomogram also showed better predictive performance. Analyzing the difference between the two risk subtypes, the high-risk group is mainly enriched in angiogenesis, MTORC1, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and glycolysis, which means it is highly malignant.The prognostic signature and nomogram was confirmed to accurately predict the prognosis of patients with BRCA and we validated the hub genes, suggesting their potential as future therapeutic targets.AJTR Copyright © 2022."
"35958412","Identification of hub biomarkers of myocardial infarction by single-cell sequencing, bioinformatics, and machine learning.","Front Cardiovasc Med","Myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the first cardiovascular diseases endangering human health. Inflammatory response plays a significant role in the pathophysiological process of MI. Messenger RNA (mRNA) has been proven to play a key role in cardiovascular diseases. Single-cell sequencing (SCS) technology is a new technology for high-throughput sequencing analysis of genome, transcriptome, and epigenome at the single-cell level, and it also plays an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Machine learning algorithms have a wide scope of utilization in biomedicine and have demonstrated superior efficiency in clinical trials. However, few studies integrate these three methods to investigate the role of mRNA in MI. The aim of this study was to screen the expression of mRNA, investigate the function of mRNA, and provide an underlying scientific basis for the diagnosis of MI.In total, four RNA microarray datasets of MI, namely, GSE66360, GSE97320, GSE60993, and GSE48060, were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The function analysis was carried out by Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and Disease Ontology (DO) enrichment analysis. At the same time, inflammation-related genes (IRGs) were acquired from the GeneCards database. Then, 52 co-DEGs were acquired from differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in differential analysis, IRGs, and genes from SCS, and they were used to construct a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Two machine learning algorithms, namely, (1) least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and (2) support vector machine recursive feature elimination, were used to filter the co-DEGs. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to screen the hub-modulating signaling pathways associated with the hub genes. The results were validated in GSE97320, GSE60993, and GSE48060 datasets. The CIBERSORT algorithm was used to analyze 22 infiltrating immune cells in the MI and healthy control (CON) groups and to analyze the correlation between these immune cells. The Pymol software was used for molecular docking of hub DEGs and for potential treatment of MI drugs acquired from the COREMINE.A total of 126 DEGs were in the MI and CON groups. After screening two machine learning algorithms and key co-DEGs from a PPI network, two hub DEGs (i.e., IL1B and TLR2) were obtained. The diagnostic efficiency of IL1B, TLR2, and IL1B + TLR2 showed good discrimination in the four cohorts. GSEA showed that KEGG enriched by DEGs were mainly related to inflammation-mediated signaling pathways, and GO biological processes enriched by DEGs were linked to biological effects of various inflammatory cells. Immune analysis indicated that IL1B and TLR2 were correlated with various immune cells. Dan shen, san qi, feng mi, yuan can e, can sha, san qi ye, san qi hua, and cha shu gen were identified as the potential traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for the treatment of MI. 7-hydroxyflavone (HF) had stable combinations with IL1B and TLR2, respectively.This study identified two hub DEGs (IL1B and TLR2) and illustrated its potential role in the diagnosis of MI to enhance our knowledge of the underlying molecular mechanism. Infiltrating immune cells played an important role in MI. TCM, especially HF, was a potential drug for the treatment of MI.Copyright © 2022 Zhang, Guo, Zhang, Liu, Peng, Wang and Zhang."

However, heterogeneity with reference to mitophagy remains unexplored in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD).Materials and methods:We used Reactome database to download the mitophagy-related, glycolysis-related and cholesterol biosynthesis-related signaling pathways. Unsupervised clustering using the ""ConsensusClusterPlus"" R package was performed to identify molecular subtypes related to mitophagy and metabolism. Prognosis-related mitophagy regulators were identified by univariate Cox regression analysis. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival analyses were used to assess the diagnostic and prognostic role of the hub genes and prognosis risk model. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was utilized for screening the mitophagy subtype-related hub genes. Metascape was utilized to carry out functional enrichment analysis. The ""glmnet"" R package was utilised for LASSO, and the ""e1071"" R package was utilised for SVM. Chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity was estimated using the R package ""pRRophetic"" and Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database. The nomogram was established by the ""rms"" R package.Results:Three distinct mitophagy subtypes (low, high and intermediate) of PAAD were identified based on the landscape of mitophagy regulators. The high mitophagy subtype had the worst prognosis, highest mRNA expression-based stemness index scores and most hypoxic environment compared to the other subtypes. Additionally, glycolysis and cholesterol biosynthesis were significantly elevated. Three mitophagy subtype-specific gene signatures (CAST, CCDC6,andERLIN1) were extracted using WGCNA and machine learning. Moreover, PAAD tumours were insensitive to Erlotinib, Sunitinib and Imatinib in the high mitophagy subtype and highCAST, CCDC6,andERLIN1expressed subtypes. Furthermore,CAST, CCDC6,andERLIN1affected immune cell infiltration (M1 and CD8Tcm), resulting in the altered prognosis of patients with PAAD. A nomogram was constructed to screen patients with the low mitophagy subtype, which showed a higher sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents.Conclusion:Based on various bioinformatics tools and databases, the PAAD heterogeneity regarding mitophagy was systematically examined. Three different PAAD subtypes having different outcomes, metabolism patterns and chemosensitivity were observed. Moreover, three novel biomarkers that are closely associated with mitophagy and have the potential to guide individualised treatment regimens in PAAD were obtained.Copyright © 2022 Chen, Zhang, Sun, Wang and Qian."

Therefore, it is urgent to develop innovative strategies to ameliorate the outcome of CHD patients and explore novel biomarkers connected to the pathogenicity of CHD.The weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) was carried out on a coronary atherosclerosis dataset GSE90074 to determine the crucial modules and hub genes for their prospective relationship to CHD. After the different modules associated with CHD have been identified, the Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enriched pathway analyses were conducted. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was thereafter performed for the critical module using STRING and Cytoscape.The yellow module was recognized as the most critical module associated with CHD. The enriched pathways in the yellow module included those related to inflammatory response, positive regulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) cascade, lipid catabolic process, cellular response to oxidative stress, apoptotic pathway, and NF-kappa B pathway. Further CytoHubba analysis revealed the top five hub genes (MMP14,CD28,CaMK4,RGS1, andDDAH1) associated with CHD development.The current study provides the prognosis, novel hub genes, and signaling pathways for treating coronary atherosclerosis. However, their potential biological roles require deeper investigation.Copyright © 2022 Jinli Bao."

Glycemic control does not fully explain this excess CVD risk, so a greater understanding of other risk factors is needed.The authors review the relationship between glycemia and CVD risk in adults with type 1 diabetes and summarize evidence regarding other factors that may explain risk beyond glycemia. Insulin resistance, weight gain, sex differences, genetics, inflammation, emerging markers of risk, including lipid subclasses and epigenetic modifications, and future directions are discussed. As glycemic control improves, an increased focus on other CVD risk factors is warranted in type 1 diabetes. Novel markers and precision medicine approaches may improve CVD prediction, but a lack of type 1 diabetes-specific guidelines for lipids, blood pressure, and physical activity are likely impediments to optimal CVD prevention in this high-risk population.© 2022.

Typically examined in older adults, recent work shows frailty occurs in middle-aged individuals and is associated with increased mortality. Previous investigation of global transcriptome changes in a middle-aged cohort from the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) study demonstrated inflammatory genes and pathways were significantly altered by frailty status and race. Transcriptome differences in frailty by sex remain unclear. We sought to discover novel genes and pathways associated with sex and frailty in a diverse middle-aged cohort using RNA-Sequencing.Differential gene expression and pathway analyses were performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells for 1) frail females (FRAF, n = 4) vs non-frail females (NORF, n = 4), 2) frail males (FRAM, n = 4) vs non-frail males (NORM, n = 4), 3) FRAM vs FRAF, and 4) NORM vs NORF. We evaluated exclusive significant genes and pathways, as well as overlaps, between the comparison groups.Over 80% of the significant genes exclusive to FRAF vs NORF, FRAM vs NORM, and FRAM vs FRAF, respectively, were novel and associated with various biological functions. Pathways exclusive to FRAF vs NORF were associated with reduced inflammation, while FRAM vs NORM exclusive pathways were related to aberrant musculoskeletal physiology. Pathways exclusive to FRAM vs FRAF were associated with reduced cell cycle regulation and activated catabolism and Coronavirus pathogenesis.Our results indicate sex-specific transcriptional changes occur in middle-aged frailty, enhancing knowledge on frailty progression and potential therapeutic targets to prevent frailty.© 2022.

We initially demonstrated that P4HA3 was significantly upregulated in the subcutaneous adipose tissue of obesity and T2DM patients, and its functional roles in adipocyte differentiation and insulin resistance were investigated using in vitro and in vivo models. The knockdown of P4HA3 inhibited adipocyte differentiation and improved insulin resistance in 3T3-L1 cells. In C57BL/6J db/db mice fed with a high fat diet (HFD), silencing P4HA3 significantly decreased fasting blood glucose and triglycerides (TG) levels, with concomitant decrease of body weight and adipose tissue weight. Further analysis showed that P4HA3 knockdown was correlated with the augmented IRS-1/PI3K/Akt/FoxO1 signaling pathway in the adipose and hepatic tissues of obese mice, which could improve hepatic glucose homeostasis and steatosis of mice. Together, our study suggested that the dysregulation of P4HA3 may contribute to the development of obesity and T2DM."
"35959987","Alteration of RNA modification signature in human sperm correlates with sperm motility.","Mol Hum Reprod","RNA modifications, which are introduced post-transcriptionally, have recently been assigned pivotal roles in the regulation of spermatogenesis and embryonic development. However, the RNA modification landscape in human sperm is poorly characterized, hampering our understanding about the potential role played by RNA modification in sperm. Through our recently developed high-throughput RNA modification detection platform based on liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectroscopy, we are the first to have characterized the RNA modification signature in human sperm. The RNA modification signature was generated on the basis of 49 samples from participants, including 13 healthy controls, 21 patients with asthenozoospermia (AZS) and 15 patients with teratozoospermia (TZS). In total, we identified 13 types of RNA modification marks on the total RNA in sperm, and 16 types of RNA modification marks on sperm RNA fragments of different sizes. The levels of these RNA modifications on the RNA of patients with AZS or TZS were altered, compared to controls, especially on sperm RNA fragments > 80 nt. A few types of RNA modifications, such as m1G, m5C, m2G and m1A, showed clear co-expression patterns as well as high linear correlations with clinical sperm motility. In conclusion, we characterized the RNA modification signature of human sperm and identified its correlation with sperm motility, providing promising candidates for use in clinical sperm quality assessment and new research insights for exploring the underlying pathological mechanisms in human male infertility syndromes.© The Author(s) 2022.

Accumulating data support the contributions of the peripheral immune system in AD pathogenesis. However, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding about the molecular characteristics of peripheral immune cells in AD.To explore the alterations of cellular composition and the alterations of intrinsic expression of individual cell types in peripheral blood, we performed cellular deconvolution in a large-scale bulk blood expression cohort and identified cell-intrinsic differentially expressed genes in individual cell types with adjusting for cellular proportion.We detected a significant increase and decrease in the proportion of neutrophils and B lymphocytes in AD blood, respectively, which had a robust replicability across other three AD cohorts, as well as using alternative algorithms. The differentially expressed genes in AD neutrophils were enriched for some AD-associated pathways, such as ATP metabolic process and mitochondrion organization. We also found a significant enrichment of protein-protein interaction network modules of leukocyte cell-cell activation, mitochondrion organization, and cytokine-mediated signaling pathway in neutrophils for AD risk genes including CD33 and IL1B. Both changes in cellular composition and expression levels of specific genes were significantly associated with the clinical and pathological alterations. A similar pattern of perturbations on the cellular proportion and gene expression levels of neutrophils could be also observed in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Moreover, we noticed an elevation of neutrophil abundance in the AD brains.We revealed the landscape of molecular perturbations at the cellular level for AD. These alterations highlight the putative roles of neutrophils in AD pathobiology.© 2022. The Author(s)."

While laudable, these efforts typically neglect early-life exposures that influence long-term well-being. With a focus on the urban physical environment, we argue that longevity-ready cities can accomplish more than initiatives focused solely on old age. We review features of cities that cumulatively influence healthy aging and longevity, discuss the need for proactive interventions in a changing climate, and highlight inequities in the ambient physical environment, especially those encountered at early ages, that powerfully contribute to disparities in later life stages. Compared with strategies aimed largely at accommodating older populations, longevity-ready cities would aim to reduce the sources of disadvantages across the life course and simultaneously improve the well-being of older people."

Genetic factors strongly contribute to this continuity, but it is still poorly known how their contribution changes over childhood and adolescence. Thus, we used the genetic twin design to estimate the genetic correlations of BMI from infancy to adulthood and compared them to the genetic correlations of height.We pooled individual level data from 25 longitudinal twin cohorts including 38,530 complete twin pairs and having 283,766 longitudinal height and weight measures. The data were analyzed using Cholesky decomposition offering genetic and environmental correlations of BMI and height between all age combinations from 1 to 19 years of age.The genetic correlations of BMI and height were stronger than the trait correlations. For BMI, we found that genetic correlations decreased as the age between the assessments increased, a trend that was especially visible from early to middle childhood. In contrast, for height, the genetic correlations were strong between all ages. Age-to-age correlations between environmental factors shared by co-twins were found for BMI in early childhood but disappeared altogether by middle childhood. For height, shared environmental correlations persisted from infancy to adulthood.Our results suggest that the genes affecting BMI change over childhood and adolescence leading to decreasing age-to-age genetic correlations. This change is especially visible from early to middle childhood indicating that new genetic factors start to affect BMI in middle childhood. Identifying mediating pathways of these genetic factors can open possibilities for interventions, especially for those children with high genetic predisposition to adult obesity.© 2022.

TheMG828507mRNA level correlated with that of theFLT1in placentas from pre-eclamptic women as well as in samples from uncomplicated pregnancies. However, neither the overexpression nor knockdown ofMG828507affected the expression ofFLT1. Analysis of pre-eclampsia-linking genetic variants at this locus suggested that the placental genotype of one variant was associated with the expression ofMG828507. TheMG828507transcript level was not found to be associated with maternal blood pressure, but showed a relationship with birth and placental weights, suggesting that this lncRNA might be one of the pivotal placental factors in pre-eclampsia.Further characterization of theMG828507gene may elucidate the etiological roles of theMG828507andFLT1genes in pre-eclampsia in a genomic context."

The lack of treatments encouraged the discovery of human proteomes to find potential therapeutic targets. As one of the major components of the human proteome, plasma proteins are functionally connected with various organs of the body to regulate biological processes and mediate overall homeostasis, which makes it crucial in various complex processes such as aging and chronic diseases. By performing a systematic causal analysis of the plasma proteome, we attempt to reveal the etiological mechanism and discover drug targets for sarcopenia.Methods:By using data from four genome-wide association studies for blood proteins and the UK Biobank data for sarcopenia-related traits, we applied two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to evaluate 310 plasma proteins as possible causal mediators of sarcopenia-related traits: appendicular lean mass (ALM) and handgrip strength (right and left). Then we performed a two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization analysis for the identified putatively causal proteins to assess potential reverse causality that the trait values may influence protein levels. Finally, we performed phenome-wide MR analysis of the identified putatively causal proteins for 784 diseases to test the possible side effects of these proteins on other diseases.Results:Five plasma proteins were identified as putatively causal mediators of sarcopenia-related traits. Specifically, leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor subfamily B member 2 (LILRB2), asporin (ASPN), and contactin-2 (CNTN2) had potential causal effects on appendicular lean mass, and ecto-ADP-ribosyltransferase 4 (ART4) and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) had putative causal effects on the handgrip strength, respectively. None of the five putatively causal proteins had a reverse causality relationship with sarcopenia-related traits, and no side effects on other diseases were identified.Conclusion:We identified five plasma proteins that may serve as putatively potential novel drug targets for sarcopenia.

A key step in the clustering process is to compute distances between the cells under a specified distance measure. Although particular distance measures may successfully separate cells into biologically relevant clusters, they may fail to retain global structure of the data, such as relative similarity between the cell clusters. In this article, we modify a biologically motivated distance measure, SIDEseq, for use of aggregate comparisons of cell types in large single-cell assays, and demonstrate that, across simulated and real scRNA seq data, the distance matrix more consistently retains global cell type relationships than commonly used distance measures for scRNA seq clustering. We call the modified distance measure ""SIDEREF."" We explore spectral dimension reduction of the SIDEREF distance matrix as a means of noise filtering, similar to principal components analysis applied directly to expression data. We utilize a summary measure of relative cell type distances to better display the cell group relationships. SIDEREF visualizations more consistently reflect global structures in the data than other commonly considered distance measures. We utilize relative cell type distances and the SIDEREF distance measure to uncover compositional differences between annotated leukocyte cell groups in a compendium ofMus musculusscRNA seq assays comprising 12 tissues.

"35999196","Genome-wide association study of posttraumatic stress disorder among childhood cancer survivors: results from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study and the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort.","Transl Psychiatry","Genetic influence shapes who develops posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after traumatic events. However, the genetic variants identified for PTSD may in fact be associated with traumatic exposures (e.g., interpersonal violence), which appear heritable as well. Childhood cancer survivors (CCS) are at risk for PTSD, but genetic influences affecting cancer are unlikely to overlap with those affecting PTSD. This offers a unique opportunity to identify variants specific to PTSD risk. In a genome-wide association study (GWAS), 3984 5-year survivors of childhood cancer of European-ancestry from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) were evaluated for discovery and 1467 survivors from the St. Jude Lifetime (SJLIFE) cohort for replication. Childhood cancer-related PTSD symptoms were assessed using the Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale in CCSS. GWAS was performed in CCSS using logistic regression and lead markers were replicated/meta-analyzed using SJLIFE. Cross-associations of identified loci were examined between CCS and the general population. PTSD criteria were met for 671 participants in CCSS and 161 in SJLIFE. Locus 10q26.3 was significantly associated with PTSD (rs34713356, functionally mapped to ECHS1, P = 1.36 × 10-8, OR 1.57), and was replicated in SJLIFE (P = 0.047, OR 1.37). Variants in locus 6q24.3-q25.1 reached marginal significance (rs9390543, SASH1, P = 3.56 × 10-6, OR 0.75) in CCSS and significance when meta-analyzing with SJLIFE (P = 2.02 × 10-8, OR 0.75). Both loci were exclusively associated with PTSD in CCS rather than PTSD/stress-related disorders in general population (P-for-heterogeneity < 5 × 10-6).

Adiponectin is a novel cytokine within inflammatory and cardiometabolic pathways with evidence of involvement in PTSD.Objective:This prospective exploratory study in a sample of female rape survivors investigated the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) and posttraumatic stress symptom (PTSS) severity, and the interaction of these SNPs of interest with childhood trauma in modifying the association with PTSS severity.Method:The study involved 455 rape-exposed black South African women (mean age (SD), 25.3 years (±5.5)) recruited within 20 days of being raped. PTSS was assessed using the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS) and childhood trauma was assessed using a modified version of the Childhood Trauma Scale-Short Form Questionnaire. EightADIPOQSNPs (rs17300539, rs16861194, rs16861205, rs2241766, rs6444174, rs822395, rs1501299, rs1403697) were genotyped using KASP. Mixed linear regression models were used to test additive associations ofADIPOQSNPs and PTSS severity at baseline, 3 and 6 months following rape.Results:The mean DTS score post-sexual assault was high (71.3 ± 31.5), with a decrease in PTSS severity shown over time for all genotypes. rs6444174TT genotype was inversely associated with baseline PTSS in the unadjusted model (β = -13.6, 95% CI [-25.1; -2.1],p = .021). However, no genotype was shown to be significantly associated with change in PTSS severity over time and thereforeADIPOQSNP x childhood trauma interaction was not further investigated.Conclusion:None of theADIPOQSNPs selected for investigation in this population were shown to be associated with change in PTSS severity over a 6-month period and therefore their clinical utility as risk biomarkers for rape-related PTSD appears limited. These SNPs should be further investigated in possible gene-gene and gene-environment interactions.© 2022 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
"35986173","Understanding the comorbidity between posttraumatic stress severity and coronary artery disease using genome-wide information and electronic health records.","Mol Psychiatry","The association between coronary artery disease (CAD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) contributes to the high morbidity and mortality observed for these conditions. To understand the dynamics underlying PTSD-CAD comorbidity, we investigated large-scale genome-wide association (GWA) statistics from the Million Veteran Program (MVP), the UK Biobank (UKB), the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, and the CARDIoGRAMplusC4D Consortium. We observed a genetic correlation of CAD with PTSD case-control and quantitative outcomes, ranging from 0.18 to 0.32. To investigate possible cause-effect relationships underlying these genetic correlations, we performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, observing a significant bidirectional relationship between CAD and PTSD symptom severity. Genetically-determined PCL-17 (PTSD 17-item Checklist) total score was associated with increased CAD risk (odds ratio = 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 95% CI = 1.01-1.06). Conversely, CAD genetic liability was associated with reduced PCL-17 total score (beta = -0.42; 95% CI = -0.04 to -0.81). Because of these opposite-direction associations, we conducted a pleiotropic meta-analysis to investigate loci with concordant vs. discordant effects on PCL-17 and CAD, observing that concordant-effect loci were enriched for molecular pathways related to platelet amyloid precursor protein (beta = 1.53, p = 2.97 × 10-7) and astrocyte activation regulation (beta = 1.51, p = 2.48 × 10-6) while discordant-effect loci were enriched for biological processes related to lipid metabolism (e.g., triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particle clearance, beta = 2.32, p = 1.61 × 10-10). To follow up these results, we leveraged MVP and UKB electronic health records (EHR) to assess longitudinal changes in the association between CAD and posttraumatic stress severity. This EHR-based analysis highlighted that earlier CAD diagnosis is associated with increased PCL-total score later in life, while lower PCL total score was associated with increased risk of a later CAD diagnosis (Mann-Kendall trend test: MVP tau = 0.932, p < 2 × 10-16; UKB tau = 0.376, p = 0.005). In conclusion, both our genetically-informed analyses and our EHR-based follow-up investigation highlighted a bidirectional relationship between PTSD and CAD where multiple pleiotropic mechanisms are likely to be involved.© 2022.

Participants included MHS members born before 1970 who received a diagnosis of PTSD in 2000 to 2015. Patients with PTSD who had PD before their first diagnosis were excluded. Data analysis was performed from February to June 2022.Incident PTSD was denoted by at least 1 diagnosis (1) given by psychiatrists, psychologists, or neurologists; (2) hospital discharge diagnosis; or (3) registered as a chronic diagnosis (defined as such by the primary care physician). The index date was defined as first diagnosis for the patients with PTSD and for the corresponding patients without PTSD.PD incident cases up to 2019 were ascertained by idiopathic PD diagnosis (1) given by a neurologist, (2) extracted from a hospital discharge report, or (3) registered as a chronic diagnosis. Patients with PD-like syndromes documentation after the last mention of PD were excluded.Of 8342 eligible patients, 8336 (99.9%) were matched to nonexposed patients in a 1:1 ratio by birth year and sex; 4303 patients (51.6%) were male, and the mean (SD) age at index was 55.8 (13.2) years. Patients with PTSD had a 1.48-fold (95% CI, 1.10-1.99) excess risk for PD, compared with patients without PTSD. An elevated risk of PD (hazard ratio, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.16-3.28) was recorded among men receiving a diagnosis of PTSD at age 72 years or older.These findings suggest that elderly men who receive a diagnosis of PTSD are at an increased risk of PD. Further studies are needed to corroborate these findings and to further assess the association of stress with PD risk."

Massive data generated in biological sciences by rapid and deep gene sequencing and protein or other molecular structure determination, on the one hand, requires data analysis capabilities using machine learning that are distinctly different from classical statistical methods; on the other, these large datasets are enabling the adoption of novel data-intensive machine learning algorithms for the solution of biological problems that until recently had relied on mechanistic model-based approaches that are computationally expensive. This review provides a bird's eye view of the applications of machine learning in post-genomic biology. Attempt is also made to indicate as far as possible the areas of research that are poised to make further impacts in these areas, including the importance of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) in human health. Further contributions of machine learning are expected to transform medicine, public health, agricultural technology, as well as to provide invaluable gene-based guidance for the management of complex environments in this age of global warming."

It is characterized by a poorly understood intellectual disability (ID). We studied two mouse models of DS, one with an extra copy of theDyrk1Agene (189N3) and the other with an extra copy of the mouse Chr16 syntenic region (Dp(16)1Yey). RNA-seq analysis of the transcripts deregulated in the embryonic hippocampus revealed an enrichment in genes associated with chromatin for the 189N3 model, and synapses for the Dp(16)1Yey model. A large-scale yeast two-hybrid screen (82 different screens, including 72 HSA21 baits and 10 rebounds) of a human brain library containing at least 107independent fragments identified 1,949 novel protein-protein interactions. The direct interactors of HSA21 baits and rebounds were significantly enriched in ID-related genes (P-value < 2.29 × 10-8). Proximity ligation assays showed that some of the proteins encoded by HSA21 were located at the dendritic spine postsynaptic density, in a protein network at the dendritic spine postsynapse. We located HSA21 DYRK1A and DSCAM, mutations of which increase the risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) 20-fold, in this postsynaptic network. We found that an intracellular domain of DSCAM bound either DLGs, which are multimeric scaffolds comprising receptors, ion channels and associated signaling proteins, or DYRK1A. The DYRK1A-DSCAM interaction domain is conserved inDrosophilaand humans. The postsynaptic network was found to be enriched in proteins associated with ARC-related synaptic plasticity, ASD, and late-onset Alzheimer's disease. These results highlight links between DS and brain diseases with a complex genetic basis.© 2022 Viard et al."

We hypothesized that schizophrenia and bipolar disorder share molecular alterations at the mitochondrial and synaptic levels. Mitochondria DNA (mtDNA) copy number (CN), mtDNA common deletion (CD), mtDNA total deletion, complex I activity, synapse number, and synaptic mitochondria number were studied in the postmortem human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), superior temporal gyrus (STG), primary visual cortex (V1), and nucleus accumbens (NAc) of controls (CON), and subjects with schizophrenia (SZ), and bipolar disorder (BD). The results showed (i) the mtDNA CN is significantly higher in DLPFC of both SZ and BD, decreased in the STG of BD, and unaltered in V1 and NAc of both SZ and BD; (ii) the mtDNA CD is significantly higher in DLPFC of BD while unaltered in STG, V1, and NAc of both SZ and BD; (iii) The total deletion burden is significantly higher in DLPFC in both SZ and BD while unaltered in STG, V1, and NAc of SZ and BD; (iv) Complex I activity is significantly lower in DLPFC of both SZ and BD, which is driven by the presence of medications, with no alteration in STG, V1, and NAc. In addition, complex I protein concentration, by ELISA, was decreased across three cortical regions of SZ and BD subjects; (v) The number of synapses is decreased in DLPFC of both SZ and BD, while the synaptic mitochondria number was significantly lower in female SZ and female BD compared to female controls. Overall, these findings will pave the way to understand better the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder for therapeutic interventions.© 2022. The Author(s)."

However, the severity of HO formation varies substantially between individuals, from relatively isolated small bone islands through to extensive soft tissue replacement by bone giving rise to debilitating symptoms. The aim of this study was to identify novel candidate therapeutic molecular targets for severe HO. We conducted a genome-wide scan in men and women with HO of varying severity following hip replacement for osteoarthritis. HO severity was dichotomized as mild or severe, and association analysis was performed with adjustment for age and sex. We next confirmed expression of the gene encoded by the lead signal in human bone and in primary human mesenchymal stem cells. We then examined the effect of gene knockout in a murine model of osseous trans-differentiation, and finally we explored transcription factor phosphorylation in key pathways perturbed by the gene. Ten independent signals were suggestively associated with HO severity, withKIF26Bas the lead. We subsequently confirmedKIF26Bexpression in human bone and upregulation upon BMP2-induced osteogenic differentiation in primary human mesenchymal stem cells, and also in a rat tendo-Achilles model of post-traumatic HO. CRISPR-Cas9 mediated knockout ofKif26binhibited BMP2-inducedRunx2,Sp7/Osterix,Col1A1,Alp, andBglap/Osteocalcinexpression and mineralized nodule formation in a murine myocyte model of osteogenic trans-differentiation. Finally, KIF26B deficiency inhibited ERK MAP kinase activation during osteogenesis, whilst augmenting p38 and SMAD 1/5/8 phosphorylation. Taken together, these data suggest a role for KIF26B in modulating the severity of post-traumatic HO and provide a potential novel avenue for therapeutic translation."

However, the broad application of endoscopy has been limited due to the invasive procedure and patient noncompliance. Liquid biopsy with subsequent mapping of methylation in specific cell-free DNA (cfDNA) may represent an alternative approach for early diagnosis. In this study, we have developed a minimal-invasive blood-based test for detection of precancerous lesions and early-stage CRC. Using TCGA M450K methylation data, we identified candidate methylation sites with the highest Fold Change (FC) for three genes (SEPTIN9, SDC2 and VIM), which were selected from previous studies. Based on logistic regression models, we developed a 3-gene methylation signature for CRC diagnosis with high accuracy (Sensitivity =0.959, Specificity =1, AUC =0.997). Using independent public databases and data from blood samples, this model has demonstrated superior performance. The AUC was 0.919-1 and 0.905-0.916 in public tissue database for CRC and blood sample data, respectively. Thus, our proposed 3-gene methylation signature has a more reliable performance than other methods. Furthermore, signal enhancement effect of 3-gene methylation signature can improve the accuracy of early diagnosis for CRC, which demonstrates the potential for clinical application.AJCR Copyright © 2022."

The results obtained from blood alone cannot fully reflect the alterations of nerve cells, including neurons and glia cells, in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate novel potential AD biomarker candidates, through an integrated multi-omics approach in AD. We propose a comprehensive strategy to identify high-confidence candidate biomarkers by integrating multi-omics data from AD, including single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) datasets of the prefrontal and entorhinal cortices, as wells as serum proteomic datasets. We first quantified a total of 124,658 nuclei, 8 cell types, and 3701 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from snRNA-seq dataset of 30 human cortices, as well as 1291 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) from serum proteomic dataset of 11 individuals. Then, ten DEGs/DEPs (NEBL, CHSY3, STMN2, MARCKS, VIM, FGD4, EPB41L2, PLEKHG1, PTPRZ1, and PPP1R14A) were identified by integration analysis of snRNA-seq and proteomics data. Finally, four novel candidate biomarkers (NEBL, EPB41L2, FGD4, and MARCKS) for AD further stood out, according to bioinformatics analysis, and they were verified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) verification. These candidate biomarkers are related to the regulation process of the actin cytoskeleton, which is involved in the regulation of synaptic loss in the AD brain tissue. Collectively, this study identified novel cell type-related biomarkers for AD by integrating multi-omics datasets from brains and serum. Our findings provided new targets for the clinical treatment and prognosis of AD."
"35974013","Primary cilia and SHH signaling impairments in human and mouse models of Parkinson's disease.","Nat Commun","Parkinson's disease (PD) as a progressive neurodegenerative disorder arises from multiple genetic and environmental factors. However, underlying pathological mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using multiplexed single-cell transcriptomics, we analyze human neural precursor cells (hNPCs) from sporadic PD (sPD) patients. Alterations in gene expression appear in pathways related to primary cilia (PC). Accordingly, in these hiPSC-derived hNPCs and neurons, we observe a shortening of PC. Additionally, we detect a shortening of PC in PINK1-deficient human cellular and mouse models of familial PD. Furthermore, in sPD models, the shortening of PC is accompanied by increased Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signal transduction. Inhibition of this pathway rescues the alterations in PC morphology and mitochondrial dysfunction. Thus, increased SHH activity due to ciliary dysfunction may be required for the development of pathoetiological phenotypes observed in sPD like mitochondrial dysfunction. Inhibiting overactive SHH signaling may be a potential neuroprotective therapy for sPD.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Several enzymes, such as DNA helicases and DNA polymerases, are involved in maintaining genomic integrity by unwinding and synthesizing the genome, respectively. Indeed, several human diseases that arise caused by deficiencies in these enzymes have long been known. In this review, the author presents the DNA helicases associated with human diseases discovered to date using recent analyses, including exome sequences. Since several mouse models that reflect these human diseases have been developed and reported, this study also summarizes the current knowledge regarding the outcomes of DNA helicase deficiencies in humans and mice and discusses possible mechanisms by which DNA helicases maintain genomic integrity in mammals. It also highlights specific diseases that demonstrate mammalian resilience, in which, despite the presence of genomic instability, patients and mouse models have lifespans comparable to those of the general population if they do not develop cancers; finally, this study discusses future directions for therapeutic applications in humans that can be explored using these mouse models.Copyright © 2022 Kohzaki."

A recent study has identified that the inflammatory aging clock was an excellent indicator to track multiple diseases. However, the role of the inflammatory aging clock in glioblastoma (GBM) remains to be explored. This study aimed to investigate the expression patterns and the prognostic values of inflammatory aging (iAge) in GBM, and its relations with stem cells.Methods:Inflammation-related genes (IRG) and their relations with chronological age in normal samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were identified by the Spearman correlation analysis. Then, we calculated the iAge and computed their correlations with chronological age in 168 patients with GBM. Next, iAge was applied to classify the patients into high- and low-iAge subtypes. Next, the survival analysis was performed. In addition, the correlations between iAge and stem cell indexes were evaluated. Finally, the results were validated in an external cohort.Results:Thirty-eight IRG were significantly associated with chronological age (|coefficient| > 0.5), and were used to calculate the iAge. Correlation analysis showed that iAge was positively correlated with chronological age. Enrichment analysis demonstrated that iAge was highly associated with immune cells and inflammatory activities. Survival analysis showed the patients in the low-iAge subtype had significantly better overall survival (OS) than those in the high-iAge subtype (p< 0.001). In addition, iAge outperformed the chronological age in revealing the correlations with stem cell stemness. External validation demonstrated that iAge was an excellent method to classify cancer subtypes and predict survival in patients with GBM.Conclusions:Inflammatory aging clock may be involved in the GBMviapotential influences on immune-related activities. iAge could be used as biomarkers for predicting the OS and monitoring the stem cell.Copyright © 2022 Zhu, Wang, Huang, Wang, Wang, Jiang and Li."
"35992772","Current strategies with implementation of three-dimensional cell culture: the challenge of quantification.","Interface Focus","From growing cells in spheroids to arranging them on complex engineered scaffolds, three-dimensional cell culture protocols are rapidly expanding and diversifying. While these systems may often improve the physiological relevance of cell culture models, they come with technical challenges, as many of the analytical methods used to characterize traditional two-dimensional (2D) cells must be modified or replaced to be effective. Here we review the advantages and limitations of quantification methods based either on biochemical measurements or microscopy imaging. We focus on the most basic of parameters that one may want to measure, the number of cells. Precise determination of this number is essential for many analytical techniques where measured quantities are only meaningful when normalized to the number of cells (e.g. cytochrome p450 enzyme activity). Thus, accurate measurement of cell number is often a prerequisite to allowing comparisons across different conditions (culturing conditions or drug and treatment screening) or between cells in different spatial states. We note that this issue is often neglected in the literature with little or no information given regarding how normalization was performed, we highlight the pitfalls and complications of quantification and call for more accurate reporting to improve reproducibility.© 2022 The Authors."

Up to now, scientists have relied on results achieved in animal research before proceeding to clinical trials. However, the high failure rate of targeted drugs in early phase trials leaves no doubt about the inadequacy of those models. In compliance with the need of reducing, and possibly replacing, animal research, studies have been conducted in vitro with advanced cellular models that more and more mimic the tumor in vivo. We will here review those methods that allow for the 3D reconstitution of the tumor and its microenvironment and the implementation of the organ-on-a-chip technology to study minimal organ units in disease progression. We will make specific reference to the usability of these systems as predictive cancer models and report on recent applications in high-throughput screenings of innovative and targeted drug compounds."

In this study, tumor tissue and the adjacent non-tumor liver were obtained at the time of surgery. The tissue was dissociated and grown as organoids. We developed 21 patient-derived organoid lines: 12 from metastases, three from the liver tumor and six from adjacent non-tumor liver. These patient-derived FLC organoids recapitulate the histologic morphology, immunohistochemistry, and transcriptome of the patient tumor. Patient-derived FLC organoids were used in a preliminary high-throughput drug screen to show proof of concept for the identification of therapeutics.

For example, in Ewing sarcoma, hundreds of inert GGAA repeats can be converted into active enhancers when bound by EWS-FLI1. Here we show that fusions between EWS and GGAA-repeat-targeted engineered zinc finger arrays (ZFAs) can function at least as efficiently as EWS-FLI1 for converting hundreds of GGAA repeats into active enhancers in a Ewing sarcoma precursor cell model. Furthermore, a fusion of a KRAB domain to a ZFA can silence GGAA microsatellite enhancers genome wide in Ewing sarcoma cells, thereby reducing expression of EWS-FLI1-activated genes. Remarkably, this KRAB-ZFA fusion showed selective toxicity against Ewing sarcoma cells compared with non-Ewing cancer cells, consistent with its Ewing sarcoma-specific impact on the transcriptome. These findings demonstrate the value of ZFAs for functional annotation of repeats and illustrate how aberrant microsatellite activities might be regulated for potential therapeutic applications."

Bioinformatic databases were queried to characteriseACBD3expression and mutation in breast cancer and to investigate how overexpression affects breast cancer patient outcomes. Immunohistochemistry was carried out to examine ACBD3 location within cells and tissue structures.ACBD3was more highly expressed in breast cancer than in any other cancer or matched normal tissue, and expression over the median level resulted in reduced relapse-free, overall, and distant metastasis-free survival for breast cancer patients as a whole, with some differences observed between subtypes. IHC analysis found that ACBD3 levels varied based on hormone receptor status, indicating that ACBD3 could be a candidate biomarker for poor patient prognosis in breast cancer and may possibly be a biomarker for ER signal reprogramming of precancerous breast tissue."

The genome of MCF7-DR cells was spatially reorganized into smaller topologically associating domains (TADs) and chromatin loops. We also revealed the contribution of increased chromatin accessibility and potential transcription factor families, including CTCF, AP-1 and bHLH, to gained TADs or loops. Intriguingly, we observed two condensed genomic regions (∼20 kb) with decreased chromatin accessibility flanking TAD boundaries, which might play a critical role in the formation or maintenance of TADs. Finally, combining data from TCGA, we identified a number of gained and lost enhancer-promoter interactions and their corresponding differentially expressed genes involved in chromatin organization and breast cancer signaling pathways, includingFA2H, FOXA1andJRKL, which might serve as potential treatment targets for breast cancer.Conclusion:These data uncovered a close connection between 3D genome reorganization, chromatin accessibility as well as gene transcription and provide novel insights into the epigenomic mechanisms involving doxorubicin resistance in breast cancer.Copyright © 2022 Wang, Yan, Ye, Zhang, Wang, Hao, Shen and Wei."

However, treatments that stabilize neurons and prevent their destruction are still lacking. Here, we identify the histone methyltransferase G9a as a druggable epigenetic regulator of neuronal vulnerability to inflammation. In murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and human multiple sclerosis (MS), we found that the G9a-catalyzed repressive epigenetic mark H3K9me2 was robustly induced by neuroinflammation. G9a activity repressed anti-ferroptotic genes, diminished intracellular glutathione levels, and triggered the iron-dependent programmed cell death pathway ferroptosis. Conversely, pharmacological treatment of EAE mice with a G9a inhibitor restored anti-ferroptotic gene expression, reduced inflammation-induced neuronal loss, and improved clinical outcome. Similarly, neuronal anti-ferroptotic gene expression was reduced in MS brain tissue and was boosted by G9a inhibition in human neuronal cultures. This study identifies G9a as a critical transcriptional enhancer of neuronal ferroptosis and potential therapeutic target to counteract inflammation-induced neurodegeneration."

The molecular mechanisms underlying astrocyte activation remain incompletely understood. Recent studies have suggested that classical neurotransmitter receptors are implicated in the modulation of brain innate immunity. We investigated the role of dopamine signaling in the process of astrocyte activation. Here, we show the upregulation of dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) in reactive astrocytes in MS brain and noncanonical role of astrocytic DRD2 in MS pathogenesis. Mice deficient in astrocytic Drd2 exhibit a remarkable suppression of reactive astrocytes and amelioration of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Mechanistically, DRD2 regulates the expression of 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase, which modulates NF-κB activity through protein kinase C-δ. Pharmacological blockade of astrocytic DRD2 with a DRD2 antagonist dehydrocorybulbine remarkably inhibits the inflammatory response in mice lacking neuronal Drd2. Together, our findings reveal previously an uncharted role for DRD2 in astrocyte activation during EAE-associated CNS inflammation.

The discrepancy between an individual's biological and chronological age of the brain (""brain age gap"") can be assessed by applying machine learning techniques to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data. Here, we examined the links between brain age gap and a broad range of cognitive, affective, socioeconomic, lifestyle, and physical health variables in up to 335 adults of the Berlin Aging Study II. Brain age gap was assessed using a validated prediction model that we previously trained on MRI scans of 32,634 UK Biobank individuals. Our statistical analyses revealed overall stronger evidence for a link between higher brain age gap and less favorable health characteristics than expected under the null hypothesis of no effect, with 80% of the tested associations showing hypothesis-consistent effect directions and 23% reaching nominal significance. The most compelling support was observed for a cluster covering both cognitive performance variables (episodic memory, working memory, fluid intelligence, digit symbol substitution test) and socioeconomic variables (years of education and household income). Furthermore, we observed higher brain age gap to be associated with heavy episodic drinking, higher blood pressure, and higher blood glucose. In sum, our results point toward multifaceted links between brain age gap and human health. Understanding differences in biological brain aging may therefore have broad implications for future informed interventions to preserve mental and physical health in old age.Copyright © 2022 Jawinski, Markett, Drewelies, Düzel, Demuth, Steinhagen-Thiessen, Wagner, Gerstorf, Lindenberger, Gaser and Kühn."
"36003909","Gender dimension in cardio-pulmonary continuum.","Front Cardiovasc Med","Cardio-pulmonary diseases, which were once regarded as a man's illness, have been one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality for both men and women in many countries in recent years. Both gender and sex influence the functional and structural changes in the human body and therefore play an important role in disease clinical manifestation, treatment choice, and/or response to treatment and prognosis of health outcomes. The gender dimension integrates sex and gender analysis in health sciences and medical research, however, it is still relatively overlooked suggesting the need for empowerment in the medical research community. Latest advances in the field of cardiovascular research have provided supportive evidence that the application of biological variables of sex has led to the understanding that heart disease in females may have different pathophysiology compared to males, particularly in younger adults. It has also resulted in new diagnostic techniques and a better understanding of symptomatology, while gender analysis has informed more appropriate risk stratification and prevention strategies. The existing knowledge in the pulmonary field shows the higher prevalence of pulmonary disorders among females, however, the role of gender as a socio-cultural construct has yet to be explored for the implementation of targeted interventions. The purpose of this review is to introduce the concept of gender dimension and its importance for the cardiopulmonary continuum with a focus on shared pathophysiology and disease presentation in addition to interrelation with chronic kidney disease. The review presents basic knowledge of what gender dimension means, and the application of sex and gender aspects in cardiovascular medicine with a specific focus on early pulmonary development, pulmonary hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Early vascular aging and inflammation have been presented as a potential pathophysiological link, with further interactions between the cardiopulmonary continuum and chronic kidney disease. Finally, implications for potential future research have been provided to increase the impact of gender dimension on research excellence that would add value to everybody, foster toward precision medicine and ultimately improve human health.Copyright © 2022 Hernandez, Laucyte-Cibulskiene, Ward, Kautzky-Willer, Herrero, Norris, Raparelli, Pilote, Stenvinkel, Kublickiene and the GOING-FWD Consortium."

Given the success of single-cell technologies a variety of computational tools and software packages were developed to enable and facilitate the analysis of scRNA-seq data. In this book chapter we want to give guidance on analyzing droplet-based scRNA-seq data from Drosophila. We will initially describe the preprocessing commonly done for Drosophila, point out possible downstream analyses, and finally highlight computational methods developed using Drosophila scRNA-seq data.© 2022.

"35974106","A new gene set identifies senescent cells and predicts senescence-associated pathways across tissues.","Nat Commun","Although cellular senescence drives multiple age-related co-morbidities through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype, in vivo senescent cell identification remains challenging. Here, we generate a gene set (SenMayo) and validate its enrichment in bone biopsies from two aged human cohorts. We further demonstrate reductions in SenMayo in bone following genetic clearance of senescent cells in mice and in adipose tissue from humans following pharmacological senescent cell clearance. We next use SenMayo to identify senescent hematopoietic or mesenchymal cells at the single cell level from human and murine bone marrow/bone scRNA-seq data. Thus, SenMayo identifies senescent cells across tissues and species with high fidelity. Using this senescence panel, we are able to characterize senescent cells at the single cell level and identify key intercellular signaling pathways. SenMayo also represents a potentially clinically applicable panel for monitoring senescent cell burden with aging and other conditions as well as in studies of senolytic drugs.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35963997","Metacells untangle large and complex single-cell transcriptome networks.","BMC Bioinformatics","Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies offer unique opportunities for exploring heterogeneous cell populations. However, in-depth single-cell transcriptomic characterization of complex tissues often requires profiling tens to hundreds of thousands of cells. Such large numbers of cells represent an important hurdle for downstream analyses, interpretation and visualization.We develop a framework called SuperCell to merge highly similar cells into metacells and perform standard scRNA-seq data analyses at the metacell level. Our systematic benchmarking demonstrates that metacells not only preserve but often improve the results of downstream analyses including visualization, clustering, differential expression, cell type annotation, gene correlation, imputation, RNA velocity and data integration. By capitalizing on the redundancy inherent to scRNA-seq data, metacells significantly facilitate and accelerate the construction and interpretation of single-cell atlases, as demonstrated by the integration of 1.46 million cells from COVID-19 patients in less than two hours on a standard desktop.SuperCell is a framework to build and analyze metacells in a way that efficiently preserves the results of scRNA-seq data analyses while significantly accelerating and facilitating them.© 2022.

"35951662","Scelestial: Fast and accurate single-cell lineage tree inference based on a Steiner tree approximation algorithm.","PLoS Comput Biol","Single-cell genome sequencing provides a highly granular view of biological systems but is affected by high error rates, allelic amplification bias, and uneven genome coverage. This creates a need for data-specific computational methods, for purposes such as for cell lineage tree inference. The objective of cell lineage tree reconstruction is to infer the evolutionary process that generated a set of observed cell genomes. Lineage trees may enable a better understanding of tumor formation and growth, as well as of organ development for healthy body cells. We describe a method, Scelestial, for lineage tree reconstruction from single-cell data, which is based on an approximation algorithm for the Steiner tree problem and is a generalization of the neighbor-joining method. We adapt the algorithm to efficiently select a limited subset of potential sequences as internal nodes, in the presence of missing values, and to minimize cost by lineage tree-based missing value imputation. In a comparison against seven state-of-the-art single-cell lineage tree reconstruction algorithms-BitPhylogeny, OncoNEM, SCITE, SiFit, SASC, SCIPhI, and SiCloneFit-on simulated and real single-cell tumor samples, Scelestial performed best at reconstructing trees in terms of accuracy and run time. Scelestial has been implemented in C++. It is also available as an R package named RScelestial."
"35944930","Resolution of the curse of dimensionality in single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis.","Life Sci Alliance","Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) can determine gene expression in numerous individual cells simultaneously, promoting progress in the biomedical sciences. However, scRNA-seq data are high-dimensional with substantial technical noise, including dropouts. During analysis of scRNA-seq data, such noise engenders a statistical problem known as the curse of dimensionality (COD). Based on high-dimensional statistics, we herein formulate a noise reduction method, RECODE (resolution of the curse of dimensionality), for high-dimensional data with random sampling noise. We show that RECODE consistently resolves COD in relevant scRNA-seq data with unique molecular identifiers. RECODE does not involve dimension reduction and recovers expression values for all genes, including lowly expressed genes, realizing precise delineation of cell fate transitions and identification of rare cells with all gene information. Compared with representative imputation methods, RECODE employs different principles and exhibits superior overall performance in cell-clustering, expression value recovery, and single-cell-level analysis. The RECODE algorithm is parameter-free, data-driven, deterministic, and high-speed, and its applicability can be predicted based on the variance normalization performance. We propose RECODE as a powerful strategy for preprocessing noisy high-dimensional data.© 2022 Imoto et al."
"35733333","Accounting for Errors in Data Improves Divergence Time Estimates in Single-cell Cancer Evolution.","Mol Biol Evol","Single-cell sequencing provides a new way to explore the evolutionary history of cells. Compared to traditional bulk sequencing, where a population of heterogeneous cells is pooled to form a single observation, single-cell sequencing isolates and amplifies genetic material from individual cells, thereby preserving the information about the origin of the sequences. However, single-cell data are more error-prone than bulk sequencing data due to the limited genomic material available per cell. Here, we present error and mutation models for evolutionary inference of single-cell data within a mature and extensible Bayesian framework, BEAST2. Our framework enables integration with biologically informative models such as relaxed molecular clocks and population dynamic models. Our simulations show that modeling errors increase the accuracy of relative divergence times and substitution parameters. We reconstruct the phylogenetic history of a colorectal cancer patient and a healthy patient from single-cell DNA sequencing data. We find that the estimated times of terminal splitting events are shifted forward in time compared to models which ignore errors. We observed that not accounting for errors can overestimate the phylogenetic diversity in single-cell DNA sequencing data. We estimate that 30-50% of the apparent diversity can be attributed to error. Our work enables a full Bayesian approach capable of accounting for errors in the data within the integrative Bayesian software framework BEAST2.© The Author(s) 2022.

"35972065","CellRegMap: a statistical framework for mapping context-specific regulatory variants using scRNA-seq.","Mol Syst Biol","Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables characterizing the cellular heterogeneity in human tissues. Recent technological advances have enabled the first population-scale scRNA-seq studies in hundreds of individuals, allowing to assay genetic effects with single-cell resolution. However, existing strategies to analyze these data remain based on principles established for the genetic analysis of bulk RNA-seq. In particular, current methods depend on a priori definitions of discrete cell types, and hence cannot assess allelic effects across subtle cell types and cell states. To address this, we propose the Cell Regulatory Map (CellRegMap), a statistical framework to test for and quantify genetic effects on gene expression in individual cells. CellRegMap provides a principled approach to identify and characterize genotype-context interactions of known eQTL variants using scRNA-seq data. This model-based approach resolves allelic effects across cellular contexts of different granularity, including genetic effects specific to cell subtypes and continuous cell transitions. We validate CellRegMap using simulated data and apply it to previously identified eQTL from two recent studies of differentiating iPSCs, where we uncover hundreds of eQTL displaying heterogeneity of genetic effects across cellular contexts. Finally, we identify fine-grained genetic regulation in neuronal subtypes for eQTL that are colocalized with human disease variants.© 2022 The Authors.

"36035173","Advances in molecular characterization of myeloid proliferations associated with Down syndrome.","Front Genet","Myeloid leukemia associated with Down syndrome (ML-DS) has a unique molecular landscape that differs from other subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia. ML-DS is often preceded by a myeloproliferative neoplastic condition called transient abnormal myelopoiesis (TAM) that disrupts megakaryocytic and erythroid differentiation. Over the last two decades, many genetic and epigenetic changes in TAM and ML-DS have been elucidated. These include overexpression of molecules and micro-RNAs located on chromosome 21,GATA1mutations, and a range of other somatic mutations and chromosomal alterations. In this review, we summarize molecular changes reported in TAM and ML-DS and provide a comprehensive discussion of these findings. Recent advances in the development of CRISPR/Cas9-modified induced pluripotent stem cell-based disease models are also highlighted. However, despite significant progress in this area, we still do not fully understand the pathogenesis of ML-DS, and there are no targeted therapies. Initial diagnosis of ML-DS has a favorable prognosis, but refractory and relapsed disease can be difficult to treat; therapeutic options are limited in Down syndrome children by their stronger sensitivity to the toxic effects of chemotherapy. Because of the rarity of TAM and ML-DS, large-scale multi-center studies would be helpful to advance molecular characterization of these diseases at different stages of development and progression.Copyright © 2022 Li and Kalev-Zylinska."
"35904805","The HDAC7-TET2 epigenetic axis is essential during early B lymphocyte development.","Nucleic Acids Res","Correct B cell identity at each stage of cellular differentiation during B lymphocyte development is critically dependent on a tightly controlled epigenomic landscape. We previously identified HDAC7 as an essential regulator of early B cell development and its absence leads to a drastic block at the pro-B to pre-B cell transition. More recently, we demonstrated that HDAC7 loss in pro-B-ALL in infants associates with a worse prognosis. Here we delineate the molecular mechanisms by which HDAC7 modulates early B cell development. We find that HDAC7 deficiency drives global chromatin de-condensation, histone marks deposition and deregulates other epigenetic regulators and mobile elements. Specifically, the absence of HDAC7 induces TET2 expression, which promotes DNA 5-hydroxymethylation and chromatin de-condensation. HDAC7 deficiency also results in the aberrant expression of microRNAs and LINE-1 transposable elements. These findings shed light on the mechanisms by which HDAC7 loss or misregulation may lead to B cell-based hematological malignancies.© The Author(s) 2022.

"36010665","How Azanucleosides Affect Myeloid Cell Fate.","Cells","The azanucleosides decitabine and azacytidine are used widely in the treatment of myeloid neoplasia and increasingly in the context of combination therapies. Although they were long regarded as being largely interchangeable in their function as hypomethylating agents, the azanucleosides actually have different mechanisms of action; decitabine interferes primarily with the methylation of DNA and azacytidine with that of RNA. Here, we examine the role of DNA methylation in the lineage commitment of stem cells during normal hematopoiesis and consider how mutations in epigenetic regulators such asDNMT3AandTET2can lead to clonal expansion and subsequent neoplastic progression. We also consider why the efficacy of azanucleoside treatment is not limited to neoplasias carrying mutations in epigenetic regulators. Finally, we summarise recent data describing a role for azacytidine-sensitive RNA methylation in lineage commitment and in the cellular response to stress. By summarising and interpreting evidence for azanucleoside involvement in a range of cellular processes, our review is intended to illustrate the need to consider multiple modes of action in the design and stratification of future combination therapies."

Here we captured smartphone touchscreen interactions from a healthy population (N = 684, ∼309 million interactions) spanning 16 to 86 years of age and trained a decision tree regression model to estimate chronological age based on the interactions. The interactions were clustered according to their next interval dynamics to quantify diverse smartphone behaviors. The regression model well-estimated the chronological age in health (mean absolute error = 6 years, R2 = 0.8). We next deployed this model on a population of stroke survivors (N = 41) to find larger prediction errors such that the estimated age was advanced by 6 years. A similar pattern was observed in people with epilepsy (N = 51), with prediction errors advanced by 10 years. The smartphone behavioral model trained in health can be used to study altered aging in neurological diseases.© 2022 The Author(s)."
"35899848","Comparing personalized brain-based and genetic risk scores for major depressive disorder in large population samples of adults and adolescents.","Eur Psychiatry","Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a polygenic disorder associated with brain alterations but until recently, there have been no brain-based metrics to quantify individual-level variation in brain morphology. Here, we evaluated and compared the performance of a new brain-based 'Regional Vulnerability Index' (RVI) with polygenic risk scores (PRS), in the context of MDD. We assessed associations with syndromal MDD in an adult sample (N = 702, age = 59 ± 10) and with subclinical depressive symptoms in a longitudinal adolescent sample (baselineN = 3,825, age = 10 ± 1; 2-year follow-upN = 2,081, age = 12 ± 1).MDD-RVIs quantify the correlation of the individual's corresponding brain metric with the expected pattern for MDD derived in an independent sample. Using the same methodology across samples, subject-specific MDD-PRS and six MDD-RVIs based on different brain modalities (subcortical volume, cortical thickness, cortical surface area, mean diffusivity, fractional anisotropy, and multimodal) were computed.In adults, MDD-RVIs (based on white matter and multimodal measures) were more strongly associated with MDD (β = 0.099-0.281, PFDR = 0.001-0.043) than MDD-PRS (β = 0.056-0.152, PFDR = 0.140-0.140). In adolescents, depressive symptoms were associated with MDD-PRS at baseline and follow-up (β = 0.084-0.086,p = 1.38 × 10-4-4.77 × 10-4) but not with any MDD-RVIs (β < 0.05,p > 0.05).Our results potentially indicate the ability of brain-based risk scores to capture a broader range of risk exposures than genetic risk scores in adults and are also useful in helping us to understand the temporal origins of depression-related brain features. Longitudinal data, specific to the developmental period and on white matter measures, will be useful in informing risk for subsequent psychiatric illness."
"35947618","The neuropeptide landscape of human prefrontal cortex.","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","Human prefrontal cortex (hPFC) is a complex brain region involved in cognitive and emotional processes and several psychiatric disorders. Here, we present an overview of the distribution of the peptidergic systems in 17 subregions of hPFC and three reference cortices obtained by microdissection and based on RNA sequencing and RNAscope methods integrated with published single-cell transcriptomics data. We detected expression of 60 neuropeptides and 60 neuropeptide receptors in at least one of the hPFC subregions. The results reveal that the peptidergic landscape in PFC consists of closely located and functionally different subregions with unique peptide/transmitter-related profiles. Neuropeptide-rich PFC subregions were identified, encompassing regions from anterior cingulate cortex/orbitofrontal gyrus. Furthermore, marked differences in gene expression exist between different PFC regions (>5-fold; cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript peptide) as well as between PFC regions and reference regions, for example, for somatostatin and several receptors. We suggest that the present approach allows definition of, still hypothetical, microcircuits exemplified by glutamatergic neurons expressing a peptide cotransmitter either as an agonist (hypocretin/orexin) or antagonist (galanin). Specific neuropeptide receptors have been identified as possible targets for neuronal afferents and, interestingly, peripheral blood-borne peptide hormones (leptin, adiponectin, gastric inhibitory peptide, glucagon-like peptides, and peptide YY). Together with other recent publications, our results support the view that neuropeptide systems may play an important role in hPFC and underpin the concept that neuropeptide signaling helps stabilize circuit connectivity and fine-tune/modulate PFC functions executed during health and disease."

Among many factors, epigenetic alterations in aberrant histone modifications play a key role in causing DKD. In this study, the mechanism of GSK-J4, a histone demethylase KDM6A inhibitor, was evaluated in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. It was confirmed that GSK-J4, via dickkopf-1 (DKK1) modulation, could significantly reduce proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis in diabetic mice. The mRNA accumulation levels of DKK1, TGF-β1, fibronectin, and collagen IV were significantly elevated in diabetic mice. In contrast, the mRNA accumulations of those genes were significantly reduced in diabetic mice treated with GSK-J4 compared to those in diabetic mice, relatively speaking. The protein accumulation levels of fibronectin and collagen IV were significantly elevated in diabetic mice. Furthermore, GSK-J4 attenuated the high glucose-induced expression of profibrotic factors in mesangial cells via DKK1. In conclusion, our study provides a novel strategy to eliminate fibrosis in the kidneys of DKD mice. Using GSK-J4 reduces DKK1 expression, thereby ameliorating renal insufficiency, glomerulosclerosis morphological abnormalities, inflammation, and fibrosis in diabetic mice."
"36033501","Design and experimental validation of OPERA_MET-A panel for deep methylation analysis by next generation sequencing.","Front Oncol","DNA methylation is the most recognized epigenetic mark that leads to a massive distortion in cancer cells. It has been observed that a large number of DNA aberrant methylation events occur simultaneously in a group of genes, thus providing a growth advantage to the cell in promoting cell differentiation and neoplastic transformation. Due to this reason, methylation profiles have been suggested as promising cancer biomarkers. Here, we designed and performed a first step of validation of a novel targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) panel for methylation analysis, which can simultaneously evaluate the methylation levels at CpG sites of multiple cancer-related genes. The OPERA_MET-A methylation panel was designed using the Ion AmpliSeq™ technology to amplify 155 regions with 125-175 bp mean length and covers a total of 1107 CpGs of 18 cancer-related genes. The performance of the panel was assessed by running commercially available fully methylated and unmethylated control human genomic DNA (gDNA) samples and a variable mixture of them. The libraries were run on Ion Torrent platform and the sequencing output was analyzed using the ""methylation_analysis"" plugin. DNA methylation calls on both Watson (W) and Crick (C) strands and methylated:unmethylated ratio for each CpG site were obtained. Cell lines, fresh frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) lung cancer tissues were tested. The OPERA_MET-A panel allows to run a minimum of 6 samples/530 chip to reach an observed mean target depth ≥2,500X (W and C strands) and an average number of mapped reads >750,000/sample. The conversion efficiency, determined by spiking-in unmethylated Lambda DNA into each sample before the bisulfite conversion process, was >97% for all samples. The observed percentage of global methylation for all CpGs was >95% and <5% for fully methylated and unmethylated gDNA samples, respectively, and the observed results for the variable mixtures were in agreement with what was expected. Methylation-specific NGS analysis represents a feasible method for a fast and multiplexed screening of cancer patients by a high-throughput approach. Moreover, it offers the opportunity to construct a more robust algorithm for disease prediction in cancer patients having a low quantity of biological material available.Copyright © 2022 Fabrizio, Castellana, Centra, Sparaneo, Mastroianno, Mazza, Coco, Trombetta, Cingolani, Centonza, Graziano, Maiello, Fazio and Muscarella."

Although studies have suggested thatQKIis a tumor suppressor gene, no studies have evaluated the diagnostic utility ofQKImethylation in colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, we evaluated the methylation status ofQKIby integrating the methylation data of tissues and cell lines of multiple cancer types. The diagnostic performance ofQKIwas analyzed in the discovery dataset from the TCGA CRC 450K array (n= 440) and tested in the test sets (n= 845) from the GEO. The methylation level ofQKIwas further validated in our independent dataset (n= 388) using targeted bisulfite sequencing. All detected CpG sites in theQKIpromoter showed CRC-specific hypermethylation in 31 types of tumor tissues. In the discovery dataset, six consecutive CpG sites achieved high diagnostic performances, with AUCs ranging from 0.821 to 0.930. In the test set, a region (chr6: 163,834,452-163,834,924) including four consecutive CpG sites had robust diagnostic ability in distinguishing CRC and adenoma from normal samples. In the validation dataset, similar robust results were observed in both early- and advanced-stage CRC patients. In addition,QKIexhibited hypermethylation in the cfDNA of patients with CRC (n = 14). Collectively, theQKIpromoter is a CRC-specific methylation biomarker and holds great promise for improving the diagnosis using minimally invasive biopsy.Copyright © 2022 Zhang, Li, Gao, Fu, Sun, Huang, Zhang, Jia, Zheng, Cui, Liu and Zhao."

It plays an important role in cancer development and drug resistance. However, the molecular mechanisms by which CDC20 regulates cellular drug response remain poorly understood. Chromatin-associated CDC20 interactome in breast cancer cells was analyzed by using affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry. hnRNPU as a CDC20 binding partner was validated by co-immunoprecipitation and immunostaining. The molecular domain, comprising amino acid residues 461-653, on hnRNPU required for its interaction with CDC20 was identified by mapping of interactions. Co-immunoprecipitation showed that CDC20-mediated hnRNPU ubiquitination promotes its interaction with the CTCF and cohesin complex. The effects of CDC20-hnRNPU on nuclear size and chromatin condensation were investigated by analyzing DAPI and H2B-mCherry staining, respectively. The role of CDC20-hnRNPU in tumor progression and drug resistance was examined by CCK-8 cell survival and clonogenic assays. Our study indicates that CDC20-mediated ubiquitination of hnRNPU modulates chromatin condensation by regulating the interaction between hnRNPU and the CTCF-cohesin complex. Dysregulation of the CDC20-hnRNPU axis contributes to tumor progression and drug resistance."

We sought to explore this through a systematic approach using different methods and data.Methods:We undertook multivariable logistic regression of the odds of CHD for 923 mass spectrometry (MS)-derived metabolites in a sub-sample of a UK birth cohort (Born in Bradford (BiB); N = 2605, 46 CHD cases). We considered metabolites reaching ap-value threshold &lt;0.05 to be suggestively associated with CHD. We sought validation of our findings, by repeating the multivariable regression analysis within the BiB cohort for any suggestively associated metabolite that was measured by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) or clinical chemistry (N = 7296, 87 CHD cases), and by using genetic risk scores (GRS: weighted genetic risk scores of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were associated with any suggestive metabolite) in Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses. The MR analyses were performed in BiB and two additional European birth cohorts (N = 38,662, 319 CHD cases).Results:In the main multivariable analyses, we identified 44 metabolites suggestively associated with CHD, including those from the following super pathways: amino acids, lipids, co-factors and vitamins, xenobiotics, nucleotides, energy, and several unknown molecules. Of these 44, isoleucine and leucine were available in the larger BiB cohort (NMR), and for these the results were validated. The MR analyses were possible for 27/44 metabolites and for 11 there was consistency with the multivariable regression results.Conclusions:In summary, we have used complimentary data sources and statistical techniques to construct layers of evidence. We found that pregnancy amino acid metabolism, androgenic steroid lipids, and levels of succinylcarnitine could be important contributing factors for CHD."

Since adenoma-carcinoma development is a slow process and may take up to 20 years, diet-based chemoprevention could be an effective approach in sporadic CRC. The Mediterranean diet is an example of a healthy diet pattern that consists of a combination of nutraceuticals that prevent several chronic diseases and cancer.

The cohort was randomly divided into training and test sets at a 1.5:1 ratio. Targeted bisulfite sequencing (TBSeq) was conducted on five pairs of preoperative and postop-erative sDNA samples from ECC patients to identify DNA methylation biomarkers, which were validated using pyrosequencing. By logistic regression analysis, a multiplex stool-based assay was developed in the training set, and the detection performance was further assessed in the test set and combined set. Theχ2test was used to investigate the association of detection sensitivity with clinico-pathological features.Following TBSeq, three hypermethylated cytosine-guanine sites were selected as biomarkers, including paired box 8, Ras-association domain family 1 and secreted frizzled-related protein 2, which differed between the groups and were involved in important cancer pathways. An sDNA panel containing the three biomarkers was constructed with a logistic model. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that this panel was superior to the fecal immunochemical test (FIT) or serum carcinoembryonic antigen for the detection of ECC. We further found that the combination of the sDNA panel with FIT could improve the screening effectiveness. In the combined set, the sensitivity, specificity and area under the ROC curve for this multiplex assay were 80.0%, 93.6% and 0.918, respectively, and the performance remained excellent in the subgroup analysis by tumor stage. In addition, the detection sensitivity did not differ with tumor site, tumor stage, histological differentiation, age or sex, but was significantly higher in T4 than in T1-3 stage tumors (P= 0.041).We identified a novel multiplex stool-based assay combining sDNA methylation biomarkers and FIT, which could detect ECC with high sensitivity and specificity throughout the colon, showing a promising application perspective.©The Author(s) 2022.

The analysis of scRNA-seq data is challenging because of transcripts sparsity, replication noise, and outlier cell populations. A gene coexpression network (GCN) analysis effectively deciphers phenotypic differences in specific states by describing gene-gene pairwise relationships. The underlying gene modules with different coexpression patterns partially bridge the gap between genotype and phenotype. This study presents a new framework called scGENA (single-cell gene coexpression network analysis) for GCN analysis based on scRNA-seq data. Although there are several methods for scRNA-seq data analysis, we aim to build an integrative pipeline for several purposes that cover primary data preprocessing, including data exploration, quality control, normalization, imputation, and dimensionality reduction of clustering as downstream of GCN analysis. To demonstrate this integrated workflow, an scRNA-seq dataset of the human diabetic pancreas with 1600 cells and 39,851 genes was implemented to perform all these processes in practice. As a result, scGENA is demonstrated to uncover interesting gene modules behind complex diseases, which reveal biological mechanisms. scGENA provides a state-of-the-art method for gene coexpression analysis for scRNA-seq data."

Here, by genetic targeting to ablate CaV1.3 RNA editing, we demonstrate that unedited CaV1.3ΔECSmice exhibited improved learning and enhanced long-term memory, supporting a functional role of RNA editing in behavior. Significantly, the editing paradox that functional recoding of CaV1.3 RNA editing sites slows Ca2+-dependent inactivation to increase Ca2+influx but reduces channel open probability to decrease Ca2+influx was resolved. Mechanistically, using hippocampal slice recordings, we provide evidence that unedited CaV1.3 channels permitted larger Ca2+influx into the hippocampal pyramidal neurons to bolster neuronal excitability, synaptic transmission, late long-term potentiation, and increased dendritic arborization. Of note, RNA editing of the CaV1.3 IQ-domain was found to be evolutionarily conserved in mammals, which lends support to the importance of the functional recoding of the CaV1.3 channel in brain function."

Two data sets (GSE126044 and GSE135222) were used as validation sets. Genes screened for modeling by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and used to construct a model based on immunophenotyping score (IPTS). RNA extraction and qPCR were performed to validate the prognostic value of IPTS in our independent LUSC cohort. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed to determine the predictive value of the immune efficacy. Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis was performed to evaluate the prognostic predictive ability. Correlation analysis and enrichment analysis were used to explore the potential mechanism of IPTS molecular typing involved in predicting the immunotherapy efficacy for patients with LUSC.The training set was divided into a low immune cell infiltration type (C1) and a high immune cell infiltration type (C2) by NMF typing, and the IPTS molecular typing based on the 17-gene model could replace the results of the NMF typing. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.82. In both validation sets, the IPTS of patients who responded to immunotherapy were significantly higher than those who did not respond to immunotherapy (P = 0.0032 and P = 0.0451), whereas the AUC was 0.95 (95% CI = 1.00-0.84) and 0.77 (95% CI = 0.58-0.96), respectively. In our independent cohort, we validated its ability to predict the response to cancer immunotherapy, for the AUC was 0.88 (95% CI = 1.00-0.66). GSEA suggested that the high IPTS group was mainly involved in immune-related signaling pathways.IPTS molecular typing based on the degree of TIIC in the TME could well predict the efficacy of immunotherapy in patients with LUSC with a certain prognostic value.© 2022.

We have shown that Loureirin B (LrB) can inhibit osteoclasts. In this study, we demonstrated the targeting-inhibitory mechanism of LrB acting on osteoclast precursor. Using SPR, HPLC and MALDI-TOF-MS to capture and analyze the target protein of Loureirin B in bone marrow macrophages (BMMs), we used this method to detect all target proteins that LrB acts on BMMs, and analyzed the distribution and enrichment rate of the target protein by DAVID enrichment analysis. Ledock molecular docking was used to detect the binding of LrB. We used Western Blot for verification. The target proteins of LrB acting on BMMs were Serpine1, Atp6ap1, Dvl1, Rhd, Fzd2, MAPK1, MAP2K2, MAPK3 and so on. MAPK1, MAP2K2 and MAPK3 were the most relevant. LrB treatment attenuated the expression of phosphorylated JNK and p38 kinases of the MAPK signaling pathway. Our research further confirmed that LrB affects the MAPK signaling pathway in BMMs, thereby inhibiting the differentiation of BMMs into osteoclasts. This discovery can confirm the mechanism by which LrB acts on BMMs.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Currently, approximately 537 million adults (20-79 years) have diabetes, and the total number of people with diabetes is continuously increasing. Diabetes includes several subtypes. About 80% of all cases of diabetes are type 2 diabetes (T2D). T2D is a polygenic disease with an inheritance ranging from 30 to 70%. Genetic and environment/lifestyle factors, especially obesity and sedentary lifestyle, increase the risk of T2D. In this review, we discuss how studies on the genetics of diabetes started, how they expanded when genome-wide association studies and exome and whole-genome sequencing became available, and the current challenges in genetic studies of diabetes. T2D is heterogeneous with respect to clinical presentation, disease course, and response to treatment, and has several subgroups which differ in pathophysiology and risk of micro- and macrovascular complications. Currently, genetic studies of T2D focus on these subgroups to find the best diagnoses and treatments for these patients according to the principles ofprecision medicine."

In a previous study, a low mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number was associated with poorer prognosis and induced EMT in ESCC. However, the detailed mechanism related to mtDNA copy number and EMT is unclear. The aim of this study was to clarify the mechanism by which a change in mtDNA copy number contributes to EMT and to examine treatment of chemotherapy resistance in ESCC.The association between low mtDNA copy number and chemotherapy resistance was investigated using specimens from 88 patients who underwent surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Then, the mtDNA content of human ESCC cell lines, TE8 and TE11, was depleted by knockdown of mitochondrial transcription factor A expression. The present study focused on modulation of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and DNA methylation as the mechanisms by which mtDNA copy number affects EMT. mRNA and protein expression, chemotherapy sensitivity, proliferation, MMP and DNA methylation were evaluated, and in vitro and in vivo assays were conducted to clarify these mechanisms.ESCC patients with decreased mtDNA copy number who underwent R0 resection after neoadjuvant chemotherapy had significantly worse pathological response and recurrence-free survival. Additionally, low mtDNA copy number was associated with resistance to chemotherapy in vitro and in vivo. mtDNA controlled MMP, and MMP depolarization induced EMT. Depletion of mtDNA and low MMP induced DNA methylation via a DNA methylation transcription factor (DNMT), and a DNMT inhibitor suppressed EMT and improved chemotherapy sensitivity in mtDNA-depleted ESCC cells, as shown by in vitro and in vivo assays.This study showed that decreased mtDNA copy number induced EMT via modulation of MMP and DNA methylation in ESCC. Therapeutic strategies increasing mtDNA copy number and DNMT inhibitors may be effective in preventing EMT and chemosensitivity resistance.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Participants were stratified according to the presence of metabolic syndrome and different metabolic health definitions based on NCEP-ATP III criteria. Relative leukocyte mitochondrial DNA copy number was determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and corrected for leukocyte and platelet count. The associations between mitochondrial copy number and metabolic syndrome components was evaluated and adjusted for age and gender.Significant negative correlations between mtDNA copy number and BMI, waist circumference, triglyceride levels, fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, HOMA-IR and hsCRP were observed, along with a positive correlation with HDL-C levels. Mitochondrial copy number was lower in individuals with metabolic syndrome. When compared to metabolically healthy normal weight subjects, a reduction in mtDNA copy number was observed in both the metabolically healthy and unhealthy obese categories.Our data supports the association between reduced leukocyte mtDNA copy number, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. This investigation expands on the spectrum of associations between mtDNA copy number and metabolic phenotypes in different populations and underpins the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the development and progression of metabolic syndrome and its components.Copyright © 2022 Agius, Pace and Fava."

Some population and animal studies have indicated an association between theST8SIA2gene and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, there is limited information on the correlation betweenST8SIA2and autistic behavioral symptoms.In this study, 69 ASD and 76 normal control children who were age- and sex-matched were recruited.ST8SIA2expression and methylation levels were measured by reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR and pyrosequencing, respectively, and the behavioral phenotypes of ASD children were assessed.The ASD group had lowerST8SIA2gene expression levels than the control group [t(0.05/2,143)= 2.582,p= 0.011]. Moreover,ST8SIA2expression levels were positively correlated with daily life skills (rs= 0.381,p= 0.008) and negatively associated with stereotyped behaviors in the ASD group (rs= -0.510,p= 0.004).

Currently, little is known about how mental health state may affect energy-adjusted nutrient intakes among food energy under-reporters.Stratified analysis of energy-adjusted nutrient intake by mental health (poor vs. good) and age/sex was conducted using data from Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) respondents (14-70 years;n= 8,233) who were deemed as under-reporters based on Goldberg's cutoffs.Most were experiencing good mental health (95.2%). Among those reporting poor mental health, significantly lower energy-adjusted nutrient intakes tended to be found for fiber, protein, vitamins A, B2, B3, B6, B9, B12, C, and D, and calcium, potassium, and zinc (probability measures (p) < 0.05). For women (51-70 years), all micronutrient intakes, except iron, were significantly lower among those reporting poor mental health (p< 0.05). For men (31-50 years), B vitamin and most mineral intakes, except sodium, were significantly lower among those reporting poor mental health (p< 0.05). Among women (31-50 years) who reported poor mental health, higher energy-adjusted intakes were reported for vitamin B9and phosphorus (p< 0.05).Among food energy under-reporters, poor mental health tends to lower the report of specific energy-adjusted nutrient intakes that include ones critical for mental health. Future research is needed to discern if these differences may be attributed to deviations in the accurate reports of food intakes, measurement errors, or mental health states.Copyright © 2022 Davison, Araujo Almeida and Gondara."

Although various available clinical treatment options exist, patients respond with varying efficacies due to multiple factors, and there is an urgent need to discover new treatment options to improve clinical outcomes. Cuproptosis is a newly characterized form of cell death. Copper causes cuproptosis by binding to lipid-acylated components of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, leading to protein aggregation, loss of iron-sulfur cluster proteins, and eventually proteotoxic stress. Targeting copper cytotoxicity and cuproptosis are considered potential options for treating oncological diseases. The synovial hypoxic environment and the presence of excessive glycolysis in multiple cells appear to act as inhibitors of cuproptosis, which can lead to excessive survival and proliferation of multiple immune cells, such as fibroblast-like synoviocytes, effector T cells, and macrophages, further mediating inflammation and bone destruction in RA. Therefore, in this study, we attempted to elaborate and summarize the linkage of cuproptosis and key genes regulating cuproptosis to the pathological mechanisms of RA and their effects on a variety of immune cells. This study aimed to provide a theoretical basis and support for translating preclinical and experimental results of RA to clinical protocols.Copyright © 2022 Zhao, Guo, Schrodi and He."

Considering that aging will be accompanied with the emergence of various aging-related diseases, research on new antiaging drugs is still valuable. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), as tools for intercellular communication, are important components of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), and they can play pathological roles in the process of cellular senescence. In addition, EVs are similar to their original cells in functions. Therefore, EVs derived from pathological tissues or body fluids may be closely related to the progression of diseases and become potential biomarkers, while those from healthy cells may have therapeutic effects. Moreover, EVs are satisfactory drug carriers. At present, numerous studies have supported the idea that engineered EVs could improve drug targeting ability and utilization efficiency. Here, we summarize the characteristics of EVs and cellular senescence and focus on the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of EVs in various aging-related diseases, including Alzheimer disease, osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus and its complications, and skin aging.Copyright © 2022 Zixuan Sun et al."

This study explored the genetic determinants of cardiometabolic traits and metabolic syndrome at theAPOElocus in a Taiwanese population. A total of 81,387 Taiwan Biobank (TWB) participants were enrolled to undergo genotype-phenotype analysis using data from the Axiom Genome-Wide CHB arrays. Regional association analysis with conditional analysis revealed lead single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) at theAPOElocus:APOErs7412 and rs429358 for total, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels;CLPTM1rs3786505 and rs11672748 for LDL and HDL cholesterol levels; andAPOC1rs438811 andAPOE-APOC1rs439401 for serum triglyceride levels. Genotype-phenotype association analysis revealed a significant association of rs429358 and rs438811 with metabolic syndrome and of rs7412, rs438811, and rs439401 with serum albumin levels (p&lt; 0.0015). Stepwise regression analysis indicated thatCLPTM1variants were independently associated with LDL and HDL cholesterol levels (p= 3.10 × 10-15for rs3786505 andp= 1.48 × 10-15for rs11672748, respectively).APOErs429358 andAPOC1rs438811 were also independently associated with metabolic syndrome (p= 2.29 × 10-14) and serum albumin levels (p= 3.80 × 10-6), respectively. In conclusion, in addition toAPOEvariants,CLPTM1is a novel candidate locus for LDL and HDL cholesterol levels at theAPOEgene region in Taiwan. Our data also indicated thatAPOEandAPOC1variants were independently associated with metabolic syndrome and serum albumin levels, respectively.

"35958715","Psychotherapeutic Change Mechanisms and Causal Psychotherapy: Applications to Child Abuse and Trauma.","J Child Adolesc Trauma","The study of change mechanisms in psychotherapy needs to be integrated with the causality of behavior, which leads to the concept of causal psychotherapy. Causal psychotherapy is posited as a useful adjunct to standard, evidence based psychotherapies for child and youth victims of abuse and trauma. The article illustrates six processes that could be involved in causal psychotherapy in this context, from the distal to the proximal. They include the distal mechanism of activation-inhibition coordination. The most proximal one relates to executive function. The intermediate levels include ones related to co-regulation (e.g., self control), analysis-synthesis, objectivity-subjectivity, and psychological reserve, which is a new concept in the domain of psychological change mechanisms. Each of the variables can vary from high to low, with the low end being more problematic. Psychotherapy can aim to bring the patient toward adaptive levels. The literature review focuses on psychotherapeutic change mechanisms, and standard psychotherapies for child/youth abuse/trauma, especially trauma-focused cognitive behavior therapy (TF-CBT). Then, it considers causal aspects of child/youth abuse and trauma, including PTSD. The discussion relates causal therapy to the question of unifying psychology and psychotherapy under the rubric of causality as a core integrative mechanism.© The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022."

Previous studies showed that TMEM204 is related to pancreatic cancer, but its roles in other cancers remain unknown. To reveal this relationship, we conducted a pan-cancer analysis by several online databases. The expression of TMEM204 was analyzed by Oncomine and Tumor Immune Estimation Resource2.0 (TIMER2.0). The prognostic potential of TMEM204 was evaluated by the GEPIA2, UALCAN, and Oncolnc. The methylation level of gene expression was analyzed by UALCAN, and the relationship between cancer and immune invasion was displayed by TIMER2.0. The Protein-Protein Interactions Network and functional analysis of TMEM204 and its related genes were conducted by STRING and Webgestalt. We found that TMEM204 expression was up-regulated and correlated with prognosis in multiple cancers. In liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), high TMEM204 expression was associated with a good prognosis, and with high infiltrating levels of CD8+T and CD4+T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and myeloid dendritic cells. In addition, the methylation level in LIHC was higher than in normal tissues. p53 signaling pathway and Fanconi anemia pathway were implicated by KEGG pathway analysis. These results indicate that TMEM204 is associated with the prognosis, methylation, and immune invasion of cancers, especially LIHC.

Recently, the meninges, which are filled with CSF, were identified as a neuroimmunological interface, highlighting the potential of exploring central nervous system (CNS) immunity by studying CNS border compartments. Here, we summarize how single-cell transcriptomics of such border compartments advance our understanding of neurological diseases, the challenges that remain, and what opportunities novel multi-omic methods offer. Single-cell transcriptomics studies have detected cytotoxic CD4+T cells and clonally expanded T and B cells in the CSF in the autoimmune disease multiple sclerosis; clonally expanded pathogenic CD8+T cells were found in the CSF and in the brain adjacent to β-amyloid plaques of dementia patients; in patients with brain metastases, CD8+T cell clonotypes were shared between the brain parenchyma and the CSF and persisted after therapy. We also outline how novel multi-omic approaches permit the simultaneous measurements of gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and protein in the same cells, which remain to be explored in the CSF. This calls for multicenter initiatives to create single-cell atlases, posing challenges in integrating patients and modalities across centers. While high-dimensional analyses of CSF cells are challenging, they hold potential for personalized medicine by better resolving heterogeneous diseases and stratifying patients.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Here, we propose a principled framework to systematically infer gene regulation for all TFs simultaneously in cells at steady state by leveraging the intrinsic variation in the transcriptional abundance across single cells. Through modeling and simulations, we characterize how transcriptional bursts of a TF gene are propagated to its target genes, including the expected ranges of time delay and magnitude of maximum covariation. We distinguish these temporal trends from the time-invariant covariation arising from cell states, and we delineate the experimental and technical requirements for leveraging these small but meaningful cofluctuations in the presence of measurement noise. While current technology does not yet allow adequate power for definitively detecting regulatory relationships for all TFs simultaneously in cells at steady state, we investigate a small-scale dataset to inform future experimental design. This study supports the potential value of mapping regulatory connections through stochastic variation, and it motivates further technological development to achieve its full potential."

Clonal, megabase-sized circular ecDNAs in cancer are distinct from nonclonal, small sub-kilobase-sized DNAs that may arise during normal tissue homeostasis. ecDNAs enable profound changes in gene regulation beyond copy-number gains. An emerging principle of ecDNA regulation is the formation of ecDNA hubs: micrometer-sized nuclear structures of numerous copies of ecDNAs tethered by proteins in spatial proximity. ecDNA hubs enable cooperative and intermolecular sharing of DNA regulatory elements for potent and combinatorial gene activation. The 3D context of ecDNA shapes its gene expression potential, selection for clonal heterogeneity among ecDNAs, distribution through cell division, and reintegration into chromosomes. Technologies for studying gene regulation and structure of ecDNA are starting to answer long-held questions on the distinct rules that govern cancer genes beyond chromosomes.© 2022.

We constructed structural brain networks from diffusion-weighted MRI and calculated edge-wise structural connectivity as well as global and local brain network features. We also calculated presurgical cerebral oxygen delivery, and extracted perioperative variables, socioeconomic status at birth and a measure of cognitively stimulating parenting. Lower degree in the right inferior frontal gyrus (partial ρ = -0.687, p < 0.001) and reduced connectivity in a frontal-limbic sub-network including the right inferior frontal gyrus were associated with higher externalizing problem scores. Externalizing problem scores were unrelated to neonatal clinical course or home environment. However, higher internalizing problem scores were associated with earlier surgery in the neonatal period (partial ρ = -0.538, p = 0.014). Our results highlight the importance of frontal-limbic networks to the development of externalizing behaviours and provide new insights into early antecedents of behavioural impairments in CHD.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

Here we describe a method for spatially resolved chromatin accessibility profiling of tissue sections using next-generation sequencing (spatial-ATAC-seq) by combining in situ Tn5 transposition chemistry6and microfluidic deterministic barcoding5. Profiling mouse embryos using spatial-ATAC-seq delineated tissue-region-specific epigenetic landscapes and identified gene regulators involved in the development of the central nervous system. Mapping the accessible genome in the mouse and human brain revealed the intricate arealization of brain regions. Applying spatial-ATAC-seq to tonsil tissue resolved the spatially distinct organization of immune cell types and states in lymphoid follicles and extrafollicular zones.

Although epigenetic changes are well recognized in the context of myeloma cell biology, the contribution of 5-hydroxymethylcytosines (5hmC) to racial disparities in MM is unknown. Using the 5hmC-Seal and next-generation sequencing, we profiled genome-wide 5hmC in circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from 342 newly diagnosed patients with MM (n = 294), SMM (n = 18), and MGUS (n = 30). We compared differential 5hmC modifications between MM and its precursors among 227 EA and 115 AA patients. The captured 5hmC modifications in cfDNA were found to be enriched in B-cell and T-cell-derived histone modifications marking enhancers. Of the top 500 gene bodies with differential 5hmC levels between MM and SMM/MGUS, the majority (94.8%) were distinct between EA and AA and enriched with population-specific pathways, including amino acid metabolism in AA and mainly cancer-related signaling pathways in EA. These findings improved our understanding of the epigenetic contribution to racial disparities in MM and suggest epigenetic pathways that could be exploited as novel preventive strategies in high-risk populations.© 2022.

"36032309","Integration of RNA-seq and ATAC-seq identifies muscle-regulated hub genes in cattle.","Front Vet Sci","As the main product of livestock, muscle itself plays an irreplaceable role in maintaining animal body movement and regulating metabolism. Therefore, it is of great significance to explore its growth, development and regeneration to improve the meat yield and quality of livestock. In this study, we attempted to use RNA-seq and ATAC-seq techniques to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) specifically expressed in bovine skeletal muscle as potential candidates for studying the regulatory mechanisms of muscle development. Microarray data from 8 tissue samples were selected from the GEO database for analysis. First, we obtained gene modules related to each tissue through WGCNA analysis. Through Gene Ontology (GO) functional annotation, the module of lightyellow (MElightyellow) was closely related to muscle development, and 213 hub genes were screened as follow-up research targets. Further, the difference analysis showed that, except for PREB, all other candidate hub genes were up-regulated (muscle group vs. other-group). ATAC-seq analysis showed that muscle-specific accessible chromatin regions were mainly located in promoter of genes related to muscle structure development (GO:0061061), muscle cell development (GO:0055001) and muscle system process (GO:0003012), which were involved in cAMP, CGMP-PKG, MAPK, and other signaling pathways. Next, we integrated the results of RNA-seq and ATAC-seq analysis, and 54 of the 212 candidate hub genes were identified as key regulatory genes in skeletal muscle development. Finally, through motif analysis, 22 of the 54 key genes were found to be potential target genes of transcription factor MEF2C.

This is achieved through research advancing on: pore efficiency, creating mechanisms to control DNA translocation, enhancing signal-to-noise ratio, and expanding to long-read ranges. Heterogeneity regarding epigenetics would be broad as mutations in the epigenome are sensitive to cause new challenges in cancer research. Epigenetic enzymes which catalyze DNA methylation and histone modification are dysregulated in cancer cells and cause numerous heterogeneous clones to evolve. Detection of this heterogeneity in these clones plays an indispensable role in the treatment of various cancer types. With single-cell profiling, the nanopore sequencing technology could provide a simple sequence at long reads and is expected to be used soon at the bedside or doctor's office.

To overcome this barrier, we intend to perforate the ILM by use of a light-based approach which relies on the creation of vapor nanobubbles (VNBs) when irradiating photosensitizers with high intensity laser pulses. Upon collapse of these VNBs, mechanical effects can disrupt biological structures. As a photosensitizer, we explore indocyanine green (ICG) loaded nanoparticles (NPs) specifically designed for our application. In light of this, ICG liposomes and PLGA ICG NPs were characterized in terms of physicochemical properties, ICG incorporation and VNB formation. ICG liposomes were found to encapsulate significantly higher amounts of ICG compared to PLGA ICG NPs which is reflected in their VNB creating capacity. Since only ICG liposomes were able to induce VNB generation, this class of NPs was further investigated on retinal explants. Here, application of ICG liposomes followed by laser treatment resulted in subtle disruption effects at the ILM where zones of fully ablated ILM were alternated by intact regions. As the interaction between the ICG liposomes and ILM might be insufficient, active targeting strategies or other NP designs might improve the concept to a further extent."

Pten deletion in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) promotes potent optic nerve regeneration, but only a small population of Pten-null RGCs are actually regenerating RGCs (regRGCs); most surviving RGCs (surRGCs) remain non-regenerative. Here, we developed a strategy to specifically label and purify regRGCs and surRGCs, respectively, from the same Pten-deletion mice after optic nerve crush, in which they differ only in their regeneration capability. Smart-Seq2 single-cell transcriptome analysis revealed novel regeneration-associated genes that significantly promote axon regeneration. The most potent of these, Anxa2, acts synergistically with its ligand tPA in Pten-deletion-induced axon regeneration. Anxa2, its downstream effector ILK, and Mpp1 dramatically protect RGC somata and axons and preserve visual function in a clinically relevant model of glaucoma, demonstrating the exciting potential of this innovative strategy to identify novel effective neural repair candidates.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

This study aimed to investigate whether ascorbic acid can be used to treat salivary gland dysfunction in an extensive aging mouse model of SAMP1/Klotho-/- mice. In our previous study, we found that ascorbic acid biosynthesis was disrupted in the salivary glands of SAMP1/Klotho (-/-) mice subjected to metabolomic profiling analysis. In SAMP1/Klotho -/- mice, daily supplementation with ascorbic acid (100 mg/kg for 18 days) significantly increased saliva secretion compared with the control. The expression of salivary gland functional markers (α-amylase, ZO-1, and Aqua5) is upregulated. Additionally, acetylcholine and/or beta-adrenergic receptors (M1AchR, M3AchR, and Adrb1) were increased by ascorbic acid in the salivary glands of aging mice, and treatment with ascorbic acid upregulated the expression of acetylcholine receptors through the DNA demethylation protein TET2. These results suggest that ascorbic acid could overcome the lack caused by dysfunction of ascorbic acid biosynthesis and induce the recovery of salivary gland function."

Here, we report for the first time on a patient with a de novo stop-gain variant inMYRF(p.Q838*) associated with Scimitar syndrome, 46,XY partial gonadal dysgenesis (GD) and severe hyperopia. Since variants inMYRFhave been described in both 46,XX and 46,XY GD, we assumed a role ofMYRFin the early development of the bipotential gonad. We used publicly available single cell sequencing data of human testis and ovary from different developmental stages and analysed them forMYRFexpression. We identifiedMYRFexpression in the subset of coelomic epithelial cells at stages of gonadal ridge development in 46,XX and 46,XY individuals. Differential gene expression analysis revealed significantly upregulated genes. Within these, we identifiedCITED2as a gene containing a MYRF binding site. It has been shown thatCited2-/-mice have gonadal defects in both testis and ovary differentiation, as well as defects in heart development and establishment of the left-right axis.

In the brain, the substrates of furin include the proproteins of growth factors, receptors and enzymes. Emerging evidence, such as reduced FURIN mRNA expression in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients or schizophrenia patients, has implicated a crucial role of furin in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases. Currently, compared to cancer and infectious diseases, the aberrant expression of furin and its pharmaceutical potentials in neurological diseases remain poorly understood. In this article, we provide an overview on the physiological roles of furin and its substrates in the brain, summarize the deregulation of furin expression and its effects in neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders, and discuss the implications and current approaches that target furin for therapeutic interventions. This review may expedite future studies to clarify the molecular mechanisms of furin deregulation and involvement in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases, and to develop new diagnosis and treatment strategies for these diseases.© 2022.

However, only few studies have explored Alzheimer's disease (AD) despite the possibility of biological subtypes within these patients. For this study, unsupervised classification of four datasets (genetics, miRNA transcriptomics, proteomics, and blood-based biomarkers) using Multi-Omics Factor Analysis+ (MOFA+), along with systems-biological approaches following various downstream analyses are performed. New subgroups within 170 patients with cerebral amyloid pathology (Aβ+) are revealed and the features of them are identified based on the top-rated targets constructing multi-omics factors of both whole (M-TPAD) and immune-focused models (M-IPAD). The authors explored the characteristics of subtypes and possible key-drivers for AD pathogenesis. Further in-depth studies showed that these subtypes are associated with longitudinal brain changes and autophagy pathways are main contributors. The significance of autophagy or clustering tendency is validated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs; n = 120 including 30 Aβ- and 90 Aβ+), induced pluripotent stem cell-derived human brain organoids/microglia (n = 12 including 5 Aβ-, 5 Aβ+, and CRISPR-Cas9 apolipoprotein isogenic lines), and human brain transcriptome (n = 78).

"35990615","Regulatory role of RNA N<sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine modifications during skeletal muscle development.","Front Cell Dev Biol","Functional cells in embryonic myogenesis and postnatal muscle development undergo multiple stages of proliferation and differentiation, which are strict procedural regulation processes. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant RNA modification that regulates gene expression in specific cell types in eukaryotes and regulates various biological activities, such as RNA processing and metabolism. Recent studies have shown that m6A modification-mediated transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation plays an essential role in myogenesis. This review outlines embryonic and postnatal myogenic differentiation and summarizes the important roles played by functional cells in each developmental period. Furthermore, the key roles of m6A modifications and their regulators in myogenesis were highlighted, and the synergistic regulation of m6A modifications with myogenic transcription factors was emphasized to characterize the cascade of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation during myogenesis. This review also discusses the crosstalk between m6A modifications and non-coding RNAs, proposing a novel mechanism for post-transcriptional regulation during skeletal muscle development. In summary, the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms mediated by m6A and their regulators may help develop new strategies to maintain muscle homeostasis, which are expected to become targets for animal muscle-specific trait breeding and treatment of muscle metabolic diseases.Copyright © 2022 Yu, Liu, Zhang, Mu, Feng, Ma and Gu."

Here, we delineate spatially regulated imprinting ofIGF2transcripts, age-dependent hepatic mono- to biallelic conversion, and reorganization of topologically associating domains at the porcineH19/IGF2locus for better translation to human and animal research. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of normal and parthenogenetic porcine embryos revealed the paternally hypermethylatedH19differentially methylated region and paternal expression ofIGF2. Using a polymorphism-based approach and omics datasets from chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), whole-genome sequencing (WGS), RNA-seq, and Hi-C, regulation ofIGF2during development was analyzed. Regulatory elements in the liver were distinguished from those in the muscle where the porcineIGF2transcript was monoallelically expressed. TheIGF2transcript from the liver was biallelically expressed at later developmental stages in both pigs and humans. Chromatin interaction was less frequent in the adult liver compared to the fetal liver and skeletal muscle. The duration of genomic imprinting effects within theH19/IGF2locus might be reduced in the liver with biallelic conversion through alternative promoter usage and chromatin remodeling.

During HIV infection, neuroinflammation is associated with cognitive impairment, even during sustained long-term suppressive antiretroviral therapy. However, the cellular subsets contributing to neuronal damage in the CNS during HIV infection remain unclear. Using post-mortem brain samples from eight HIV patients and eight non-neurological disease controls, we identify a subset of CNS phagocytes highly enriched in LGALS3, CTSB, GPNMB and HLA-DR, a signature identified in the context of ageing and neurodegeneration. In HIV patients, the presence of this phagocyte phenotype was associated with synaptic stripping, suggesting an involvement in the pathogenesis of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder. Taken together, our findings elucidate some of the molecular signatures adopted by CNS phagocytes in HIV-positive patients and contribute to the understanding of how HIV might pave the way to other forms of cognitive decline in ageing HIV patient populations.© The Author(s) 2022.

Here we explore alterations in dopamine-related behavior in a new mouse model based on stimulant (cocaine)-induced hyperactivity. In combination with cocaine, infection resulted in heightened sensorimotor deficits and impairment in prepulse inhibition response, which are commonly disrupted in neuropsychiatric conditions. To identify molecular pathways in the brain affected by chronic T. gondii infection, we investigated patterns of gene expression. As expected, infection was associated with an enrichment of genes associated with general immune response pathways, that otherwise limits statistical power to identify more informative pathways. To overcome this limitation and focus on pathways of neurological relevance, we developed a novel context enrichment approach that relies on a customized ontology. Applying this approach, we identified genes that exhibited unexpected patterns of expression arising from the combination of cocaine exposure and infection. These include sets of genes which exhibited dampened response to cocaine in infected mice, suggesting a possible mechanism for some observed behaviors and a neuroprotective effect that may be advantageous to parasite persistence. This model offers a powerful new approach to dissect the molecular pathways by which T. gondii infection contributes to neurocognitive disorders."

IA infections have been increasing, which remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. During the past decade, antifungal drug resistance has emerged, which is especially concerning for management given the limited options for treating azole-resistant infections and the possibility of failure of prophylaxis in those high-risk patients. Histone posttranslational modifications (HPTMs), mainly including acetylation, methylation, ubiquitination and phosphorylation, are crucial epigenetic mechanisms regulating various biological events, which could modify the conformation of histone and influence chromatin-associated nuclear processes to regulate development, cellular responsiveness, and biological phenotype without affecting the underlying genetic sequence. In recent years, fungi have become important model organisms for studying epigenetic regulation. HPTMs involves in growth and development, secondary metabolite biosynthesis and virulence inAspergillus. This review mainly aims at summarizing the acetylation, deacetylation, methylation, demethylation, and sumoylation of histones in IA and connect this knowledge to possible HPTMs-based antifungal drugs.

Restrictive ventilatory defects (RVD) are prevalent, with risks increasing after exposures to chest radiotherapy and radiomimetic chemotherapies. Using whole-genome sequencing data from 1,728 childhood cancer survivors in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study, we developed and validated a composite RVD risk prediction model that integrates clinical profiles and polygenic risk scores (PRS), including both published lung phenotype PRSs and a novel survivor-specific pharmaco/radiogenomic PRS (surPRS) for RVD risk reflecting gene-by-treatment (GxT) interaction effects. Overall, this new therapy-specific polygenic risk prediction model showed multiple indicators for superior discriminatory accuracy in an independent data set. The surPRS was significantly associated with RVD risk in both training (OR = 1.60, P = 3.7 × 10-10) and validation (OR = 1.44, P = 8.5 × 10-4) data sets. The composite model featuring the surPRS showed the best discriminatory accuracy (AUC = 0.81; 95% CI, 0.76-0.87), a significant improvement (P = 9.0 × 10-3) over clinical risk scores only (AUC = 0.78; 95% CI: 0.72-0.83). The odds of RVD in survivors in the highest quintile of composite model-predicted risk was ∼20-fold higher than those with median predicted risk or less (OR = 20.01, P = 2.2 × 10-16), exceeding the comparable estimate considering nongenetic risk factors only (OR = 9.20, P = 7.4 × 10-11). Inclusion of genetic predictors also selectively improved risk stratification for pulmonary complications across at-risk primary cancer diagnoses (AUCclinical = 0.72; AUCcomposite = 0.80, P = 0.012). Overall, this PRS approach that leverages GxT interaction effects supports late effects risk prediction among childhood cancer survivors.This study develops a therapy-specific polygenic risk prediction model to more precisely identify childhood cancer survivors at high risk for pulmonary complications, which could help improve risk stratification for other late effects.©2022 American Association for Cancer Research."

Blood samples were collected in two seasons, differing in the concentration of PM in the air (below or above a daily limit of 50 µg/m3for PM 10). Data show that PBMCs exposed in vitro to PM KRK upregulated the expression of genes involved, among others, in pro-inflammatory response, cell motility, and regulation of cell metabolism. The transcriptional effects were observed predominantly in the group of patients with AS and MS. The observed changes seem to be dependent on the seasonal concentration of PM in the air of Krakow and may suggest their important role in the progression of AS, MS, and RA in the residents of Krakow."

The reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) platform identified N = 631 differentially methylated CpG sites which annotated to N = 408 genes (DMGs) in circulating CD4+T cells isolated from PAH patients vs. healthy controls (CTRLs). A promoter-restricted network analysis established the PAH subnetwork that included 5 hub DMGs (SOCS3, GNAS, ITGAL, NCOR2, NFIC) and 5 non-hub DMGs (NR4A2, GRM2, PGK1, STMN1, LIMS2). The functional analysis revealed that the SOCS3 gene was the most recurrent among the top ten significant pathways enriching the PAH subnetwork, including the growth hormone receptor and the interleukin-6 signaling. Correlation analysis showed that the promoter methylation levels of each network-oriented DMG were associated individually with hemodynamic parameters. In particular, SOCS3 hypomethylation was negatively associated with right atrial pressure (RAP) and positively associated with cardiac index (CI) (|r|≥ 0.6). A significant upregulation of the SOCS3, ITGAL, NFIC, NCOR2, and PGK1 mRNA levels (qRT-PCR) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from PAH patients vs. CTRLs was found (P ≤ 0.05). By immunoblotting, a significant upregulation of the SOCS3 protein was confirmed in PAH patients vs. CTRLs (P < 0.01). This is the first network-oriented study which integrates circulating CD4+T cell DNA methylation signatures, hemodynamic parameters, and validation experiments in PAH patients at first diagnosis or early follow-up.

Here, we report extensive basecalling induced errors at telomere repeats across nanopore datasets, sequencing platforms, basecallers, and basecalling models. We find that telomeres in many organisms are frequently miscalled. We demonstrate that tuning of nanopore basecalling models leads to improved recovery and analysis of telomeric regions, with minimal negative impact on other genomic regions. We highlight the importance of verifying nanopore basecalls in long, repetitive, and poorly defined regions, and showcase how artefacts can be resolved by improvements in nanopore basecalling models.© 2022.

"35978051","Genome characterization and CRISPR-Cas9 editing of a human neocentromere.","Chromosoma","The maintenance of genome integrity is ensured by proper chromosome inheritance during mitotic and meiotic cell divisions. The chromosomal counterpart responsible for chromosome segregation to daughter cells is the centromere, at which the spindle apparatus attaches through the kinetochore. Although all mammalian centromeres are primarily composed of megabase-long repetitive sequences, satellite-free human neocentromeres have been described. Neocentromeres and evolutionary new centromeres have revolutionized traditional knowledge about centromeres. Over the past 20 years, insights have been gained into their organization, but in spite of these advancements, the mechanisms underlying their formation and evolution are still unclear. Today, through modern and increasingly accessible genome editing and long-read sequencing techniques, research in this area is undergoing a sudden acceleration. In this article, we describe the primary sequence of a previously described human chromosome 3 neocentromere and observe its possible evolution and repair results after a chromosome breakage induced through CRISPR-Cas9 technologies. Our data represent an exciting advancement in the field of centromere/neocentromere evolution and chromosome stability.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35931048","Neurodevelopmental copy-number variants: A roadmap to improving outcomes by uniting patient advocates, researchers, and clinicians for collective impact.","Am J Hum Genet","Copy-number variants and structural variants (CNVs/SVs) drive many neurodevelopmental-related disorders. While many neurodevelopmental-related CNVs/SVs give rise to complex phenotypes, the overlap in phenotypic presentation between independent CNVs can be extensive and provides a motivation for shared approaches. This confluence at the level of clinical phenotype implies convergence in at least some aspects of the underlying genomic mechanisms. With this perspective, our Commission on Novel Technologies for Neurodevelopmental CNVs asserts that the time has arrived to approach neurodevelopmental-related CNVs/SVs as a class of disorders that can be identified, investigated, and treated on the basis of shared mechanisms and/or pathways (e.g., molecular, neurological, or developmental). To identify common etiologic mechanisms among uncommon neurodevelopmental-related disorders and to potentially identify common therapies, it is paramount for teams of scientists, clinicians, and patients to unite their efforts. We bring forward novel, collaborative, and integrative strategies to translational CNV/SV research that engages diverse stakeholders to help expedite therapeutic outcomes. We articulate a clear vision for piloted roadmap strategies to reduce patient/caregiver burden and redundancies, increase efficiency, avoid siloed data, and accelerate translational discovery across CNV/SV-based syndromes.Copyright © 2022 American Society of Human Genetics.

"36008969","Effects of Aging and Disease Conditions in Brain of Tumor-Bearing Mice: Evaluation of Purine DNA Damages and Fatty Acid Pool Changes.","Biomolecules","The consequences of aging and disease conditions in tissues involve reactive oxygen species (ROS) and related molecular alterations of different cellular compartments. We compared a murine model of immunodeficient (SCID) xenografted young (4 weeks old) and old (17 weeks old) mice with corresponding controls without tumor implantation and carried out a compositional evaluation of brain tissue for changes in parallel DNA and lipids compartments. DNA damage was measured by four purine 5',8-cyclo-2'-deoxynucleosides, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG), and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyadenosine (8-oxo-dA). In brain lipids, the twelve most representative fatty acid levels, which were mostly obtained from the transformation of glycerophospholipids, were followed up during the aging and disease progressions. The progressive DNA damage due to age and tumoral conditions was confirmed by raised levels of 5'S-cdG and 5'S-cdA. In the brain, the remodeling involved a diminution of palmitic acid accompanied by an increase in arachidonic acid, along both age and tumor progressions, causing increases in the unsaturation index, the peroxidation index, and total TFA as indicators of increased oxidative and free radical reactivity. Our results contribute to the ongoing debate on the central role of DNA and genome instability in the aging process, and on the need for a holistic vision, which implies choosing the best biomarkers for such monitoring. Furthermore, our data highlight brain tissue for its lipid remodeling response and inflammatory signaling, which seem to prevail over the effects of DNA damage."
"35999337","Old plasma dilution reduces human biological age: a clinical study.","Geroscience","This work extrapolates to humans the previous animal studies on blood heterochronicity and establishes a novel direct measurement of biological age. Our results support the hypothesis that, similar to mice, human aging is driven by age-imposed systemic molecular excess, the attenuation of which reverses biological age, defined in our work as a deregulation (noise) of 10 novel protein biomarkers. The results on biological age are strongly supported by the data, which demonstrates that rounds of therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) promote a global shift to a younger systemic proteome, including youthfully restored pro-regenerative, anticancer, and apoptotic regulators and a youthful profile of myeloid/lymphoid markers in circulating cells, which have reduced cellular senescence and lower DNA damage. Mechanistically, the circulatory regulators of the JAK-STAT, MAPK, TGF-beta, NF-κB, and Toll-like receptor signaling pathways become more youthfully balanced through normalization of TLR4, which we define as a nodal point of this molecular rejuvenation. The significance of our findings is confirmed through big-data gene expression studies.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Recently, interest in senotherapeutics has been growing rapidly to promote healthy aging and as an intervention for ARCs. This research focused on screening the senomorphic properties ofArtemisia argyi,as an emerging strategy for longevity, and prevention or treatment of ARCs. In this study, we aimed to find the clinical efficacy of daily consumption ofArtemisia argyiwater extract (AAW) on aging.In vitro0.1μM Doxorubicin induced senescent human adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells was treated with different concentrations of AAW to show its anti-aging effect. 15 months old SHR rats (n=6) were treated with 7.9 mg/ml AAW for 4 weeks and anti-aging effect was evaluated.In vitrostudy showed the protective effect of AAW in telomere shortening and helps in maintaining a balance in the expression of anti-aging protein Klotho and TERT. AAW effectively reduced mitochondrial superoxide and also provided a protective shield against senescence markers like over-expression of p21 and formation of double strand breaks, which is known to cause premature aging. Moreover, animal studies indicated that AAW promoted the expression of Klotho in naturally aging rats. In addition, AAW successfully restored the decline cardiac function and improved the grip strength and memory of aging rat. These findings showed that therapeutic targeting of senescent stem cells by AAW restored stem cell homeostasis and improves overall health."

A hand search of reference lists of relevant articles was also performed.Key study inclusion criteria in this meta-analysis were as follows: adult human study population, measurement of any marker of DNA or RNA damage from oxidative stress, and either a (1) cross-sectional design comparing patients with psychiatric disorders (any diagnosis) with a control group or (2) prospective intervention. Two authors screened the studies, and 2 senior authors read the relevant articles in full and assessed them for eligibility.The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Two authors performed data extraction independently, and a senior coauthor was consulted in cases of disagreement. Data were synthesized with random-effects and multilevel meta-analyses.The predefined hypothesis was that individuals with psychiatric disorders have increased NA-OXS levels. The main outcome was the standardized mean differences (SMDs) among patients and controls in nucleic acid oxidation markers compared across diagnostic groups. Analyses were divided into combinations of biological matrices and nucleic acids.Eighty-two studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria, comprising 205 patient vs control group comparisons and a total of 10 151 patient and 10 532 control observations. Overall, the data showed that patients with psychiatric disorders had higher NA-OXS levels vs controls across matrices and molecules. Pooled effect sizes ranged from moderate for urinary DNA markers (SMD = 0.44 [95% CI, 0.20-0.68]; P < .001) to very large for blood cell DNA markers (SMD = 1.12 [95% CI, 0.69-1.55; P < .001). Higher NA-OXS levels were observed among patients with dementias followed by psychotic and bipolar disorders. Sensitivity analyses excluding low-quality studies did not materially alter the results. Intervention studies were few and too heterogenous for meaningful meta-analysis.The results of this meta-analysis suggest that there is an association with increased NA-OXS levels in individuals across the psychiatric disorder diagnostic spectrum. NA-OXS may play a role in the somatic morbidity and mortality observed among individuals with psychiatric disorders."

Unfavourable alleles of the markers nearby the genes which are associated with lung and heart diseases such as Tumor necrosis factor superfamily (TNFSF4&18), showed noteworthy association with the disease severity and outcome for the COVID-19 patients in the western Indian population. The markers found with significant association with disease prognosis or recovery are of value in determining the individual's response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and can be used for the risk prediction in COVID-19.

"35966405","Interpreting Neural Networks for Biological Sequences by Learning Stochastic Masks.","Nat Mach Intell","Sequence-based neural networks can learn to make accurate predictions from large biological datasets, but model interpretation remains challenging. Many existing feature attribution methods are optimized for continuous rather than discrete input patterns and assess individual feature importance in isolation, making them ill-suited for interpreting non-linear interactions in molecular sequences. Building on work in computer vision and natural language processing, we developed an approach based on deep learning - Scrambler networks - wherein the most salient sequence positions are identified with learned input masks. Scramblers learn to predict Position-Specific Scoring Matrices (PSSMs) where unimportant nucleotides or residues are scrambled by raising their entropy. We apply Scramblers to interpret the effects of genetic variants, uncover non-linear interactions between cis-regulatory elements, explain binding specificity for protein-protein interactions, and identify structural determinants ofde novodesigned proteins. We show that Scramblers enable efficient attribution across large datasets and result in high-quality explanations, often outperforming state-of-the-art methods."

In this study, 160 COVID-19 patients were enrolled, of whom 80 had a ""non-severe"" and 80 had a ""severe"" outcome. Sera were analyzed by proximity extension assay (PEA) to assess 274 unique proteins associated with inflammation, cardiometabolic, and neurologic diseases. The main clinical and hematochemical data associated with disease outcome were grouped with serological data to form a dataset for the supervised machine learning techniques. We identified nine proteins (i.e., CD200R1, MCP1, MCP3, IL6, LTBP2, MATN3, TRANCE, α2-MRAP, and KIT) that contributed to the correct classification of COVID-19 disease severity when combined with relative neutrophil and lymphocyte counts. By analyzing PEA, clinical and hematochemical data with statistical methods that were able to handle many variables in the presence of a relatively small sample size, we identified nine potential serum biomarkers of a ""severe"" outcome. Most of these were confirmed by literature data. Importantly, we found three biomarkers associated with central nervous system pathologies and protective factors, which were downregulated in the most severe cases."

Autopsies of 20 covid-19 cases and 14 controls from the first pandemic wave complemented with microbial cultivation and RNA-seq from lung tissues enabled description of major organ pathologies and specification of secondary infections. Lethal covid-19 segregated into two main death causes with either dominant diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) or secondary pneumonias. The lung microbiome in covid-19 showed a reduced biodiversity and increased prototypical bacterial and fungal pathogens in cases of secondary pneumonias. RNA-seq distinctly mirrored death causes and stratified DAD cases into subgroups with differing cellular compositions identifying myeloid cells, macrophages and complement C1q as strong separating factors suggesting a pathophysiological link.

Here, we prioritise eight robust (e.g., ELF5) or suggestive but unreported (e.g., RAB2A) candidate protein mediators of COVID-19 outcomes by integrating results from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative with population-based plasma proteomics using statistical colocalisation. The transcription factor ELF5 (ELF5) shows robust and directionally consistent associations across different outcome definitions, including a >4-fold higher risk (odds ratio: 4.88; 95%-CI: 2.47-9.63; p-value < 5.0 × 10-6) for severe COVID-19 per 1 s.d. higher genetically predicted plasma ELF5. We show that ELF5 is specifically expressed in epithelial cells of the respiratory system, such as secretory and alveolar type 2 cells, using single-cell RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry. These cells are also likely targets of SARS-CoV-2 by colocalisation with key host factors, including ACE2 and TMPRSS2. In summary, large-scale human genetic studies together with gene expression at single-cell resolution highlight ELF5 as a risk gene for severe COVID-19, supporting a role of epithelial cells of the respiratory system in the adverse host response to SARS-CoV-2.© 2022.

Neurofilament light is a cross-disease biomarker for neuronal damage with potential clinical applicability for monitoring Intensive Care Unit patients. We studied the trajectory of neurofilament light over a month in Intensive Care Unit patients diagnosed with severe COVID-19 and explored its relation to clinical outcomes and pathophysiological predictors. Data were collected over a month in 31 Intensive Care Unit patients (166 plasma samples) diagnosed with severe COVID-19 at Amsterdam University Medical Centre, and in the first week after emergency department admission in 297 patients with COVID-19 (635 plasma samples) admitted to Massachusetts General hospital. We observed that Neurofilament light increased in a non-linear fashion in the first month of Intensive Care Unit admission and increases faster in the first week of Intensive Care Unit admission when compared with mild-moderate COVID-19 cases. We observed that baseline Neurofilament light did not predict mortality when corrected for age and renal function. Peak neurofilament light levels were associated with a longer duration of delirium after extubation in Intensive Care Unit patients. Disease severity, as measured by the sequential organ failure score, was associated to higher neurofilament light values, and tumour necrosis factor alpha levels at baseline were associated with higher levels of neurofilament light at baseline and a faster increase during admission. These data illustrate the dynamics of Neurofilament light in a critical care setting and show associations to delirium, disease severity and markers for inflammation.

We performed plasma deep proteomic profiling from 332 COVID-19 patients and 150 controls and pursued replication in an independent cohort (297 cases and 76 controls) to find potential biomarkers and causal proteins for three COVID-19 outcomes (infection, ventilation, and death). We identified and replicated 1,449 proteins associated with any of the three outcomes (841 for infection, 833 for ventilation, and 253 for death) that can be query on a web portal ( https://covid.proteomics.wustl.edu/ ). Using those proteins and machine learning approached we created and validated specific prediction models for ventilation (AUC>0.91), death (AUC>0.95) and either outcome (AUC>0.80). These proteins were also enriched in specific biological processes, including immune and cytokine signaling (FDR ≤ 3.72×10-14), Alzheimer's disease (FDR ≤ 5.46×10-10) and coronary artery disease (FDR ≤ 4.64×10-2).

"35762593","The Kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Development Is Associated with Clearance of RNAemia.","mBio","Persistent SARS-CoV-2 replication and systemic dissemination are linked to increased COVID-19 disease severity and mortality. However, the precise immune profiles that track with enhanced viral clearance, particularly from systemic RNAemia, remain incompletely defined. To define whether antibody characteristics, specificities, or functions that emerge during natural infection are linked to accelerated containment of viral replication, we examined the relationship of SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral immune evolution in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 plasma RNAemia, which is tightly associated with disease severity and death. On presentation to the emergency department, S-specific IgG3, IgA1, and Fc-γ-receptor (Fcγ R) binding antibodies were all inversely associated with higher baseline plasma RNAemia. Importantly, the rapid development of spike (S) and its subunit (S1/S2/receptor binding domain)-specific IgG, especially FcγR binding activity, were associated with clearance of RNAemia. These results point to a potentially critical and direct role for SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral immune clearance on viral dissemination, persistence, and disease outcome, providing novel insights for the development of more effective therapeutics to resolve COVID-19.IMPORTANCEWe showed that persistent SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia is an independent predictor of severe COVID-19. We observed that SARS-CoV-2-targeted antibody maturation, specifically Fc-effector functions rather than neutralization, was strongly linked with the ability to rapidly clear viremia. This highlights the critical role of key humoral features in preventing viral dissemination or accelerating viremia clearance and provides insights for the design of next-generation monoclonal therapeutics. The main key points will be that (i) persistent SARS-CoV-2 plasma RNAemia independently predicts severe COVID-19 and (ii) specific humoral immune functions play a critical role in halting viral dissemination and controlling COVID-19 disease progression."

Increased frequency or activity of autoreactive T cells and failures of regulatory T cells (Tregs) to control these pathogenic effectors have both been implicated in T1D etiology. Due to the expression of MHC class I molecules on β cells, CD8 T cells represent the ultimate effector population mediating T1D. Developing autoreactive CD8 T cells normally undergo extensive thymic negative selection, but this process is impaired in NOD mice and also likely T1D patients. Previous studies identified an allelic variant ofNfkbid, a NF-κB signal modulator, as a gene strongly contributing to defective thymic deletion of autoreactive CD8 T cells in NOD mice. These previous studies found ablation ofNfkbidin NOD mice using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats system resulted in greater thymic deletion of pathogenic CD8 AI4 and NY8.3 TCR transgenic T cells but an unexpected acceleration of T1D onset. This acceleration was associated with reductions in the frequency of peripheral Tregs. In this article, we report transgenic overexpression ofNfkbidin NOD mice also paradoxically results in enhanced thymic deletion of autoreactive CD8 AI4 T cells. However, transgenic elevation ofNfkbidexpression also increased the frequency and functional capacity of peripheral Tregs, in part contributing to the induction of complete T1D resistance. Thus, future identification of a pharmaceutical means to enhanceNfkbidexpression might ultimately provide an effective T1D intervention approach.Copyright © 2022 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc."

This phenomenon mediates, at least in part, the beneficial off-target effects of the BCG vaccine. Using an in vitro model of trained immunity, we show that BCG exposure induces a persistent change in active histone modifications, DNA methylation, transcription, and adenosine-to-inosine RNA modification in human monocytes. By profiling DNA methylation of circulating monocytes from infants in the MIS BAIR clinical trial, we identify a BCG-associated DNA methylation signature that persisted more than 12 months after neonatal BCG vaccination. Genes associated with this epigenetic signature are involved in viral response pathways, consistent with the reported off-target protection against viral infections in neonates, adults, and the elderly. Our findings indicate that the off-target effects of BCG in infants are accompanied by epigenetic remodeling of circulating monocytes that lasts more than 1 year."

"36028645","Epigenetics Beyond Fetal Growth Restriction: A Comprehensive Overview.","Mol Diagn Ther","Fetal growth restriction is a pathological condition occurring when the fetus does not reach the genetically determined growth potential. The etiology of fetal growth restriction is expected to be multifactorial and include fetal, maternal, and placental factors, the latter being the most frequent cause of isolated fetal growth restriction. Severe fetal growth restriction has been related to both an increased risk of perinatal morbidity and mortality, and also a greater susceptibility to developing diseases (especially cardio-metabolic and neurological disorders) later in life. In the last decade, emerging evidence has supported the hypothesis of the Developmental Origin of Health and Disease, which states that individual developmental 'programming' takes place via a delicate fine tuning of fetal genetic and epigenetic marks in response to a large variety of 'stressor' exposures during pregnancy. As the placenta is the maternal-fetal interface, it has a crucial role in fetal programming, such that any perturbation altering placental function interferes with both in-utero fetal growth and also with the adult life phenotype. Several epigenetic mechanisms have been highlighted in modulating the dynamic placental epigenome, including alterations in DNA methylation status, post-translational modification of histones, and non-coding RNAs. This review aims to provide a comprehensive and critical overview of the available literature on the epigenetic background of fetal growth restriction. A targeted research strategy was performed using PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and The Cochrane Library up to January 2022. A detailed and fully referenced synthesis of available literature following the Scale for the Assessment of Narrative Review Articles guidelines is provided. A variety of epigenetic marks predominantly interfering with placental development, function, and metabolism were found to be potentially associated with fetal growth restriction. Available evidence on the role of environmental exposures in shaping the placental epigenome and the fetal phenotype were also critically discussed. Because of the highly dynamic crosstalk between epigenetic mechanisms and the extra level of complexity in interpreting the final placental transcriptome, a full comprehension of these phenomenon is still lacking and advances in multi-omics approaches are urgently needed. Elucidating the role of epigenetics in the developmental origins of health and disease represents a new challenge for the coming years, with the goal of providing early interventions and prevention strategies and, hopefully, new treatment opportunities.© 2022.

"35942692","Banp regulates DNA damage response and chromosome segregation during the cell cycle in zebrafish retina.","Elife","Btg3-associated nuclear protein (Banp) was originally identified as a nuclear matrix-associated region (MAR)-binding protein and it functions as a tumor suppressor. At the molecular level, Banp regulates transcription of metabolic genes via a CGCG-containing motif called the Banp motif. However, its physiological roles in embryonic development are unknown. Here, we report that Banp is indispensable for the DNA damage response and chromosome segregation during mitosis. Zebrafishbanpmutants show mitotic cell accumulation and apoptosis in developing retina. We found that DNA replication stress and tp53-dependent DNA damage responses were activated to induce apoptosis inbanpmutants, suggesting that Banp is required for regulation of DNA replication and DNA damage repair. Furthermore, consistent with mitotic cell accumulation, chromosome segregation was not smoothly processed from prometaphase to anaphase inbanpmorphants, leading to a prolonged M-phase. Our RNA- and ATAC-sequencing identified 31 candidates for direct Banp target genes that carry the Banp motif. Interestingly, a DNA replication fork regulator,wrnip1,and two chromosome segregation regulators,cenptandncapg, are included in this list. Thus, Banp directly regulates transcription ofwrnip1for recovery from DNA replication stress, andcenptandncapgfor chromosome segregation during mitosis. Our findings provide the first in vivo evidence that Banp is required for cell-cycle progression and cell survival by regulating DNA damage responses and chromosome segregation during mitosis.© 2022, Babu et al."

We illustrate this challenge using the two most studied organisms:E. coli, with 34.6% genes lacking experimental evidence of function, andC. elegans, with identified proteins for approximately 50% of its genes. Another striking example is an artificial unicellular entity named JCVI-syn3.0, with a minimal set of genes. A total of 31.5% of the genes of JCVI-syn3.0 cannot be ascribed a specific biological function. The human interactome mapping project identified only 5-10% of all protein interactions in humans. In addition, most of the available data are static snapshots, and it is barely possible to generate realistic models of the dynamic processes within cells. Moreover, the existing interactomes reflect the de facto interaction but not its functional result, which is an unpredictable emerging property. Perhaps the completeness of molecular data on any living organism is beyond our reach and represents an unsolvable problem in biology."

Driven by high-throughput sequencing technologies, several promising deep learning methods have been proposed for fusing multi-omics data generated from a large number of samples.In this study, 16 representative deep learning methods are comprehensively evaluated on simulated, single-cell, and cancer multi-omics datasets. For each of the datasets, two tasks are designed: classification and clustering. The classification performance is evaluated by using three benchmarking metrics including accuracy, F1 macro, and F1 weighted. Meanwhile, the clustering performance is evaluated by using four benchmarking metrics including the Jaccard index (JI), C-index, silhouette score, and Davies Bouldin score. For the cancer multi-omics datasets, the methods' strength in capturing the association of multi-omics dimensionality reduction results with survival and clinical annotations is further evaluated. The benchmarking results indicate that moGAT achieves the best classification performance. Meanwhile, efmmdVAE, efVAE, and lfmmdVAE show the most promising performance across all complementary contexts in clustering tasks.Our benchmarking results not only provide a reference for biomedical researchers to choose appropriate deep learning-based multi-omics data fusion methods, but also suggest the future directions for the development of more effective multi-omics data fusion methods.

"35957682","Enhancing the diversity of self-replicating structures using active self-adapting mechanisms.","Front Genet","Numerous varieties of life forms have filled the earth throughout evolution. Evolution consists of two processes: self-replication and interaction with the physical environment and other living things around it. Initiated by von Neumann et al. studies on self-replication in cellular automata have attracted much attention, which aim to explore the logical mechanism underlying the replication of living things. In nature, competition is a common and spontaneous resource to drive self-replications, whereas most cellular-automaton-based models merely focus on some self-protection mechanisms that may deprive the rights of other artificial life (loops) to live. Especially, Huang et al. designed a self-adaptive, self-replicating model using a greedy selection mechanism, which can increase the ability of loops to survive through an occasionally abandoning part of their own structural information, for the sake of adapting to the restricted environment. Though this passive adaptation can improve diversity, it is always limited by the loop's original structure and is unable to evolve or mutate new genes in a way that is consistent with the adaptive evolution of natural life. Furthermore, it is essential to implement more complex self-adaptive evolutionary mechanisms not at the cost of increasing the complexity of cellular automata. To this end, this article proposes new self-adaptive mechanisms, which can change the information of structural genes and actively adapt to the environment when the arm of a self-replicating loop encounters obstacles, thereby increasing the chance of replication. Meanwhile, our mechanisms can also actively add a proper orientation to the current construction arm for the sake of breaking through the deadlock situation. Our new mechanisms enable active self-adaptations in comparison with the passive mechanism in the work of Huang et al. which is achieved by including a few rules without increasing the number of cell states as compared to the latter. Experiments demonstrate that this active self-adaptability can bring more diversity than the previous mechanism, whereby it may facilitate the emergence of various levels in self-replicating structures.Copyright © 2022 Xu, Wu, Peng, Lee, Xia and Kawasaki."
"35953478","Clonal diversification and histogenesis of malignant germ cell tumours.","Nat Commun","Germ cell tumours (GCTs) are a collection of benign and malignant neoplasms derived from primordial germ cells. They are uniquely able to recapitulate embryonic and extraembryonic tissues, which carries prognostic and therapeutic significance. The developmental pathways underpinning GCT initiation and histogenesis are incompletely understood. Here, we study the relationship of histogenesis and clonal diversification in GCTs by analysing the genomes and transcriptomes of 547 microdissected histological units. We find no correlation between genomic and histological heterogeneity. However, we identify unifying features including the retention of fetal developmental transcripts across tissues, expression changes on chromosome 12p, and a conserved somatic evolutionary sequence of whole genome duplication followed by clonal diversification. While this pattern is preserved across all GCTs, the developmental timing of the duplication varies between prepubertal and postpubertal cases. In addition, tumours of younger children exhibit distinct substitution signatures which may lend themselves as potential biomarkers for risk stratification. Our findings portray the extensive diversification of GCT tissues and genetic subclones as randomly distributed, while identifying overarching transcriptional and genomic features.© 2022. Crown."

In particular, studies of gene expression dynamics and regulation landscape in COVID-19 infected individuals are limited. Here, we report on a thorough analysis of whole blood RNA-seq data from 465 genotyped samples from the Japan COVID-19 Task Force, including 359 severe and 106 non-severe COVID-19 cases. We discover 1169 putative causal expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) including 34 possible colocalizations with biobank fine-mapping results of hematopoietic traits in a Japanese population, 1549 putative causal splice QTLs (sQTLs; e.g. two independent sQTLs at TOR1AIP1), as well as biologically interpretable trans-eQTL examples (e.g., REST and STING1), all fine-mapped at single variant resolution. We perform differential gene expression analysis to elucidate 198 genes with increased expression in severe COVID-19 cases and enriched for innate immune-related functions. Finally, we evaluate the limited but non-zero effect of COVID-19 phenotype on eQTL discovery, and highlight the presence of COVID-19 severity-interaction eQTLs (ieQTLs; e.g., CLEC4C and MYBL2).

The purpose of this study is to review and summarise the present evidence for artificial intelligence applications in the detection, classification and management of spinal metastasis, along with their potential integration into clinical practice. A systematic, detailed search of the main electronic medical databases was undertaken in concordance with the PRISMA guidelines. A total of 30 articles were retrieved from the database and reviewed. Key findings of current AI applications were compiled and summarised. The main clinical applications of AI techniques include image processing, diagnosis, decision support, treatment assistance and prognostic outcomes. In the realm of spinal oncology, artificial intelligence technologies have achieved relatively good performance and hold immense potential to aid clinicians, including enhancing work efficiency and reducing adverse events.

"36011003","Artificial Intelligence Predictive Models of Response to Cytotoxic Chemotherapy Alone or Combined to Targeted Therapy for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.","Cancers (Basel)","Tailored treatments for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) have not yet completely evolved due to the variety in response to drugs. Therefore, artificial intelligence has been recently used to develop prognostic and predictive models of treatment response (either activity/efficacy or toxicity) to aid in clinical decision making. In this systematic review, we have examined the ability of learning methods to predict response to chemotherapy alone or combined with targeted therapy in mCRC patients by targeting specific narrative publications in Medline up to April 2022 to identify appropriate original scientific articles. After the literature search, 26 original articles met inclusion and exclusion criteria and were included in the study. Our results show that all investigations conducted on this field have provided generally promising results in predicting the response to therapy or toxic side-effects. By a meta-analytic approach we found that the overall weighted means of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) were 0.90, 95% C.I. 0.80-0.95 and 0.83, 95% C.I. 0.74-0.89 in training and validation sets, respectively, indicating a good classification performance in discriminating response vs. non-response. The calculation of overall HR indicates that learning models have strong ability to predict improved survival. Lastly, the delta-radiomics and the 74 gene signatures were able to discriminate response vs. non-response by correctly identifying up to 99% of mCRC patients who were responders and up to 100% of patients who were non-responders. Specifically, when we evaluated the predictive models with tests reaching 80% sensitivity (SE) and 90% specificity (SP), the delta radiomics showed an SE of 99% and an SP of 94% in the training set and an SE of 85% and SP of 92 in the test set, whereas for the 74 gene signatures the SE was 97.6% and the SP 100% in the training set."
"35933478","Developing machine learning algorithms for dynamic estimation of progression during active surveillance for prostate cancer.","NPJ Digit Med","Active Surveillance (AS) for prostate cancer is a management option that continually monitors early disease and considers intervention if progression occurs. A robust method to incorporate ""live"" updates of progression risk during follow-up has hitherto been lacking. To address this, we developed a deep learning-based individualised longitudinal survival model using Dynamic-DeepHit-Lite (DDHL) that learns data-driven distribution of time-to-event outcomes. Further refining outputs, we used a reinforcement learning approach (Actor-Critic) for temporal predictive clustering (AC-TPC) to discover groups with similar time-to-event outcomes to support clinical utility. We applied these methods to data from 585 men on AS with longitudinal and comprehensive follow-up (median 4.4 years). Time-dependent C-indices and Brier scores were calculated and compared to Cox regression and landmarking methods. Both Cox and DDHL models including only baseline variables showed comparable C-indices but the DDHL model performance improved with additional follow-up data. With 3 years of data collection and 3 years follow-up the DDHL model had a C-index of 0.79 (±0.11) compared to 0.70 (±0.15) for landmarking Cox and 0.67 (±0.09) for baseline Cox only. Model calibration was good across all models tested. The AC-TPC method further discovered 4 distinct outcome-related temporal clusters with distinct progression trajectories. Those in the lowest risk cluster had negligible progression risk while those in the highest cluster had a 50% risk of progression by 5 years. In summary, we report a novel machine learning approach to inform personalised follow-up during active surveillance which improves predictive power with increasing data input over time.© 2022.

"35785523","Interpretable Machine Learning Models to Predict the Resistance of Breast Cancer Patients to Doxorubicin from Their microRNA Profiles.","Adv Sci (Weinh)","Doxorubicin is a common treatment for breast cancer. However, not all patients respond to this drug, which sometimes causes life-threatening side effects. Accurately anticipating doxorubicin-resistant patients would therefore permit to spare them this risk while considering alternative treatments without delay. Stratifying patients based on molecular markers in their pretreatment tumors is a promising approach to advance toward this ambitious goal, but single-gene gene markers such as HER2 expression have not shown to be sufficiently predictive. The recent availability of matched doxorubicin-response and diverse molecular profiles across breast cancer patients permits now analysis at a much larger scale. 16 machine learning algorithms and 8 molecular profiles are systematically evaluated on the same cohort of patients. Only 2 of the 128 resulting models are substantially predictive, showing that they can be easily missed by a standard-scale analysis. The best model is classification and regression tree (CART) nonlinearly combining 4 selected miRNA isoforms to predict doxorubicin response (median Matthew correlation coefficient (MCC) and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.56 and 0.80, respectively). By contrast, HER2 expression is significantly less predictive (median MCC and AUC of 0.14 and 0.57, respectively). As the predictive accuracy of this CART model increases with larger training sets, its update with future data should result in even better accuracy.© 2022 The Authors.

"35974024","The power, potential, benefits, and challenges of implementing high-throughput sequencing in food safety systems.","NPJ Sci Food","The development and application of modern sequencing technologies have led to many new improvements in food safety and public health. With unprecedented resolution and big data, high-throughput sequencing (HTS) has enabled food safety specialists to sequence marker genes, whole genomes, and transcriptomes of microorganisms almost in real-time. These data reveal not only the identity of a pathogen or an organism of interest in the food supply but its virulence potential and functional characteristics. HTS of amplicons, allow better characterization of the microbial communities associated with food and the environment. New and powerful bioinformatics tools, algorithms, and machine learning allow for development of new models to predict and tackle important events such as foodborne disease outbreaks. Despite its potential, the integration of HTS into current food safety systems is far from complete. Government agencies have embraced this new technology, and use it for disease diagnostics, food safety inspections, and outbreak investigations. However, adoption and application of HTS by the food industry have been comparatively slow, sporadic, and fragmented. Incorporation of HTS by food manufacturers in their food safety programs could reinforce the design and verification of effectiveness of control measures by providing greater insight into the characteristics, origin, relatedness, and evolution of microorganisms in our foods and environment. Here, we discuss this new technology, its power, and potential. A brief history of implementation by public health agencies is presented, as are the benefits and challenges for the food industry, and its future in the context of food safety.© 2022.

While associated with an enhanced risk of adverse outcomes such as hospitalization, disability and death following infection, its role in perceived age-related declines in vaccine responses has yet to be fully elucidated. Using data and biosamples from a 4-year clinical trial comparing immune responses of standard- and high-dose influenza vaccination, we quantified biological age (BA) prior to vaccination in adults over 65 years old (n = 292) using a panel of ten serological biomarkers (albumin, alanine aminotransferase, creatinine, ferritin, free thyroxine, cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, tumour necrosis factor, interleukin-6) as implemented in the BioAge R package. Hemagglutination inhibition antibody titres against influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B were quantified prior to vaccination and 4-, 10- and 20- weeks post-vaccination.Counter to our hypothesis, advanced BA was associated with improved post-vaccination antibody titres against the different viral types and subtypes. However, this was dependent on both vaccine dose and CMV serostatus, as associations were only apparent for high-dose recipients (d = 0.16-0.26), and were largely diminished for CMV positive high-dose recipients.These findings emphasize two important points: first, the loss of physiological integrity related to biological aging may not be a ubiquitous driver of immune decline in older adults; and second, latent factors such as CMV infection (prevalent in up to 90% of older adults worldwide) may contribute to the heterogeneity in vaccine responses of older adults more than previously thought.© 2022.

"36011382","Epigenetic Alterations in Sports-Related Injuries.","Genes (Basel)","It is a well-known fact that physical activity benefits people of all age groups. However, highly intensive training, maladaptation, improper equipment, and lack of sufficient rest lead to contusions and sports-related injuries. From the perspectives of sports professionals and those performing regular-amateur sports activities, it is important to maintain proper levels of training, without encountering frequent injuries. The bodily responses to physical stress and intensive physical activity are detected on many levels. Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, histone protein methylation, acetylation, and miRNA expression occur in response to environmental changes and play fundamental roles in the regulation of cellular activities. In the current review, we summarise the available knowledge on epigenetic alterations present in tissues and organs (e.g., muscles, the brain, tendons, and bones) as a consequence of sports-related injuries. Epigenetic mechanism observations have the potential to become useful tools in sports medicine, as predictors of approaching pathophysiological alterations and injury biomarkers that have already taken place."
"35953530","Genetic overlap between mood instability and alcohol-related phenotypes suggests shared biological underpinnings.","Neuropsychopharmacology","Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a pervasive and devastating mental illness with high comorbidity rates with other mental disorders. Understanding the genetic architecture of this comorbidity could be improved by focusing on intermediate traits that show positive genetic correlation with the disorders. Thus, we aimed to characterize the shared vs. unique polygenicity of AUD, alcohol consumption (AC) and mood instability (MOOD) -beyond genetic correlation, and boost discovery for jointly-associated loci. Summary statistics for MOOD (a binary measure of the tendency to report frequent mood swings), AC (number of standard drinks over a typical consumption week) and AUD GWASs (Ns > 200,000) were analyzed to characterize the cross-phenotype associations between MOOD and AC, MOOD and AUD and AC and AUD. To do so, we used a newly established pipeline that combines (i) the bivariate causal mixture model (MiXeR) to quantify polygenic overlap and (ii) the conjunctional false discovery rate (conjFDR) to discover specific jointly associated genomic loci, which were mapped to genes and biological functions. MOOD was highly polygenic (10.4k single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs, SD = 2k) compared to AC (4.9k SNPs, SD = 0.6k) and AUD (4.3k SNPs, SD = 2k). The polygenic overlap of MOOD and AC was twice that of MOOD and AUD (98% vs. 49%), with opposite genetic correlation (-0.2 vs. 0.23), as confirmed in independent samples. MOOD&AUD associated SNPs were significantly enriched for brain genes, conversely to MOOD&AC. Among 38 jointly associated loci, fifteen were novel for MOOD, AC and AUD. MOOD, AC and AUD were also strongly associated at the phenotypic level. Overall, using multilevel polygenic quantification, joint loci discovery and functional annotation methods, we evidenced that the polygenic overlap between MOOD and AC/AUD implicated partly shared biological underpinnings, yet, clearly distinct functional patterns between MOOD&AC and MOOD&AUD, suggesting new mechanisms for the comorbidity of AUD with mood disorders.© 2022.

We also highlight how these differentially methylated sites overlap with other regulatory epigenetic marks and MS risk variants. Lastly, we employ luciferase assays to assess the functionality of these regions, showing that the loss of methylation leads to an increase in ATXN1 expression.Altogether, these findings provide biological insights into ataxin-1 regulation in the immune system as well as into the molecular mechanisms underlying MS risk.© 2022 The Authors.

The relative abundance of genes pertinent to specific pathways is measured through statistical methods, and associated functional pathways are retrieved from online bioinformatics databases. In the last decade, along with the spread of the internet, higher availability of computational resources made PEA software tools easy to access and to use for bioinformatics practitioners worldwide. Although it became easier to use these tools, it also became easier to make mistakes that could generate inflated or misleading results, especially for beginners and inexperienced computational biologists. With this article, we propose nine quick tips to avoid common mistakes and to out a complete, sound, thorough PEA, which can produce relevant and robust results. We describe our nine guidelines in a simple way, so that they can be understood and used by anyone, including students and beginners. Some tips explain what to do before starting a PEA, others are suggestions of how to correctly generate meaningful results, and some final guidelines indicate some useful steps to properly interpret PEA results.

We assessed whether ML provided added value over logistic regression for prediction of schizophrenia, and compared models built using polygenic risk scores (PRS) or clinical/demographic factors. LASSO and ridge-penalised logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), random forests, boosting, neural networks and stacked models were trained to predict schizophrenia, using PRS for schizophrenia (PRSSZ), sex, parental depression, educational attainment, winter birth, handedness and number of siblings as predictors. Models were evaluated for discrimination using area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC) and relative importance of predictors using permutation feature importance (PFI). In a secondary analysis, fitted models were tested for association with schizophrenia-related traits which had not been used in model development. Following learning curve analysis, 738 cases and 3690 randomly sampled controls were selected from the UK Biobank. ML models combining all predictors showed the highest discrimination (linear SVM, AUROC = 0.71), but did not significantly outperform logistic regression. AUROC was robust over 100 random resamples of controls. PFI identified PRSSZas the most important predictor. Highest variance in fitted models was explained by schizophrenia-related traits including fluid intelligence (most associated: linear SVM), digit symbol substitution (RBF SVM), BMI (XGBoost), smoking status (XGBoost) and deprivation (linear SVM). In conclusion, ML approaches did not provide substantial added value for prediction of schizophrenia over logistic regression, as indexed by AUROC; however, risk scores derived with different ML approaches differ with respect to association with schizophrenia-related traits.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

The molecular drivers of HF are still largely unknown.We aimed to identify circulating proteins causally associated with HF by leveraging genome-wide genetic association data for HF including 47,309 cases and 930,014 controls. We performed two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) with multiple cis instruments as well as network and enrichment analysis using data from blood protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) (2,965 blood proteins) measured in 3,301 individuals. Nineteen blood proteins were causally associated with HF, were not subject to reverse causality and were enriched in ligand-receptor and glycosylation molecules. Network pathway analysis of the blood proteins showed enrichment in NF-kappa B, TGF beta, lipid in atherosclerosis and fluid shear stress. Cross-phenotype analysis of HF identified genetic overlap with cardiovascular drugs, myocardial infarction, parental longevity and low-density cholesterol. Multi-trait MR identified causal associations between HF-associated blood proteins and cardiovascular outcomes. Multivariable MR showed that association of BAG3, MIF and APOA5 with HF were mediated by the blood pressure and coronary artery disease. According to the directional effect and biological action, 7 blood proteins are targets of existing drugs or are tractable for the development of novel therapeutics. Among the pathways, sialyl Lewis x and the activin type II receptor are potential druggable candidates.Integrative MR analyses of the blood proteins identified causally-associated proteins with HF and revealed pleiotropy of the blood proteome with cardiovascular risk factors.

"35991551","DNA methylation patterns and gene expression from amygdala tissue of mature Brahman cows exposed to prenatal stress.","Front Genet","Prenatal stress can alter postnatal performance and temperament of cattle. These phenotypic effects may result from changes in gene expression caused by stress-induced epigenetic alterations. Specifically, shifts in gene expression caused by DNA methylation within the brain's amygdala can result in altered behavior because it regulates fear, stress response and aggression in mammals Thus, the objective of this experiment was to identify DNA methylation and gene expression differences in the amygdala tissue of 5-year-old prenatally stressed (PNS) Brahman cows compared to control cows. Pregnant Brahman cows (n= 48) were transported for 2-h periods at 60 ± 5, 80 ± 5, 100 ± 5, 120 ± 5, and 140 ± 5 days of gestation. A non-transported group (n= 48) were controls (Control). Amygdala tissue was harvested from 6 PNS and 8 Control cows at 5 years of age. Overall methylation of gene body regions, promoter regions, and cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) islands were compared between the two groups. In total, 202 genes, 134 promoter regions, and 133 CpG islands exhibited differential methylation (FDR ≤ 0.15). Following comparison of gene expression in the amygdala between the PNS and Control cows, 2 differentially expressed genes were identified (FDR ≤ 0.15). The minimal differences observed could be the result of natural changes of DNA methylation and gene expression as an animal ages, or because this degree of transportation stress was not severe enough to cause lasting effects on the offspring. A younger age may be a more appropriate time to assess methylation and gene expression differences produced by prenatal stress.Copyright © 2022 Baker, Earnhardt, Cilkiz, Collins, Littlejohn, Cardoso, Ghaffari, Long, Riggs, Randel, Welsh and Riley."

DNA methylation data from Infinium HM450 and mRNA Illumina sequencing of n = 33 DCM and n = 24 control probands were filtered, analyzed and used as input for matrix factorization using R NMF package. Mann-Whitney U test showed 4 out of 5 latent factors are significantly different between DCM and control probands (P<0.05). Characterization of top 10% features driving each latent factor showed a significant enrichment of biological processes known to be involved in DCM pathogenesis, including immune response (P = 3.97E-21), nucleic acid binding (P = 1.42E-18), extracellular matrix (P = 9.23E-14) and myofibrillar structure (P = 8.46E-12).

We leveraged the dTAG PROTAC degradation platform to acutely deplete BCL11A protein in erythroid cells and examined consequences by nascent transcriptomics, proteomics, chromatin accessibility, and histone profiling. Among 31 genes repressed by BCL11A, HBG1/2 and HBZ show the most abundant and progressive changes in transcription and chromatin accessibility upon BCL11A loss. Transcriptional changes at HBG1/2 were detected in <2 h. Robust HBG1/2 reactivation upon acute BCL11A depletion occurred without the loss of promoter 5-methylcytosine (5mC). Using targeted protein degradation, we establish a hierarchy of gene reactivation at BCL11A targets, in which nascent transcription is followed by increased chromatin accessibility, and both are uncoupled from promoter DNA methylation at the HBG1/2 loci.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

"36034597","Phenotype clustering in health care: A narrative review for clinicians.","Front Artif Intell","Human pathophysiology is occasionally too complex for unaided hypothetical-deductive reasoning and the isolated application of additive or linear statistical methods. Clustering algorithms use input data patterns and distributions to form groups of similar patients or diseases that share distinct properties. Although clinicians frequently perform tasks that may be enhanced by clustering, few receive formal training and clinician-centered literature in clustering is sparse. To add value to clinical care and research, optimal clustering practices require a thorough understanding of how to process and optimize data, select features, weigh strengths and weaknesses of different clustering methods, select the optimal clustering method, and apply clustering methods to solve problems. These concepts and our suggestions for implementing them are described in this narrative review of published literature. All clustering methods share the weakness of finding potential clusters even when natural clusters do not exist, underscoring the importance of applying data-driven techniques as well as clinical and statistical expertise to clustering analyses. When applied properly, patient and disease phenotype clustering can reveal obscured associations that can help clinicians understand disease pathophysiology, predict treatment response, and identify patients for clinical trial enrollment.Copyright © 2022 Loftus, Shickel, Balch, Tighe, Abbott, Fazzone, Anderson, Rozowsky, Ozrazgat-Baslanti, Ren, Berceli, Hogan, Efron, Moorman, Rashidi, Upchurch and Bihorac."
"35937815","Environmental Triggering of Type 1 Diabetes Autoimmunity.","Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)","Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic autoimmune disease in which pancreatic islet β cells are destroyed by immune cells, ultimately leading to overt diabetes. The progressive increase in T1D incidence over the years points to the role of environmental factors in triggering or accelerating the disease process which develops on a highly multigenic susceptibility background. Evidence that environmental factors induce T1D has mostly been obtained in animal models. In the human, associations between viruses, dietary habits or changes in the microbiota and the development of islet cell autoantibodies or overt diabetes have been reported. So far, prediction of T1D development is mostly based on autoantibody detection. Future work should focus on identifying a causality between the different environmental risk factors and T1D development to improve prediction scores. This should allow developing preventive strategies to limit the T1D burden in the future.Copyright © 2022 Houeiss, Luce and Boitard."

Due to the lack of a good CRC screening program, most of the CRC patients are being transferred at the time of treatment. The conventional treatment cannot effectively improve the prognosis of CRC patients, and the target drugs can significantly prolong the overall survival of patients in the advanced stage. However, the use of single drug may lead to acquired drug resistance and various serious complications. Therefore, combined targeted drug therapy is the main alternative treatment with poor effect of single targeted drug therapy, which has important research significance for the treatment of CRC. Therefore, this study intends to culture CRC cell linesin vitroat the cell level and intervene with the GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide. The effects of liraglutide on the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signal pathway and CRC cell proliferation, cycle, migration, invasion, and apoptosis are explored by detecting cell proliferation, cycle, migration, invasion, and apoptosis and the expression of related mRNA and protein. The results showed that liraglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, could block the CRC cell cycle, reduce cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and promote apoptosis by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signal pathway.Copyright © 2022 Tong, Peng, Chen, Sha, Dai, Xiang, Zou, He and Wang."

Imminent risk of suicide was coded for when callers affirmed intent, plan, and the availability of means; level of risk was assessed by the responding counsellor and reassessed by a team of clinical researchers using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (=5/6). Low risk of suicide was coded for in an absence of intent, plan, and means and via Columbia suicide Severity Scale Ratings (=1/2). Preprocessing involved normalization and pre-emphasis of voice signals, while voice biometrics were extracted using the statistical language r. Candidate predictors were identified using Lasso regression. Each voice biomarker was assessed as a predictor of suicide risk using a generalized additive mixed effects model with splines to account for nonlinearity. Finally, a component-wise gradient boosting model was used to classify each call recording based on precoded suicide risk ratings.A total of 77 imminent-risk calls were compared with 204 low-risk calls. Moreover, 36 voice biomarkers were extracted from each speech frame. Caller sex was a significant moderating factor (β=-.84, 95% CI -0.85, -0.84; t=6.59, P<.001). Candidate biomarkers were reduced to 11 primary markers, with distinct models developed for men and women. Using leave-one-out cross-validation, ensuring that the speech frames of no single caller featured in both training and test data sets simultaneously, an area under the precision or recall curve of 0.985 was achieved (95% CI 0.97, 1.0). The gamboost classification model correctly classified 469,332/470,032 (99.85%) speech frames.This study demonstrates an objective, efficient, and economical assessment of imminent suicide risk in an ecologically valid setting with potential applications to real-time assessment and response.Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12622000486729; https://www.anzctr.org.au/ACTRN12622000486729.aspx.©Ravi Iyer, Maja Nedeljkovic, Denny Meyer.

CRISPR-based diagnosis has been regarded as a next-generation detection method; however, it has some limitations, such as the need for specific recognition sequences and multiple enzymes for multiplex detection. Therefore, research on the exploration and development of novel nucleases helps to promote specific and sensitive diagnoses. Prokaryotic Argonaute (Ago) proteins exert directed nuclease activity that can target any sequence. Recently, thermophilic Agos have been developed as new detection techniques achieving multiplexity for multiple targets using a single enzyme, as well as accurate recognition of single-base differential sequences. In this study, to overcome the requirement for high reaction temperature of thermophilic Ago-based methods, we expanded the mining of mesophilic Agos to achieve CRISPR-like isothermal detection, named mesophilic Ago-based isothermal detection method (MAIDEN). The principle of MAIDEN uses mesophilic Ago cleavage combined with reverse transcription, which can provide single-strand DNA as a substrate and allow cleavage of fluorescence probes to sense SARS-CoV-2 at moderate temperature. We first mined and optimized the mesophilic Ago and the fluorescence reporter system and then selected a compatible reverse transcription reaction. Furthermore, we optimized MAIDEN into a one-step reaction that can detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA at the nanomolar concentration at a constant temperature of 42°C within 60 min. Therefore, MAIDEN shows advantageous portability and easy-to-implement operation, avoiding the possibility of open-lid contamination. Our study was the first attempt to demonstrate that mesophilic Agos can be harnessed as diagnostic tools, and MAIDEN was easily extended to detect other pathogens in a rapid and efficient manner.Copyright © 2022 Li, Dong, Guo, Huang, Xu, Li, Yang, Yao, Feng and Liu."

However, whether ED still has certain advantages over esophagectomy in terms of long-term survival remains unclear.The aim of this meta-analysis was to compare the long-term outcomes of ED and surgery in the treatment of cT1N0 esophageal cancer.Several electronic databases including the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases were searched up to April 7, 2022 for studies which compared the overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) of cT1N0 esophageal cancer patients receiving the ED or esophagectomy. The hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were combined and all statistical analysis was conducted through STATA 15.0 software.A total of 12 studies involving 3,732 patients were enrolled. No significant difference in the OS between ED and surgery groups was observed (HR = 0.78, 95% CI, 0.59-1.04,p = 0.089). However, the DSS of the ED group was significantly longer than that of the surgery group (HR = 0.56, 95% CI, 0.39-0.82,p = 0.003).In overall, the current evidence manifested that the long-term survival of cT1N0 esophageal cancer patients undergoing ED was not worse than that of patients undergoing esophagectomy.

"36013279","Selecting Genetic Variants and Interactions Associated with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A Group LASSO Approach.","J Pers Med","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a multi-system neurodegenerative disease that affects both upper and lower motor neurons, resulting from a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Usually, the association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and this disease is tested individually, which leads to the testing of multiple hypotheses. In addition, this classical approach does not support the detection of interaction-dependent SNPs. We applied a two-step procedure to select SNPs and pairwise interactions associated with ALS. SNP data from 276 ALS patients and 268 controls were analyzed by a two-step group LASSO in 2000 iterations. In the first step, we fitted a group LASSO model to a bootstrap sample and a random subset of predictors (25%) from the original data set aiming to screen for important SNPs and, in the second step, we fitted a hierarchical group LASSO model to evaluate pairwise interactions. An in silico analysis was performed on a set of variables, which were prioritized according to their bootstrap selection frequency. We identified seven SNPs (rs16984239,rs10459680,rs1436918,rs1037666,rs4552942,rs10773543, andrs2241493) and two pairwise interactions (rs16984239:rs2118657andrs16984239:rs3172469) potentially involved in nervous system conservation and function.

ALS is a highly heterogeneous disease, whereby patients present with vastly different phenotypes. Despite this heterogeneity, over 97% of patients will exhibit pathological TAR-DNA binding protein-43 (TDP-43) cytoplasmic inclusions. TDP-43 is a ubiquitously expressed RNA binding protein with the capacity to bind over 6000 RNA and DNA targets-particularly those involved in RNA, mitochondrial, and lipid metabolism. Here, we review the unique structure and function of TDP-43 and its role in affecting the aforementioned metabolic processes in ALS. Considering evidence published specifically in TDP-43-relevant in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo models we posit that TDP-43 acts in a positive feedback loop with mRNA transcription/translation, stress granules, cytoplasmic aggregates, and mitochondrial proteins causing a relentless cycle of disease-like pathology eventuating in neuronal toxicity. Given its undeniable presence in ALS pathology, TDP-43 presents as a promising target for mechanistic disease modelling and future therapeutic investigations."

Here, we present our analyses of the male and female mouse amygdala transcriptome and epitranscriptome, obtained using parallel Illumina RNA-seq and Oxford Nanopore dRNA-seq, associated with the acquisition of PTSD-like fear induced by Pavlovian cued-fear conditioning. We report significant sex-specific differences in the amygdala transcriptional response during fear acquisition and a range of shared and dimorphic epitranscriptomic signatures. Differential RNA modifications are enriched among mRNA transcripts associated with neurotransmitter regulation and mitochondrial function, many of which have been previously implicated in PTSD. Very few differentially modified transcripts are also differentially expressed, suggesting an influential, expression-independent role for epitranscriptional regulation in PTSD-like fear acquisition.© 2022 The Author(s)."

However, less is known about the key events occurring inside the nucleus in the process of aging. The advent of chromosome capture techniques and extensive modern sequencing technologies have illuminated a rather dynamic structure of chromatin inside the nucleus. As cells advance along their life cycle, chromatin condensation states alter which leads to a different epigenetic landscape, correlated with modified gene expression. The exact factors mediating these changes in the chromatin structure and function remain elusive in the context of aging cells. The accumulation of DNA damage, reactive oxygen species and loss of genomic integrity as cells cease to divide can contribute to a tumor stimulating environment.

Processing, connecting, storing, and ordering extensive parts of these individual data requires Big Data techniques. Whereas novel technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning have exciting application for the augmentation of laboratory medicine, the Big Data concept remains fundamental for any sophisticated data analysis in large databases. To make laboratory medicine data optimally usable for clinical and research purposes, they need to be FAIR: findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. This can be achieved, for example, by automated recording, connection of devices, efficient ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, careful data governance, and modern data security solutions. Enriched with clinical data, laboratory medicine data allow a gain in pathophysiological insights, can improve patient care, or can be used to develop reference intervals for diagnostic purposes. Nevertheless, Big Data in laboratory medicine do not come without challenges: the growing number of analyses and data derived from them is a demanding task to be taken care of.

The diagnostic yield of ES has been estimated to be between 25-40% and may be higher in specific clinical scenarios. Those who remain undiagnosed may have no molecular findings of interest on ES, variants of uncertain significance in genes that are linked to human disease, or variants of uncertain significance in candidate genes that are not definitively tied to human disease. Recent evidence suggests that a post-exome evaluation consisting of clinical re-phenotyping, functional studies of candidate variants in known genes, and variant reevaluation can lead to a diagnosis in 5-15% of additional cases. In this brief research study, we present our experience on post-exome evaluations in a cohort of patients who are believed to have a genetic etiology for their symptoms. We have reached a full or partial diagnosis in approximately 18% (6/33) of cases that have completed evaluations to date. We accomplished this by utilizing NGS-based methods that are available on a clinical basis. A sample of these cases highlights the utility of ES reanalysis with updated phenotyping allowing for the discovery of new genes, re-adjudication of known variants, incorporating updated phenotypic information, utilizing functional testing such as targeted RNA sequencing, and deploying other NGS-based testing methods such as gene panels and genome sequencing to reach a diagnosis.Copyright © 2022 Baker, Ulm, Belonis, Brightman, Hallinan, Leslie, Miethke, Vawter-Lee, Wu and Pena."

It is a key contributor to heterogeneity, chemoresistance, and metastasis in many carcinoma types, where the intermediate EMT state plays a critical tumor-initiating role. We isolate multiple distinct single-cell clones from the SUM149PT human breast cell line spanning the EMT spectrum having diverse migratory, tumor-initiating, and metastatic qualities, including three unique intermediates. Using a multiomics approach, we identify CBFβ as a key regulator of metastatic ability in the intermediate state. To quantify epithelial-mesenchymal heterogeneity within tumors, we develop an advanced multiplexed immunostaining approach using SUM149-derived orthotopic tumors and find that the EMT state and epithelial-mesenchymal heterogeneity are predictive of overall survival in a cohort of stage III breast cancer.

Aberrant signaling plays a major role in the pathophysiology of many diseases. Recent studies have unraveled the superfamily of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) as critical signaling nodes in diverse signaling networks. Defective signaling by lncRNAs is emerging as a causative factor underlying the pathophysiology of many diseases. LncRNAs have been shown to be involved in the multiplexed regulation of diverse pathways through both genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. They can serve as decoys, guides, scaffolds, and effector molecules to regulate cell signaling. In comparison with the other classes of RNAs, lncRNAs possess unique structural modifications that contribute to their diversity in modes of action within the nucleus and cytoplasm. In this review, we summarize the structure and function of lncRNAs as well as their vivid mechanisms of action. Further, we provide insights into the role of lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of four major disease paradigms, namely cardiovascular diseases, neurological disorders, cancers, and the metabolic disease, diabetes mellitus. This review serves as a succinct treatise that could open windows to investigate the role of lncRNAs as novel therapeutic targets."

Accumulating evidence indicates that non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) participate in NSCLC disease progression, but the link between PD and the ncRNAs in NSCLC is poorly elucidated. Here, we used whole transcriptome sequencing to systematically investigate the RNAs-associated regulatory network in the PD treating NSCLC cell lines. A total of 942 significantly dysregulated RNAs were obtained. Among those, five circRNAs and six IncRNAs were rigorously selected via database and in vitro validation. In addition, the functional enrichment study of differentially expressed mRNAs, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within PD-related mRNA structures, and the interaction between PD and mRNA-related proteins were analyzed through gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), structural variant analysis, and molecular docking, respectively. With further in vitro validation, the results show that PD inhibits cell proliferation, arrests the cell cycle, and induces cell apoptosis through targeting BCL2-related proteins.
