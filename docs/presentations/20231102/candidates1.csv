,37907649,An integrative analysis reveals the prognostic value and potential functions of MTMR2 in hepatocellular carcinoma.,Sci Rep,"Abnormal expression of myotubularin-related protein 2 (MTMR2) has been identified in certain types of cancer, leading to varying effects on tumor genesis and progression. However, the various biological significances of MTMR2 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have not been systematically and comprehensively studied. The aim of this study was to explore the role of MTMR2 in HCC. We obtained the raw data from Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. Afterward, we analyzed the data using R and cBioPortal. We investigated the connection between MTMR2 and its expression, prognosis, clinical significance, methylation, genetic alterations, tumor microenvironment (TME), tumor mutation burden (TMB), and drug reactivity in HCC patients. MTMR2 expression levels in HCC cells were validated through western blotting and RT-qPCR. MTMR2 exhibits high levels of expression across a wide range of cancer types, including HCC. MTMR2 is diagnostically valuable in detecting HCC, with its up-regulated expression often being indicative of poor prognosis among HCC patients. The in vitro experiments confirmed elevated MTMR2 expression in HepG2, HUH-7, and MHCC-97H cells. Univariate and multivariate Cox analysis demonstrated that MTMR2 was an independent prognostic factor in HCC patients. The cg20195272 site has the highest degree of methylation in MTMR2, and it is positively correlated with MTMR2 expression. Patients with high levels of methylation at the cg20195272 site show poor prognosis. Analysis of the TME indicates that high expression of MTMR2 is associated with elevated ESTIMATE score and that MTMR2 expression correlates positively with infiltration by resting memory CD4 T cells, activated dendritic cells, as well as several immune checkpoints. There is a negative correlation between MTMR2 expression and TMB, and drug sensitivity analyses have shown that higher MTMR2 expression is associated with lower IC50 values. This study indicates that increased expression of MTMR2 may play a crucial role in the occurrence, progression, diagnosis, prognostic prediction and drug therapy of HCC.© 2023. The Author(s)."
,37906571,"DNA methylation alterations of ADCY5, MICAL2 and PLEKHG2 during the developmental stage of cryptogenic hepatocellular carcinoma.",Hepatol Res,"The aim of this study was to clarify the significance of DNA methylation alterations of cryptogenic hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs).Using the Infinium assay, we performed genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of 250 liver tissue samples, including non-cancerous liver tissue (U-N) and corresponding cancerous tissue (U-T) from patients with cryptogenic HCC without a history of excessive alcohol use and hepatitis virus infection, and whose U-N samples showed no remarkable histological features (no microscopic evidence of simple steatosis, any form of hepatitis including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [NASH], or liver cirrhosis).We identified 3,272 probes that showed significant differences of DNA methylation levels between U-N and normal liver tissue samples from patients without HCC, indicating that a distinct DNA methylation profile had already been established at the precancerous U-N stage. U-Ns have a DNA methylation profile differing from that of non-cancerous liver tissue of patients with NASH-related, viral hepatitis-related, and alcoholic liver disease-related HCCs. Such DNA methylation alterations in U-Ns were inherited by U-Ts. The U-Ns showed DNA methylation alteration of ADCY5 resulting in alteration of its mRNA expression, whereas non-cancerous liver tissue of patients with NASH-, viral hepatitis-, or alcoholic liver disease-related HCCs did not. DNA methylation levels of MICAL2 and PLEKHG2 in U-Ts were correlated with larger tumor diameter and portal vein involvement, respectively.U-N-specific DNA hypermethylation of ADCY5 may have significance even from the precancerous stage in liver showing no remarkable histological features. DNA hypomethylation of MICAL2 and PLEKHG2 may determine the clinicopathological features of cryptogenic HCC. This article is protected by copyright.

,37905045,"Systematic perturbations of SETD2, NSD1, NSD2, NSD3 and ASH1L reveals their distinct contributions to H3K36 methylation.",bioRxiv,"Methylation of histone 3 lysine 36 (H3K36me) has emerged as an essential epigenetic component for the faithful regulation of gene expression. Despite its importance in development, disease, and cancer, how the molecular agents collectively shape the H3K36me landscape is unclear.We use a mouse mesenchymal stem cell model to perturb the H3K36me deposition machinery and infer the activities of the five most prominent players: SETD2, NSD1, NSD2, NSD3, and ASH1L. We find that H3K36me2 is the most abundant of the three methylation states and is predominantly deposited at intergenic regions by NSD1, and partly by NSD2. In contrast, H3K36me1/3 are most abundant within exons and are positively correlated with gene expression. We demonstrate that while SETD2 deposits most H3K36me3, it also deposits H3K36me2 within transcribed genes. Additionally, loss of SETD2 results in an increase of exonic H3K36me1, suggesting other H3K36 methyltransferases (K36MTs) prime gene bodies with lower methylation states ahead of transcription. Through a reductive approach, we uncover the distribution patterns of NSD3- and ASH1L-catalyzed H3K36me2. While NSD1/2 establish broad intergenic H3K36me2 domains, NSD3 deposits H3K36me2 peaks on active promoters and enhancers. Meanwhile, the activity of ASH1L is restricted to the regulatory elements of developmentally relevant genes, and our analyses implicate PBX2 as a potential recruitment factor.Within genes, SETD2 deposits both H3K36me2/3, while the other K36MTs are capable of depositing H3K36me1/2 independently of SETD2 activity. For the deposition of H3K36me1/2, we find a hierarchy of K36MT activities where NSD1>NSD2>NSD3>ASH1L. While NSD1 and NSD2 are responsible for most genome-wide propagation of H3K36me2, the activities of NSD3 and ASH1L are confined to active regulatory elements."
,37904501,NA,NA,"ConspectusDNA is the genetic matter of life composed of four major nucleotides which can be further furnished with biologically important covalent modifications. Among the variety of enzymes involved in DNA metabolism, AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases (MTases) combine the recognition of specific sequences and covalent methylation of a target nucleotide. The naturally transferred methyl groups play important roles in biological signaling, but they are poor physical reporters and largely resistant to chemical derivatization. Therefore, an obvious strategy to unlock the practical utility of the methyltransferase reactions is to enable the transfer of ""prederivatized"" (extended) versions of the methyl group.However, previous enzymatic studies of extended AdoMet analogs indicated that the transalkylation reactions are drastically impaired as the size of the carbon chain increases. In collaborative efforts, we proposed that, akin to enhanced SN2 reactivity of allylic and propargylic systems, addition of a π orbital next to the transferable carbon atom might confer the needed activation of the reaction. Indeed, we found that MTase-catalyzed transalkylations of DNA with cofactors containing a double or a triple C-C bond in the β position occurred in a robust and sequence-specific manner. Altogether, this breakthrough approach named mTAG (methyltransferase-directed transfer of activated groups) has proven instrumental for targeted labeling of DNA and other types of biomolecules (using appropriate MTases) including RNA and proteins.Our further work focused on the propargylic cofactors and their reactions with DNA cytosine-5 MTases, a class of MTases common for both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Here, we learned that the 4-X-but-2-yn-1-yl (X = polar group) cofactors suffered from a rapid loss of activity in aqueous buffers due to susceptibility of the triple bond to hydration. This problem was remedied by synthetically increasing the separation between X and the triple bond from one to three carbon units (6-X-hex-2-ynyl cofactors). To further optimize the transfer of the bulkier groups, we performed structure-guided engineering of the MTase cofactor pocket. Alanine replacements of two conserved residues conferred substantial improvements of the transalkylation activity with M.HhaI and three other engineered bacterial C5-MTases. Of particular interest were CpG-specific DNA MTases (M.SssI), which proved valuable tools for studies of mammalian methylomes and chemical probing of DNA function.Inspired by the successful repurposing of bacterial enzymes, we turned to more complex mammalian C5-MTases (Dnmt1, Dnmt3A, and Dnmt3B) and asked if they could ultimately lead to mTAG labeling inside mammalian cells. Our efforts to engineer mouse Dnmt1 produced a variant (Dnmt1*) that enabled efficient Dnmt1-directed deposition of 6-azide-hexynyl groups on DNA in vitro. CRISPR-Cas9 editing of the corresponding codons in the genomic Dnmt1 alleles established endogenous expression of Dnmt1* in mouse embryonic stem cells. To circumvent the poor cellular uptake of AdoMet and its analogs, we elaborated their efficient internalization by electroporation, which has finally enabled selective catalysis-dependent azide tagging of natural Dnmt1 targets in live mammalian cells. The deposited chemical groups were then exploited as ""click"" handles for reading adjoining sequences and precise genomic mapping of the methylation sites. These findings offer unprecedented inroads into studies of DNA methylation in a wide range of eukaryotic model systems."
,37903812,NA,NA,"Understanding the contribution of immune mechanisms to Parkinson's disease pathogenesis is an important challenge, potentially of major therapeutic implications. To further elucidate the involvement of peripheral immune cells, we studied epigenome-wide DNA methylation in isolated populations of CD14+monocytes, CD19+B cells, CD4+T cells, and CD8+T cells from Parkinson's disease patients and healthy control participants. We included 25 patients with a maximum five years of disease duration and 25 controls, and isolated four immune cell populations from each fresh blood sample. Epigenome-wide DNA methylation profiles were generated from 186 samples using the Illumina MethylationEpic array and association with disease status was tested using linear regression models. We identified six differentially methylated CpGs in CD14+monocytes and one in CD8 + T cells. Four differentially methylated regions were identified in monocytes, including a region upstream of RAB32, a gene that has been linked to LRRK2. Methylation upstream of RAB32 correlated negatively with mRNA expression, and RAB32 expression was upregulated in Parkinson's disease both in our samples and in summary statistics from a previous study. Our epigenome-wide association study of early Parkinson's disease provides evidence for methylation changes across different peripheral immune cell types, highlighting monocytes and the RAB32 locus. The findings were predominantly cell-type-specific, demonstrating the value of isolating purified cell populations for genomic studies.© 2023. The Author(s)."
,37900250,Methyl-CpG-Binding protein 2 duplication syndrome in a Chinese patient: A case report and review of the literature.,World J Clin Cases,"Chromosomal Xq28 region duplication encompassing methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) results in an identifiable phenotype and global developmental delay known as MECP2 duplication syndrome (MDS). This syndrome has a wide range of clinical manifestations, including abnormalities in appearance, neurodevelopment, and gastrointestinal motility; recurrent infections; and spasticity. Here, we report a case of confirmed MDS at our institution.A 12-year-old Chinese boy presented with intellectual disability (poor intellectual [reasoning, judgment, abstract thinking, and learning] and adaptive [lack of communication and absent social skills, apraxia, and ataxia] functioning) and dysmorphism. He had no history of recurrent infections, seizures, or bowel dysfunction, which is different from that in reported cases. Microarray comparative genomic hybridization confirmed MECP2 duplication in the patient and his mother who is a carrier. The duplication size was the same in the patient and his mother. No prophylactic antibiotic or anti-seizure therapy was offered to the patient or his mother before or after the consultation.MDS is rare and has various clinical presentations. Clinical suspicion is critical in patients presenting with developmental delays.©The Author(s) 2023. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc. All rights reserved."
,37900177,Unidirectional alteration of methylation and hydroxymethylation at the promoters and differential gene expression in oral squamous cell carcinoma.,Front Genet,"Background:Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is one of the most common types of cancer worldwide. Although overall losses of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) have been previously observed, a genome-wide, single-base-resolution, and simultaneous mapping of 5mC and 5hmC in OSCC is still unaccomplished. Similarly, the mechanism of how 5mC and 5hmC collectively lead to abnormal gene expression in OSCC is largely unexplored. Using parallel whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and whole-genome oxidative bisulfite sequencing (oxWGBS), we characterized 5mC- and 5hmC-profiles at single-nucleotide resolution in paired primary OSCC samples and their normal adjacent tissues (NATs). We also analyzed the effect of 5mC- and 5hmC-modifications on differential gene expression in OSCC using multi-omics analysis.Results:An overall reduction of both 5mC and 5hmC in various genomic regions have been observed in OSCC samples. At promoter regions, a total of 6,921 differentially methylated regions and 1,024 differentially hydroxymethylated regions were identified in OSCC. Interestingly, compared to bidirectional modification with 5mC and 5hmC, unidirectional modification with 5mC and 5hmC at the promoters is associated with bigger change in the gene expression. Additionally, genes bearing unidirectional modification with 5mC and 5hmC at the promoters are enriched in signaling pathways like cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and receptor tyrosine kinase pathway that are essential for the tumorigenesis. Finally, the grouped expression signature of top 20 genes bearing promoter-unidirectional-modification with 5mC and 5hmC tends to correlate with the clinical outcome of certain subtypes of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.Conclusion:Using parallel WGBS and oxWGBS analyses, we observed an overall reduction of 5mC- and 5hmC-modifications at various genomic regions in OSCC. Unidirectional modification with 5mC and 5hmC at the promoters is associated with enhanced changes in gene expression in OSCC tissues. Furthermore, such differentially expressed genes bearing unidirectional modifications with 5mC and 5hmC at the promoters might have clinical relevance to the outcome of OSCC.Copyright © 2023 Zhao, Zhu, Gong, Ma, Xiong, Su, Wan and Wang."
,37899449,NA,NA,"During gestation, stressors to the fetus, including viral exposure or maternal psychological distress, can fundamentally alter the neonatal epigenome, and may be associated with long-term impaired developmental outcomes. The impact of in utero exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic on the newborn epigenome has yet to be described.This study aimed to determine whether there are unique epigenetic signatures in newborns who experienced otherwise healthy pregnancies that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic (Project RESCUE). The pre-pandemic control and pandemic cohorts (Project RESCUE) included in this study are part of a prospective observational and longitudinal cohort study that evaluates the impact of elevated prenatal maternal stress during the COVID-19 pandemic on early childhood neurodevelopment. Using buccal swabs collected at birth, differential DNA methylation analysis was performed using the Infinium MethylationEPIC arrays and linear regression analysis. Pathway analysis and gene ontology enrichment were performed on resultant gene lists.Widespread differential methylation was found between neonates exposed in utero to the pandemic and pre-pandemic neonates. In contrast, there were no apparent epigenetic differences associated with maternal COVID-19 infection during pregnancy. Differential methylation was observed among genomic sites that underpin important neurological pathways that have been previously reported in the literature to be differentially methylated because of prenatal stress, such as NR3C1.The present study reveals potential associations between exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic during pregnancy and subsequent changes in the newborn epigenome. While this finding warrants further investigation, it is a point that should be considered in any study assessing newborn DNA methylation studies obtained during this period, even in otherwise healthy pregnancies.© 2023.

,37898998,Analysis of genome-wide 5-hydroxymethylation of blood samples stored in different anticoagulants: opportunities for the expansion of clinical resources for epigenetic research.,Epigenetics,"Elucidating epigenetic mechanisms could provide new biomarkers for disease diagnosis and prognosis. Technological advances allow genome-wide profiling of 5-hydroxymethylcytosines (5hmC) in liquid biopsies. 5hmC-Seal followed by NGS is a highly sensitive technique for 5hmC biomarker discovery in cfDNA. Currently, 5hmC Seal is optimized for EDTA blood collection. We asked whether heparin was compatible with 5hmC Seal as many clinical and biobanked samples are stored in heparin.We obtained 60 samples in EDTA matched to 60 samples in heparin from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. Samples were comprised of 30 controls and 30 individuals who were later diagnosed with colon cancer. We profiled genome-wide 5hmC in cfDNA using 5hmC-Seal assay followed by NGS. The 5hmC profiling data from samples collected in EDTA were systematically compared to those in heparin across various genomic features.cfDNA isolation and library construction appeared comparable in heparin vs. EDTA. Typical genomic distribution patterns of 5hmC, including gene bodies and enhancer markers, were comparable in heparin vs. EDTA. 5hmC analysis of cases and controls yielded highly correlated differential features suggesting that both anticoagulants were compatible with 5hmC Seal assay.While not currently recommended for the 5hmC-Seal protocol, blood samples stored in heparin were successfully used to generate analysable and biologically relevant genome-wide 5hmC profiling. Our findings are the first to support opportunities to expand the biospecimen resource to heparin samples for 5hmC Seal and perhaps other PCR-based technologies in epigenetic research."

However, the molecular mechanisms still remained unclear, and epigenome-wide analysis in cohort were lacking, especially in Chinese. We included blood-derived DNA methylation for 3365 Chinese participants from the NSPT cohort and estimated individual ozone exposure level of short-, intermediate- and long-term, based on a validated prediction model. We performed epigenome-wide association studies which identified 59 CpGs and 30 DMRs at a strict genome-wide significance (P < 5 ×10-8). We also conducted comparison on the DNA methylation alteration corresponding to different time windows, and observed an enhanced differentiated methylation trend for intermediate- and long-term exposure, while the short-term exposure associated methylation changes did not retain. The targeted genes of methylation alteration were involved in mechanism related to aging, inflammation disease, metabolic syndrome, neurodevelopmental disorders, and oncogenesis. Underlying pathways were enriched in biological activities including telomere maintenance process, DNA damage response and megakaryocyte differentiation. In conclusion, our study is the first EWAS on ozone exposure conducted in large-scale Han Chinese cohort and identified associated DNA methylation change on CpGs and regions, as well as related gene functions and pathways.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

,37898083,Prenatal exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances and DNA methylation in the placenta: A prospective cohort study.,J Hazard Mater,"Epidemiological studies regarding the relationship between per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and DNA methylation were limited. We investigated the associations of maternal PFAS concentrations with placental DNA methylation and examined the mediating role of methylation changes between PFAS and infant development. We measured the concentrations of 11 PFAS in maternal plasma during early pregnancy and infant development at six months of age. We analyzed genome-wide DNA methylation in 16 placental samples using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. Additionally, we measured DNA methylation levels using bisulfite amplicon sequencing in 345 mother-infant pairs for five candidate genes, including carbohydrate sulfotransferase 7 (CHST7), fibroblast growth factor 13 (FGF13), insulin receptor substrate 4 (IRS4), paired like homeobox 2Ap (PHOX2A), and plexin domain containing 1 (PLXDC1). We found that placental DNA methylation profiles related to PFOA mainly enriched in angiogenesis and neuronal signaling pathways. PFOA was associated with hypomethylation of IRS4 and PLXDC1, and PFNA was associated with PLXDC1 hypomethylation. There were positive associations of CHST7 methylation with PFTrDA and IRS4 methylation with PFDoA and PFTrDA. PLXDC1 hypomethylation mediated the association between PFOA and suspected developmental delay in infants. Future studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to confirm these findings.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
,37895267,Genome-Wide Identification and Expression Analysis of bZIP Family Genes in Stevia rebaudiana.,Genes (Basel),"The basic (region) leucine zippers (bZIPs) are evolutionarily conserved transcription factors widely distributed in eukaryotic organisms. In plants, they are not only involved in growth and development, defense and stress responses and regulation of physiological processes but also play a pivotal role in regulating secondary metabolism. To explore the function related to the bZIP gene family inStevia rebaudianaBertoni, we identified 105SrbZIPgenes at the genome-wide level and classified them into 12 subfamilies using bioinformation methods. Three main classes ofcis-acting elements were found in theSrbZIPpromoter regions, including development-related elements, defense and stress-responsive elements and phytohormone-responsive elements. Through protein-protein interaction network of 105 SrbZIP proteins, SrbZIP proteins were mainly classified into four major categories: ABF2/ABF4/ABI5 (SrbZIP51/SrbZIP38/SrbZIP7), involved in phytohormone signaling, GBF1/GBF3/GBF4 (SrbZIP29/SrbZIP63/SrbZIP60) involved in environmental signaling, AREB3 (SrbZIP88), PAN (SrbZIP12), TGA1 (SrbZIP69), TGA4 (SrbZIP82), TGA7 (SrbZIP31), TGA9 (SrbZIP95), TGA10 (SrbZIP79) and HY5 (SrbZIP96) involved in cryptochrome signaling, and FD (SrbZIP72) promoted flowering. The transcriptomic data showed thatSrbZIPgenes were differentially expressed in sixS. rebaudianacultivars ('023', '110', 'B1188', '11-14', 'GP' and 'GX'). Moreover, the expression levels of selected 15SrbZIPgenes in response to light, abiotic stress (low temperature, salt and drought), phytohormones (methyl jasmonate, gibberellic acid and salicylic acid) treatment and in different tissues were analyzed utilizing qRT-PCR. SomeSrbZIPgenes were further identified to be highly induced by factors affecting glycoside synthesis. Among them, threeSrbZIPgenes (SrbZIP54,SrbZIP63andSrbZIP32) were predicted to be related to stress-responsive terpenoid synthesis inS. rebaudiana. The protein-protein interaction network expanded the potential functions ofSrbZIPgenes. This study firstly provided the comprehensive genome-wide report of theSrbZIPgene family, laying a foundation for further research on the evolution, function and regulatory role of the bZIP gene family in terpenoid synthesis inS. rebaudiana."
,37895237,Growth and DNA Methylation Alteration in Rice (Oryza sativa L.) in Response to Ozone Stress.,Genes (Basel),"With the development of urban industrialization, the increasing ozone concentration (O3) at ground level stresses on the survival of plants. Plants have to adapt to ozone stress. DNA methylation is crucial for a rapid response to abiotic stress in plants. Little information is known regarding the epigenetic response of DNA methylation of plants to O3stress. This study is designed to explore the epigenetic mechanism and identify a possible core modification of DNA methylation or genes in the plant, in response to O3stress. We investigated the agronomic traits and genome-wide DNA methylation variations of the Japonica rice cultivar Nipponbare in response to O3stress at three high concentrations (80, 160, and 200 nmol·mol-1), simulated using open-top chambers (OTC). The flag leaf length, panicle length, and hundred-grain weight of rice showed beneficial effects at 80 nmol·mol-1O3and an inhibitory effect at both 160 and 200 nmol·mol-1O3.The methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism results showed that the O3-induced genome-wide methylation alterations account for 14.72-15.18% at three different concentrations. Our results demonstrated that methylation and demethylation alteration sites were activated throughout the O3stress, mainly at CNG sites. By recovering and sequencing bands with methylation alteration, ten stress-related differentially amplified sequences, widely present on different chromosomes, were obtained. Our findings show that DNA methylation may be an active and rapid epigenetic response to ozone stress. These results can provide us with a theoretical basis and a reference to look for more hereditary information about the molecular mechanism of plant resistance to O3pollution."
,37895154,The Integration of Genome-Wide DNA Methylation and Transcriptomics Identifies the Potential Genes That Regulate the Development of Skeletal Muscles in Ducks.,Int J Mol Sci,"DNA methylation is a pivotal epigenetic regulatory mechanism in the development of skeletal muscles. Nonetheless, the regulators responsible for DNA methylation in the development of embryonic duck skeletal muscles remain unknown. In the present study, whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and transcriptome sequencing were conducted on the skeletal muscles of embryonic day 21 (E21) and day 28 (E28) ducks. The DNA methylation pattern was found to fall mainly within the cytosine-guanine (CG) context, with high methylation levels in the intron, exon, and promoter regions. Overall, 7902 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified, which corresponded to 3174 differentially methylated genes (DMGs). By using integrative analysis of both WGBS with transcriptomics, we identified 1072 genes that are DMGs that are negatively associated with differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed significant enrichment in phosphorylation, kinase activity, phosphotransferase activity, alcohol-based receptors, and binding to cytoskeletal proteins. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGGs) analysis showed significant enrichment in MAPK signaling, Wnt signaling, apelin signaling, insulin signaling, and FoxO signaling. The screening of enriched genes showed that hyper-methylation inhibited the expression ofIdh3a,Got1,Bcl2,Mylk2,Klf2,Erbin, andKlhl38, and hypo-methylation stimulated the expression ofCol22a1,Dnmt3b,Fn1,E2f1,Rprm, andWfikkn1. Further predictions showed that the CpG islands in the promoters ofKlhl38,Klf2,Erbin,Mylk2, andGot1may play a crucial role in regulating the development of skeletal muscles. This study provides new insights into the epigenetic regulation of the development of duck skeletal muscles."
,37894868,Genome-Wide Identification and Characterization of the YTH Domain-Containing RNA-Binding Protein Family in Liriodendron chinense.,Int J Mol Sci,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is becoming one of the most important RNA modifications in plant growth and development, including defense, cell differentiation, and secondary metabolism. YT521-B homology (YTH) domain-containing RNA-binding proteins, identified as m6A readers in epitranscriptomics, could affect the fate of m6A-containing RNA by recognizing and binding the m6A site. Therefore, the identification and study of the YTH gene family inLiriodendron chinense(L. chinense) can provide a molecular basis for the study of the role of m6A inL. chinense, but studies on theYTHgene inL. chinensehave not been reported. We identified nine putativeYTHgene models in theL. chinensegenome, which can be divided into DF subgroups and DC subgroups. Domain sequence analysis showed that the LcYTH protein had high sequence conservation. A LcYTH aromatic cage bag is composed of tryptophan and tryptophan (WWW). PrLDs were found in the protein results of YTH, suggesting that these genes may be involved in the process of liquid-liquid phase separation.LcYTHgenes have different tissue expression patterns, but the expression ofLcYTHDF2is absolutely dominant in all tissues. In addition, the expression of theLcYTHgenes is changed in response to ABA and MeJA. In this study, We identified and analyzed the expression pattern ofLcYTHgenes. Our results laid a foundation for further study of the function of theLcYTHgene and further genetic and functional analyses of m6A RNA modification in forest trees."
,37894862,Genome-Wide Identification and Analysis of the Genes Encoding Q-Type C2H2 Zinc Finger Proteins in Grapevine.,Int J Mol Sci,"Q-type C2H2 zinc finger proteins (ZFPs), the largest family of transcription factors, have been extensively studied in plant genomes. However, the genes encoding this transcription factor family have not been explored in grapevine genomes. Therefore, in this study, we conducted a genome-wide identification ofZFPgenes in three species of grapevine, namelyVitis vinifera,Vitis riparia, andVitis amurensis, based on the sequence databases and phylogenetic and their conserved domains. We identified 52, 54, and 55 members of Q-type C2H2ZFPsinV. vinifera,V. riparia, andV. amurensis, respectively. The physical and chemical properties of VvZFPs, VrZFPs, and VaZFPs were examined. The results showed that these proteins exhibited differences in the physical and chemical properties and that they all were hydrophobic proteins; the instability index showed that the four proteins were stable. The subcellular location of theZFPsin the grapevine was predicted mainly in the nucleus. The phylogenetic tree analysis of the amino acid sequences of VvZFP,VaZFP,VrZFP, andAtZFPproteins showed that they were closely related and were divided into six subgroups. Chromosome mapping analysis showed thatVvZFPs,VrZFPs, andVaZFPswere unevenly distributed on different chromosomes. The clustered gene analysis showed that the motif distribution was similar and the sequence of genes was highly conserved. Exon and intron structure analysis showed that 118 genes ofZFPswere intron deletion types, and the remaining genes had variable numbers of introns, ranging from 2 to 15. Cis-element analysis showed that the promoter ofVvZFPscontained multiple cis-elements related to plant hormone response, stress resistance, and growth, among which the stress resistance elements were the predominant elements. Finally, the expression ofVvZFPgenes was determined using real-time quantitative PCR, which confirmed that the identified genes were involved in response to methyl jasmonate (MeJA), abscisic acid (ABA), salicylic acid (SA), and low-temperature (4 °C) stress.VvZFP10-GFP andVvZFP46-GFP fusion proteins were localized in the nucleus of tobacco cells, andVvZFP10is the most responsive gene among allVvZFPswith the highest relative expression level to MeJA, ABA, SA and low-temperature (4 °C) stress. The present study provides a theoretical basis for exploring the mechanism of response to exogenous hormones and low-temperature tolerance in grapes and its molecular breeding in the future."
,37891690,Multi-tissue epigenetic analysis identifies distinct associations underlying insulin resistance and Alzheimer's disease at CPT1A locus.,Clin Epigenetics,"Insulin resistance (IR) is a major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. The mechanisms by which IR predisposes to AD are not well-understood. Epigenetic studies may help identify molecular signatures of IR associated with AD, thus improving our understanding of the biological and regulatory mechanisms linking IR and AD.We conducted an epigenome-wide association study of IR, quantified using the homeostatic model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) and adjusted for body mass index, in 3,167 participants from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) without type 2 diabetes at the time of blood draw used for methylation measurement. We identified DNA methylation markers associated with IR at the genome-wide level accounting for multiple testing (P < 1.1 × 10-7) and evaluated their association with neurological traits in participants from the FHS (N = 3040) and the Religious Orders Study/Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP, N = 707). DNA methylation profiles were measured in blood (FHS) or dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (ROSMAP) using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Linear regressions (ROSMAP) or mixed-effects models accounting for familial relatedness (FHS) adjusted for age, sex, cohort, self-reported race, batch, and cell type proportions were used to assess associations between DNA methylation and neurological traits accounting for multiple testing.We confirmed the strong association of blood DNA methylation with IR at three loci (cg17901584-DHCR24, cg17058475-CPT1A, cg00574958-CPT1A, and cg06500161-ABCG1). In FHS, higher levels of blood DNA methylation at cg00574958 and cg17058475 were both associated with lower IR (P = 2.4 × 10-11and P = 9.0 × 10-8), larger total brain volumes (P = 0.03 and P = 9.7 × 10-4), and smaller log lateral ventricular volumes (P = 0.07 and P = 0.03). In ROSMAP, higher levels of brain DNA methylation at the same two CPT1A markers were associated with greater risk of cognitive impairment (P = 0.005 and P = 0.02) and higher AD-related indices (CERAD score: P = 5 × 10-4and 0.001; Braak stage: P = 0.004 and P = 0.01).Our results suggest potentially distinct epigenetic regulatory mechanisms between peripheral blood and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissues underlying IR and AD at CPT1A locus.© 2023.

,37891670,Profound DNA methylomic differences between single- and multi-fraction alpha irradiations of lung fibroblasts.,Clin Epigenetics,"Alpha (α)-radiation is a ubiquitous environmental agent with epigenotoxic effects. Human exposure to α-radiation at potentially harmful levels can occur repetitively over the long term via inhalation of naturally occurring radon gas that accumulates in enclosed spaces, or as a result of a single exposure from a nuclear accident. Alterations in epigenetic DNA methylation (DNAm) have been implicated in normal aging and cancer pathogenesis. Nevertheless, the effects of aberrations in the methylome of human lung cells following exposure to single or multiple α-irradiation events on these processes remain unexplored.We performed genome-wide DNAm profiling of human embryonic lung fibroblasts from control and irradiated cells using americium-241 α-sources. Cells were α-irradiated in quadruplicates to seven doses using two exposure regimens, a single-fraction (SF) where the total dose was given at once, and a multi-fraction (MF) method, where the total dose was equally distributed over 14 consecutive days. Our results revealed that SF irradiations were prone to a decrease in DNAm levels, while MF irradiations mostly increased DNAm. The analysis also showed that the gene body (i.e., exons and introns) was the region most altered by both the SF hypomethylation and the MF hypermethylation. Additionally, the MF irradiations induced the highest number of differentially methylated regions in genes associated with DNAm biomarkers of aging, carcinogenesis, and cardiovascular disease. The DNAm profile of the oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes suggests that the fibroblasts manifested a defensive response to the MF α-irradiation. Key DNAm events of ionizing radiation exposure, including changes in methylation levels in mitochondria dysfunction-related genes, were mainly identified in the MF groups. However, these alterations were under-represented, indicating that the mitochondria undergo adaptive mechanisms, aside from DNAm, in response to radiation-induced oxidative stress.We identified a contrasting methylomic profile in the lung fibroblasts α-irradiated to SF compared with MF exposures. These findings demonstrate that the methylome response of the lung cells to α-radiation is highly dependent on both the total dose and the exposure regimen. They also provide novel insights into potential biomarkers of α-radiation, which may contribute to the development of innovative approaches to detect, prevent, and treat α-particle-related diseases.© 2023.

,37891007,NA,NA,"In this study we investigated how an emerging RNA virus evolves, interacts and adapts to populations of a novel host species with defects in epigenetically-controlled plant defense mechanisms. Mutations in epigenetic regulatory pathways would exert different effects in defense-response genes but also induce large-scale alterations in cellular physiology and homeostasis. To test whether these effects condition the emergence and subsequent adaptation of a viral pathogen, we have evolved five independent lineages of a naïve turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) strain in a set of Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes carrying mutations that influence important elements of two main epigenetic pathways and compare the results with those obtained for viral lineages evolved in wild-type plants. All evolved lineages showed adaptation to the lack of epigenetically-regulated responses through significant increases in infectivity, virulence and viral load although the magnitude of the improvements strongly depended on the plant genotype. In early passages, these traits evolved more rapidly, but the rate of evolution flattened out in later ones. Viral load was positively correlated with different measures of virulence, though the strength of the associations changed from the ancestral to the evolved viruses. High-throughput sequencing was used to evaluate the viral diversity of each lineage, as well as characterizing the nature of fixed mutations, evolutionary convergences and potential targets of TuMV adaptation. Within each lineage, we observed a net increase in genome-wide genetic diversity, with some instances where nonsynonymous alleles experienced a transient rise in abundance before being displaced by the ancestral allele. In agreement with previous studies, viral VPg protein has been shown as a key player in the adaptation process, even though no obvious association between fixed alleles and host genotype was found.© The Author(s) 2023.

x,37890265,Air pollution and epigenetic aging among Black and White women in the US.,Environ Int,"DNA methylation-based measures of biological aging have been associated with air pollution and may link pollutant exposures to aging-related health outcomes. However, evidence is inconsistent and there is little information for Black women.We examined associations of ambient particulate matter <2.5 μm and <10 μm in diameter (PM2.5and PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) with DNA methylation, including epigenetic aging and individual CpG sites, and evaluated whether associations differ between Black and non-Hispanic White (NHW) women.Validated models were used to estimate annual average outdoor residential exposure to PM2.5, PM10, and NO2in a sample of self-identified Black (n=633) and NHW (n=3493) women residing in the contiguous US. We used sampling-weighted generalized linear regression to examine the effects of pollutants on six epigenetic aging measures (primary: DunedinPACE, GrimAgeAccel, and PhenoAgeAccel; secondary: Horvath intrinsic epigenetic age acceleration [EAA], Hannum extrinsic EAA, and skin & blood EAA) and epigenome-wide associations for individual CpG sites. Wald tests of nested models with and without interaction terms were used to examine effect measure modification by race/ethnicity.Black participants had higher median air pollution exposure than NHW participants. GrimAgeAccel was associated with both PM10and NO2among Black participants, (Q4 versus Q1, PM10: β=1.09, 95% CI: 0.16-2.03; NO2: β=1.01, 95% CI 0.08-1.94) but not NHW participants (p-for-heterogeneity: PM10=0.10, NO2=0.20). In Black participants, we also observed a monotonic exposure-response relationship between NO2and DunedinPACE (Q4 versus Q1, NO2: β=0.029, 95% CI: 0.004-0.055; p-for-trend=0.03), which was not observed in NHW participants (p-for-heterogeneity=0.09). In the EWAS, pollutants were significantly associated with differential methylation at 19 CpG sites in Black women and one in NHW women.In a US-wide cohort study, our findings suggest that air pollution is associated with DNA methylation alterations consistent with higher epigenetic aging among Black, but not NHW, women.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

We hypothesized that PM2.5 cause abnormal embryonic development by interfering with DNA methylation and mRNA expression. In this study, we observed that human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) treated with extractable organic matters (EOM) from PM2.5 concentrations above 100 μg/mL exhibited reduced viability. While EOM within non-cytotoxicity concentrations did not affect the expression levels of pluripotency genes, it did enhance cellular proliferation, as indicated by increased Edu incorporation and the upregulation of cell cycle genes (Cdk2, Mdm2). Additionally, EOM significantly influenced the transcriptome patterns in hESCs. Notably, the differentially expressed genes were found to be significantly enriched in processes such as extracellular matrix organization, cell-cell junction organization, chromatin organization, and DNA methylation. Furthermore, we observed whole genomic-wide DNA methylation changes. Through a cross-analysis of changes in DNA methylation and mRNA expression, we identified an enrichment of terms related to the VEGFR signaling pathway and extracellular matrix. The gene signal transduction networks revealed that crucial hubs were implicated in cell growth and division. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that PM2.5 induce significant alterations in transcriptome and DNA methylome in hESCs, leading to aberrant cell proliferation. This research provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the developmental toxicity of PM2.5."

It stands as a significant ailment impacting oral functionality, aesthetics, and quality of life. Longitudinal studies indicate that malocclusion in primary dentition may progress to permanent malocclusion. Recognizing and managing malocclusion in primary dentition is gaining prominence. The World Health Organization ranks malocclusions as the third most widespread oral health issue globally. Angle's classification system is widely used to categorize malocclusions, with Class I occlusion considered the norm. However, its prevalence varies across populations due to genetic and examination disparities. Genetic factors, including variants in genes like MSX1, PAX9, and AXIN2, have been associated with an increased risk of Class I occlusion. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of clinical strategies for managing Class I occlusion and consolidate genetic insights from both human and murine populations. Additionally, genomic relationships among craniofacial genes will be assessed in individuals with Class I occlusion, along with a murine model, shedding light on phenotype-genotype associations of clinical relevance. The prevalence of Class I occlusion, its impact, and treatment approaches will be discussed, emphasizing the importance of early intervention. Additionally, the role of RNA alterations in skeletal Class I occlusion will be explored, focusing on variations in expression or structure that influence craniofacial development. Mouse models will be highlighted as crucial tools for investigating mandible size and prognathism and conducting QTL analysis to gain deeper genetic insights. This review amalgamates cellular, molecular, and clinical trait data to unravel correlations between malocclusion and Class I phenotypes."
,37885806,The role of branched-chain aminotransferase 1 in driving glioblastoma cell proliferation and invasion varies with tumor subtype.,Neurooncol Adv,"Branched-chain aminotransferase 1 (BCAT1) has been proposed to drive proliferation and invasion of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wild-type glioblastoma cells. However, the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset shows considerable variation in the expression of this enzyme in glioblastoma. The aim of this study was to determine the role of BCAT1 in driving the proliferation and invasion of glioblastoma cells and xenografts that have widely differing levels of BCAT1 expression and the mechanism responsible.The activity of BCAT1 was modulated inIDHwild-type patient-derived glioblastoma cell lines, and in orthotopically implanted tumors derived from these cells, to examine the effects of BCAT1 expression on tumor phenotype.In cells with constitutively high BCAT1 expression and a glycolytic metabolic phenotype, inducible shRNA knockdown of the enzyme resulted in reduced proliferation and invasion by increasing the concentration of α-ketoglutarate, leading to reduced DNA methylation, HIF-1α destabilization, and reduced expression of the transcription factor Forkhead box protein M1 (FOXM1). Conversely, overexpression of the enzyme increased HIF-1α expression and promoted proliferation and invasion. However, in cells with an oxidative phenotype and very low constitutive expression of BCAT1 increased expression of the enzyme had no effect on invasion and reduced cell proliferation. This occurred despite an increase in HIF-1α levels and could be explained by decreased TCA cycle flux.There is a wide variation in BCAT1 expression in glioblastoma and its role in proliferation and invasion is dependent on tumor subtype.© The Author(s) 2023.

,37885041,NA,NA,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease with a poor prognosis. Dysregulation of the epigenetic machinery is a significant contributor to disease development. Some AML patients benefit from treatment with hypomethylating agents (HMAs), but no predictive biomarkers for therapy response exist. Here, we investigated whether unbiased genome-wide assessment of pre-treatment DNA-methylation profiles in AML bone marrow blasts can help to identify patients who will achieve a remission after an azacytidine-containing induction regimen.A total of n = 155 patients with newly diagnosed AML treated in the AMLSG 12-09 trial were randomly assigned to a screening and a refinement and validation cohort. The cohorts were divided according to azacytidine-containing induction regimens and response status. Methylation status was assessed for 664,227 500-bp-regions using methyl-CpG immunoprecipitation-seq, resulting in 1755 differentially methylated regions (DMRs). Top regions were distilled and included genes such as WNT10A and GATA3. 80% of regions identified as a hit were represented on HumanMethlyation 450k Bead Chips. Quantitative methylation analysis confirmed 90% of these regions (36 of 40 DMRs). A classifier was trained using penalized logistic regression and fivefold cross validation containing 17 CpGs. Validation based on mass spectra generated by MALDI-TOF failed (AUC 0.59). However, discriminative ability was maintained by adding neighboring CpGs. A recomposed classifier with 12 CpGs resulted in an AUC of 0.77. When evaluated in the non-azacytidine containing group, the AUC was 0.76.Our analysis evaluated the value of a whole genome methyl-CpG screening assay for the identification of informative methylation changes. We also compared the informative content and discriminatory power of regions and single CpGs for predicting response to therapy. The relevance of the identified DMRs is supported by their association with key regulatory processes of oncogenic transformation and support the idea of relevant DMRs being enriched at distinct loci rather than evenly distribution across the genome. Predictive response to therapy could be established but lacked specificity for treatment with azacytidine. Our results suggest that a predictive epigenotype carries its methylation information at a complex, genome-wide level, that is confined to regions, rather than to single CpGs. With increasing application of combinatorial regimens, response prediction may become even more complicated.© 2023. The Author(s)."
,37884963,Peripheral blood DNA methylation and neuroanatomical responses to HDACi treatment that rescues neurological deficits in a Kabuki syndrome mouse model.,Clin Epigenetics,"Recent findings from studies of mouse models of Mendelian disorders of epigenetic machinery strongly support the potential for postnatal therapies to improve neurobehavioral and cognitive deficits. As several of these therapies move into human clinical trials, the search for biomarkers of treatment efficacy is a priority. A potential postnatal treatment of Kabuki syndrome type 1 (KS1), caused by pathogenic variants in KMT2D encoding a histone-lysine methyltransferase, has emerged using a mouse model of KS1 (Kmt2d+/βGeo). In this mouse model, hippocampal memory deficits are ameliorated following treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), AR-42. Here, we investigate the effect of both Kmt2d+/βGeogenotype and AR-42 treatment on neuroanatomy and on DNA methylation (DNAm) in peripheral blood. While peripheral blood may not be considered a ""primary tissue"" with respect to understanding the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders, it has the potential to serve as an accessible biomarker of disease- and treatment-related changes in the brain.Half of the KS1 and wildtype mice were treated with 14 days of AR-42. Following treatment, fixed brain samples were imaged using MRI to calculate regional volumes. Blood was assayed for genome-wide DNAm at over 285,000 CpG sites using the Illumina Infinium Mouse Methylation array. DNAm patterns and brain volumes were analyzed in the four groups of animals: wildtype untreated, wildtype AR-42 treated, KS1 untreated and KS1 AR-42 treated.We defined a DNAm signature in the blood of KS1 mice, that overlapped with the human KS1 DNAm signature. We also found a striking 10% decrease in total brain volume in untreated KS1 mice compared to untreated wildtype, which correlated with DNAm levels in a subset KS1 signature sites, suggesting that disease severity may be reflected in blood DNAm. Treatment with AR-42 ameliorated DNAm aberrations in KS1 mice at a small number of signature sites.As this treatment impacts both neurological deficits and blood DNAm in mice, future KS clinical trials in humans could be used to assess blood DNAm as an early biomarker of therapeutic efficacy.© 2023.

,37884744,NA,NA,"Analysis of selected cancer genes has become an important tool in precision oncology but cannot fully capture the molecular features and, most importantly, vulnerabilities of individual tumors. Observational and interventional studies have shown that decision-making based on comprehensive molecular characterization adds significant clinical value. However, the complexity and heterogeneity of the resulting data are major challenges for disciplines involved in interpretation and recommendations for individualized care, and limited information exists on how to approach multilayered tumor profiles in clinical routine.

,37883365,Histone methyltransferase activity affects metabolism in human cells independently of transcriptional regulation.,PLoS Biol,"The N-terminal tails of eukaryotic histones are frequently posttranslationally modified. The role of these modifications in transcriptional regulation is well-documented. However, the extent to which the enzymatic processes of histone posttranslational modification might affect metabolic regulation is less clear. Here, we investigated how histone methylation might affect metabolism using metabolomics, proteomics, and RNA-seq data from cancer cell lines, primary tumour samples and healthy tissue samples. In cancer, the expression of histone methyltransferases (HMTs) was inversely correlated to the activity of NNMT, an enzyme previously characterised as a methyl sink that disposes of excess methyl groups carried by the universal methyl donor S-adenosyl methionine (SAM or AdoMet). In healthy tissues, histone methylation was inversely correlated to the levels of an alternative methyl sink, PEMT. These associations affected the levels of multiple histone marks on chromatin genome-wide but had no detectable impact on transcriptional regulation. We show that HMTs with a variety of different associations to transcription are co-regulated by the Retinoblastoma (Rb) tumour suppressor in human cells. Rb-mutant cancers show increased total HMT activity and down-regulation of NNMT. Together, our results suggest that the total activity of HMTs affects SAM metabolism, independent of transcriptional regulation.Copyright: © 2023 Perez, Sarkies.

,37882553,Integrative DNA methylome and transcriptome analysis reveals DNA adenine methylation is involved in Salmonella enterica Typhimurium response to oxidative stress.,Microbiol Spectr,"Salmonellacould survive and replicate in macrophages, where it encounters multiple stresses. Deficiency of a DNA adenine methyltransferase impairs the survival ofSalmonella entericaserovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) in hydrogen peroxide. To investigate whether DNA methylation is involved in the expression of oxidative stress-responsive genes, we combined RNA-seq and single-molecule real-time sequencing to integrate transcriptome and methylome analysis. Here, we show that (i) the entire amount of m6A GATC remains stable during oxidative stress; (ii) no significant association is observed between DNA methylation and transcription level in most genes; (iii) coincidence of level change between transcription and m6A GATC in the regulatory regions is identified in 49 genes under oxidative stress. Some of them are known to contribute to bacterial defenses against oxidative stress through reducing H2O2levels, directing aberrant protein product degradation and inducing outer membrane protein expression. Specifically, the transcription level ofahpCFis negatively correlated to the m6A GATC level in its regulatory region. The transcription ofsmpBis elevated along with the decrease in m6A level at position 2,879,954 on the minus strand. In contrast, mRNA levels ofSTM14_2773andycfRare positively correlated with m6A GATC content in their regulatory regions. Highly stable DNA methylome and coupled change of m6A GATC with gene expression in specific positions suggest that DNA methylation homeostasis at genome-wide and plasticity in specific regions are crucial for bacterial response to oxidative stress. These findings provide new insights into the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms of gene expression inS. Typhimurium in the host microenvironment.IMPORTANCEThe intracellular pathogenSalmonella entericaserovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) comes across a wide variety of stresses from entry to dissemination, such as reactive oxygen species. To adapt itself to oxidative stress,Salmonellamust adopt various and complex strategies. In this study, we revealed that DNA adenine methyltransferase was essential forS. Typhimurium to survive in hydrogen peroxide. We then screened out oxidative stress-responsive genes that were potentially regulated by DNA methylation inS. Typhimurium. Our results show that the DNA methylome is highly stable throughout the genome, and the coupled change of m6A GATC with gene expression is identified in only a few positions, which suggests the complexity of the DNA methylation and gene expression regulation networks. The results may shed light on our understanding of m6A-mediated gene expression regulation in bacteria."

Nine women who received IVF treatment were recruited for this study. The retrieved eight-cell human embryos were classified into three groups including fresh embryos, cryopreserved embryos stored for 3 years, and cryopreserved embryos stored for 8 years. Single-cell whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (scWGBS) was conducted. The genome-wide methylation pattern of the fresh and two cryopreserved groups were similar. In addition, the methylation level in different genomic regions showed comparable patterns and no significant differences were observed in the methylation level of imprinted genes among the three groups. A total of 587 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in the 3-year group and 540 DMRs in the 8-year group were identified comparing to fresh group. However, they were not enriched in promoters and had a similar genome-wide distributions, suggesting that these DMRs may not contribute to the changes in corresponding gene expressions. Our study illustrated that long-term cryopreservation will not affect the DNA methylation profiles of human eight-cell embryos at single-cell level.© 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC."

Genome-wide association studies have reported that an increasing number of risk-associated variants and polygenic risk scores (PRSs) explain 17% of the variance in the disorder. Substantial heterogeneity exists in the effect of these variants, and aggregating them based on biologically relevant functions may provide mechanistic insight into the disorder.Using the largest schizophrenia genome-wide association study conducted to date, we associated PRSs based on 5 gene sets previously found to contribute to schizophrenia pathophysiology-postsynaptic density of excitatory synapses, postsynaptic membrane, dendritic spine, axon, and histone H3-K4 methylation-along with respective whole-genome PRSs, with neuroimaging (n> 29,000) and reported psychotic-like experiences (n> 119,000) variables in healthy UK Biobank subjects.Several variables were significantly associated with the axon gene-set (psychotic-like communications, parahippocampal gyrus volume, fractional anisotropy thalamic radiations, and fractional anisotropy posterior thalamic radiations (β range -0.016 to 0.0916, false discovery rate-correctedp[pFDR] ≤ .05), postsynaptic density gene-set (psychotic-like experiences distress, global surface area, and cingulate lobe surface area [β range -0.014 to 0.0588,pFDR≤ .05]), and histone gene set (entorhinal surface area: β = -0.016,pFDR = .035). From these, whole-genome PRSs were significantly associated with psychotic-like communications (β = 0.2218,pFDR = 1.34 × 10-7), distress (β = 0.1943,pFDR = 7.28 × 10-16), and fractional anisotropy thalamic radiations (β = -0.0143,pFDR = .036). Permutation analysis revealed that these associations were not due to chance.Our results indicate that genetic variation in 3 gene sets relevant to schizophrenia may confer risk for the disorder through effects on previously implicated neuroimaging variables. Because associations were stronger overall for whole-genome PRSs, findings here highlight that selection of biologically relevant variants is not yet sufficient to address the heterogeneity of the disorder.© 2023 The Authors."

However, the genetic and epigenetic alterations underlying its pathogenesis remain unknown. DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification involved in many biological processes.In this study, enzymatic methyl-sequencing (EM-seq) technique was used to investigate the landscape of genome-wide DNA methylation from three pairs of tumor tissues and adjacent tissues of patients with EMPD. Additionally, we conducted histopathological examinations to assess the expression of fatty acid-binding protein 5 (FABP5) in another three paired samples from EMPD patients.The cluster analysis showed the good quality of the samples. A differential methylation region (DMR) heat map was used to quantitatively characterize genome-wide methylation differences between tumors and controls. Global DNA methylation level is lower in EMPD tissue compared to matched controls, indicating that DNA methylation discriminates between tumor and normal skin. And the top hypomethylation gene on the promoter region in tumor tissues was FABP5 on chromosome 8 with 38.44% decreased median methylation. We next identified the expression of FABP5 in paired tumors and adjacent tissues in three additional patients with EMPD. Immunofluorescence results showed FABP5 highly expressed in tumor tissues and co-located with CK7, CK20 and EMA. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis showed DMR genes on promoter are mainly enriched in the calcium ion transport, GTPase mediated signal transduction, Rap1 signaling pathway and GnRH signaling pathway.Taken together, our findings provide the first description of the whole genome methylation map of EMPD and identify FABP5 as a pathogenic target of EMPD.© 2023 The Authors.

Aberrant changes in DNA methylation are implicated in various neurodevelopmental disorders but remain unstudied in DEEs. Rare epigenetic variations (""epivariants"") can drive disease by modulating gene expression at single loci, whereas genome-wide DNA methylation changes can result in distinct ""episignature"" biomarkers for monogenic disorders in a growing number of rare diseases. Here, we interrogate the diagnostic utility of genome-wide DNA methylation array analysis on peripheral blood samples from 516 individuals with genetically unsolved DEEs who had previously undergone extensive genetic testing. We identified rare differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and explanatory episignatures to discover causative and candidate genetic etiologies in 10 individuals. We then used long-read sequencing to identify DNA variants underlying rare DMRs, including one balanced translocation, three CG-rich repeat expansions, and two copy number variants. We also identify pathogenic sequence variants associated with episignatures; some had been missed by previous exome sequencing. Although most DEE genes lack known episignatures, the increase in diagnostic yield for DNA methylation analysis in DEEs is comparable to the added yield of genome sequencing. Finally, we refine an episignature forCHD2using an 850K methylation array which was further refined at higher CpG resolution using bisulfite sequencing to investigate potential insights intoCHD2pathophysiology. Our study demonstrates the diagnostic yield of genome-wide DNA methylation analysis to identify causal and candidate genetic causes as ∼2% (10/516) for unsolved DEE cases."

However, the role of epigenetic modifications is less understood. ATAC-seq, whole genome bisulfite sequencing, and RNA-seq were applied to investigate the epigenetic dynamics of muscle in Hu sheep at 3 days, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after birth. All 6865 differentially expressed genes were assigned into three distinct tendencies, highlighting the balanced protein synthesis, accumulated immune activities, and restrained cell division in postnatal development. We identified 3742 differentially accessible regions and 11799 differentially methylated regions that were associated with muscle-development-related pathways in certain stages, like D3-M6. Transcription factor network analysis, based on genomic loci with high chromatin accessibility and low methylation, showed that ARID5B, MYOG, and ENO1 were associated with muscle hypertrophy, while NR1D1, FADS1, ZFP36L2, and SLC25A1 were associated with muscle fiber transformation. Taken together, these results suggest that DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility contributed toward regulating the growth and fiber transformation of postnatal skeletal muscle in Hu sheep.© 2023.

,37871278,Epigenome-wide association study of systemic effects of obesity susceptibility in human twins.,Epigenetics,"The current study was designed to use an epigenome-wide association approach (EWAS) to identify potential systemic DNA methylation alterations that are associated with obesity using 22 discordant twin pairs. Buccal cells (from a cheek swab) were used as a non-obesity relevant purified marker cell for the epigenetic analysis. Analysis of differential DNA methylation regions (DMRs) was used to identify epigenetic associations with metabolic and dietary measures related to obesity with discordant twins. An edgeR analysis provided a DMR signature withp < 1e-04, but statistical significance was reduced due to low sample size and known multiple origins of obesity. A weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed and identified modules (p < 0.005) of epigenetic sites that correlated with different metabolic and dietary measures. The DMR and WGCNA epigenetic sites were near genes (e.g., CIDEC, SPP1, ZFPG9, and POMC) with previously identified obesity associated pathways (e.g., metabolism, cholesterol, and fat digestion). Observations demonstrate the feasibility of identifying systemic epigenetic biomarkers for obesity, which can be further investigated for clinical relevance in future research with larger sample sizes. The availability of a systemic epigenetic biomarker for obesity susceptibility may facilitate preventative medicine and clinical management of the disease early in life."
,37871105,Precision pharmacological reversal of strain-specific diet-induced metabolic syndrome in mice informed by epigenetic and transcriptional regulation.,PLoS Genet,"Diet-related metabolic syndrome is the largest contributor to adverse health in the United States. However, the study of gene-environment interactions and their epigenomic and transcriptomic integration is complicated by the lack of environmental and genetic control in humans that is possible in mouse models. Here we exposed three mouse strains, C57BL/6J (BL6), A/J, and NOD/ShiLtJ (NOD), to a high-fat, high-carbohydrate diet, leading to varying degrees of metabolic syndrome. We then performed transcriptomic and genome-wide DNA methylation analyses for each strain and found overlapping but also highly divergent changes in gene expression and methylation upstream of the discordant metabolic phenotypes. Strain-specific pathway analysis of dietary effects revealed a dysregulation of cholesterol biosynthesis common to all three strains but distinct regulatory networks driving this dysregulation. This suggests a strategy for strain-specific targeted pharmacologic intervention of these upstream regulators informed by epigenetic and transcriptional regulation. As a pilot study, we administered the drug GW4064 to target one of these genotype-dependent networks, the Farnesoid X receptor pathway, and found that GW4064 exerts strain-specific protection against dietary effects in BL6, as predicted by our transcriptomic analysis. Furthermore, GW4064 treatment induced inflammatory-related gene expression changes in NOD, indicating a strain-specific effect in its associated toxicities as well as its therapeutic efficacy. This pilot study demonstrates the potential efficacy of precision therapeutics for genotype-informed dietary metabolic intervention and a mouse platform for guiding this approach.Copyright: © 2023 Wulfridge et al.

,37865086,Identification of a robust DNA methylation signature for Fanconi anemia.,Am J Hum Genet,"Fanconi anemia (FA) is a clinically variable and genetically heterogeneous cancer-predisposing disorder representing the most common bone marrow failure syndrome. It is caused by inactivating predominantly biallelic mutations involving >20 genes encoding proteins with roles in the FA/BRCA DNA repair pathway. Molecular diagnosis of FA is challenging due to the wide spectrum of the contributing gene mutations and structural rearrangements. The assessment of chromosomal fragility after exposure to DNA cross-linking agents is generally required to definitively confirm diagnosis. We assessed peripheral blood genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles in 25 subjects with molecularly confirmed clinical diagnosis of FA (FANCA complementation group) using Illumina's Infinium EPIC array. We identified 82 differentially methylated CpG sites that allow to distinguish subjects with FA from healthy individuals and subjects with other genetic disorders, defining an FA-specific DNAm signature. The episignature was validated using a second cohort of subjects with FA involving different complementation groups, documenting broader genetic sensitivity and demonstrating its specificity using the EpiSign Knowledge Database. The episignature properly classified DNA samples obtained from bone marrow aspirates, demonstrating robustness. Using the selected probes, we trained a machine-learning model able to classify EPIC DNAm profiles in molecularly unsolved cases. Finally, we show that the generated episignature includes CpG sites that do not undergo functional selective pressure, allowing diagnosis of FA in individuals with reverted phenotype due to gene conversion. These findings provide a tool to accelerate diagnostic testing in FA and broaden the clinical utility of DNAm profiling in the diagnostic setting.Copyright © 2023 American Society of Human Genetics.

,37864542,DNA methylation differences between stick insect ecotypes.,Mol Ecol,"Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, can influence gene regulation and affect phenotypic variation, raising the possibility that they contribute to ecological adaptation. Beginning to address this issue requires high-resolution sequencing studies of natural populations to pinpoint epigenetic regions of potential ecological and evolutionary significance. However, such studies are still relatively uncommon, especially in insects, and are mainly restricted to a few model organisms. Here, we characterize patterns of DNA methylation for natural populations of Timema cristinae adapted to two host plant species (i.e. ecotypes). By integrating results from sequencing of whole transcriptomes, genomes and methylomes, we investigate whether environmental, host and genetic differences of these stick insects are associated with methylation levels of cytosine nucleotides in the CpG context. We report an overall genome-wide methylation level for T. cristinae of ~14%, with methylation being enriched in gene bodies and impoverished in repetitive elements. Genome-wide DNA methylation variation was strongly positively correlated with genetic distance (relatedness), but also exhibited significant host-plant effects. Using methylome-environment association analysis, we pinpointed specific genomic regions that are differentially methylated between ecotypes, with these regions being enriched for genes with functions in membrane processes. The observed association between methylation variation and genetic relatedness, and with the ecologically important variable of host plant, suggests a potential role for epigenetic modification in T. cristinae adaptation. To substantiate such adaptive significance, future studies could test whether methylation can be transmitted across generations and the extent to which it responds to experimental manipulation in field and laboratory studies.© 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

This study presents an in-depth clinico-biological analysis of 20 newly reported individuals with BCL11B-RD, coupled with a characterization of genome-wide DNA methylation patterns of this genetic condition.Through an international collaboration, clinical and molecular data from 20 individuals were systematically gathered, and a comparative analysis was conducted between this series and existing literature. We further scrutinized peripheral blood DNA methylation profile of individuals with BCL11B-RD, contrasting them with healthy controls and other neurodevelopmental disorders marked by established episignature.Our findings unveil rarely documented clinical manifestations, notably including Rubinstein-Taybi-like facial features, craniosynostosis, and autoimmune disorders, all manifesting within the realm of BCL11B-RD. We refine the intricacies of T cell compartment alterations of BCL11B-RD, revealing decreased levels naïve CD4+T cells and recent thymic emigrants (RTE) while concurrently observing an elevated proportion of effector-memory expressing CD45RA CD8+T cells (TEMRA). Finally, a distinct DNA methylation episignature exclusive to BCL11B-RD is unveiled.This study serves to enrich our comprehension of the clinico-biological landscape of BCL11B-RD, potentially furnishing a more precise framework for diagnosis and follow-up of individuals carrying pathogenic BCL11B variant. Moreover, the identification of a unique DNA methylation episignature offers a valuable diagnosis tool for BCL11B-RD, thereby facilitating routine clinical practice by empowering physicians to reevaluate variants of uncertain significance within the BCL11B gene.Copyright © 2023.

,37860672,Endoplasmic reticulum stress related genome-wide Mendelian randomization identifies therapeutic genes for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.,Front Genet,"Background:Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) is an important pathophysiological mechanism in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). ERS-related genes may be influenced by genetic factors and intestinal inflammation. However, the role of ERS as a trigger or potential etiological factor for UC and CD is unclear, as the expression of ERS-related genes in UC and CD may be the cause or subsequent changes in intestinal inflammation. Here, we used a three-step summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) approach integrating multi-omics data to identify putative causal effects of ERS-related genes in UC and CD.Methods:Genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data for UC (6,968 cases and 20,464 controls) and CD (5,956 cases and 14,927 controls) were extracted as outcome, and DNA methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL, 1,980 participants) data and expression QTL data (eQTL, 31,684 participants) from the blood were obtained as exposure. The ERS-related genes were extracted from the GeneCards database, and then the GWAS summary data were integrated with the mQTL and eQTL data associated with ERS genes by SMR. Sensitivity analysis included two-sample MR analysis, power calculations, Bayesian co-localization analysis, and phenotype scanning were performed to evaluate the robustness of the results.Results:A total of 1,193 ERS-related genes were obtained. The three-step SMR analysis showed that cg24011261 CpG site regulatingGPX1expression was associated with a low risk of UC, whereasGPX1expression regulated by a combination of cg05055782, cg24011261, and cg05551922 CpG sites was associated with a low risk of CD. Sensitivity analysis further supports these findings.Conclusion:This multi-omics integration study identifies a causal relationship between the role of ERS in UC and CD and suggests potential new therapeutic targets for clinical practice.Copyright © 2023 Zou, Liang, Zhang, Zhu and Xu."
x,37858220,NA,NA,"B vitamins such as folate (B9), B6, and B12 are key in one carbon metabolism, which generates methyl donors for DNA methylation. Several studies have linked differential methylation to self-reported intakes of folate and B12, but these estimates can be imprecise, while metabolomic biomarkers can offer an objective assessment of dietary intakes. We explored blood metabolomic biomarkers of folate and vitamins B6 and B12, to carry out epigenome-wide analyses across up to three European cohorts. Associations between self-reported habitual daily B vitamin intakes and 756 metabolites (Metabolon Inc.) were assessed in serum samples from 1064 UK participants from the TwinsUK cohort. The identified B vitamin metabolomic biomarkers were then used in epigenome-wide association tests with fasting blood DNA methylation levels at 430,768 sites from the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip in blood samples from 2182 European participants from the TwinsUK and KORA cohorts. Candidate signals were explored for metabolite associations with gene expression levels in a subset of the TwinsUK sample (n = 297). Metabolomic biomarker epigenetic associations were also compared with epigenetic associations of self-reported habitual B vitamin intakes in samples from 2294 European participants.Eighteen metabolites were associated with B vitamin intakes after correction for multiple testing (Bonferroni-adj. p < 0.05), of which 7 metabolites were available in both cohorts and tested for epigenome-wide association. Three metabolites - pipecolate (metabolomic biomarker of B6 and folate intakes), pyridoxate (marker of B6 and folate) and docosahexaenoate (DHA, marker of B6) - were associated with 10, 3 and 1 differentially methylated positions (DMPs), respectively. The strongest association was observed between DHA and DMP cg03440556 in the SCD gene (effect = 0.093 ± 0.016, p = 4.07E-09). Pyridoxate, a catabolic product of vitamin B6, was inversely associated with CpG methylation near the SLC1A5 gene promoter region (cg02711608 and cg22304262) and with SLC7A11 (cg06690548), but not with corresponding changes in gene expression levels. The self-reported intake of folate and vitamin B6 had consistent but non-significant associations with the epigenetic signals.Metabolomic biomarkers are a valuable approach to investigate the effects of dietary B vitamin intake on the human epigenome.© 2023.

x,37857414,NA,NA,"Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a highly prevalent childhood disorder. Maternal smoking during pregnancy is a replicated environmental risk factor for this disorder. It is also a robust modifier of gene methylation during the prenatal developmental period. In this study, we sought to identify loci differentially methylated by maternal smoking during pregnancy and relate their methylation levels to various behavioural and physical outcomes relevant to ADHD.We extracted DNA from blood samples from children diagnosed with ADHD and deeply phenotyped. Genome-wide DNA methylation was assessed using Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. Maternal smoking during pregnancy was self-declared and assessed retrospectively.Our sample included 231 children with ADHD. Statistically significant differences in DNA methylation between children exposed or not to maternal smoking during pregnancy were detected in 3457 CpGs. We kept 30 CpGs with at least 5% of methylation difference between the 2 groups for further analysis. Six genes were associated with varied phenotypes of clinical relevance to ADHD. The levels of DNA methylation inRUNX1were positively correlated with the CBCL scores, and DNA methylation inMYO1Gcorrelated positively with the score at the Conners rating scale. Methylation level in a CpG located inGFI1correlated with birthweight, a risk factor for ADHD. Differentially methylated regions were also identified and confirmed the association ofRUNX1methylation levels with the CBCL score.The study has several limitations, including the retrospective recall with self-report of maternal smoking during pregnancy as well as the grouping of individuals of varying age and developmental stage and of both males and females. In addition, the correlation design prevents the building of causation models.This study provides evidence for the association between the level of methylation at specific loci and quantitative dimensions highly relevant for ADHD as well as birth weight, a measure that has already been associated with increased risk for ADHD. Our results provide further support to public health educational initiatives to stop maternal smoking during pregnancy.© 2023 CMA Impact Inc. or its licensors."
,37856503,Transcriptomic analyses of juvenile Striped Bass (Morone saxatilis) exposed to chronic and acute temperature change.,PLoS One,"Striped Bass are economically important, migratory fishes, which occur across a wide range of latitudes. Given their wide-ranging nature, Striped Bass can cope with a broad range of environmental temperatures, yet the mechanisms underlying this ability have not been thoroughly described. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are inducible molecular chaperones, which help mitigate protein damage resulting from increased temperatures. The importance of HSPs has been demonstrated in a number of fish species, but their role in Striped Bass is poorly understood. This study characterizes changes in gene expression in juvenile Striped Bass, following acute and chronic temperature change. Fish were acclimated to one of three temperatures (15, 25 or 30°C) and sampled at one of two treatments (control or after CTmax), following which we assessed differential gene expression and gene ontology in muscle. It is clear from our differential expression analyses that acclimation to warm temperatures elicits more robust changes to gene expression, compared to acute temperature increases. Our differential expression analyses also revealed induction of many different heat shock proteins, including hsp70, hsp90, hsp40 and other small HSPs, after both acute and chronic temperature increase in white muscle. Furthermore, the most consistent gene ontology pattern that emerged following both acclimation and CTmax was upregulation of transcripts involved in ""protein folding"", which also include heat shock proteins. Gene ontology analyses also suggest changes to other processes after acclimation, including decreased growth pathways and changes to DNA methylation. Overall, these data suggest that HSPs likely play a major role in the Striped Bass's ability to tolerate warm waters.Copyright: © 2023 Penny, Pavey.

x,37852258,"A mouse model with high clonal barcode diversity for joint lineage, transcriptomic, and epigenomic profiling in single cells.",Cell,"Cellular lineage histories and their molecular states encode fundamental principles of tissue development and homeostasis. Current lineage-recording mouse models have insufficient barcode diversity and single-cell lineage coverage for profiling tissues composed of millions of cells. Here, we developed DARLIN, an inducible Cas9 barcoding mouse line that utilizes terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and 30 CRISPR target sites. DARLIN is inducible, generates massive lineage barcodes across tissues, and enables the detection of edited barcodes in ∼70% of profiled single cells. Using DARLIN, we examined fate bias within developing hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and revealed unique features of HSC migration. Additionally, we established a protocol for joint transcriptomic and epigenomic single-cell measurements with DARLIN and found that cellular clonal memory is associated with genome-wide DNA methylation rather than gene expression or chromatin accessibility. DARLIN will enable the high-resolution study of lineage relationships and their molecular signatures in diverse tissues and physiological contexts.Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier Inc."
,37849386,Cotranscriptional demethylation induces global loss of H3K4me2 from active genes in Arabidopsis.,EMBO J,"Based on studies of animals and yeasts, methylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me1/2/3, for mono-, di-, and tri-methylation, respectively) is regarded as the key epigenetic modification of transcriptionally active genes. In plants, however, H3K4me2 correlates negatively with transcription, and the regulatory mechanisms of this counterintuitive H3K4me2 distribution in plants remain largely unexplored. A previous genetic screen for factors regulating plant regeneration identified Arabidopsis LYSINE-SPECIFIC DEMETHYLASE 1-LIKE 3 (LDL3), which is a major H3K4me2 demethylase. Here, we show that LDL3-mediated H3K4me2 demethylation depends on the transcription elongation factor Paf1C and phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). In addition, LDL3 binds to phosphorylated RNAPII. These results suggest that LDL3 is recruited to transcribed genes by binding to elongating RNAPII and demethylates H3K4me2 cotranscriptionally. Importantly, the negative correlation between H3K4me2 and transcription is significantly attenuated in the ldl3 mutant, demonstrating the genome-wide impacts of the transcription-driven LDL3 pathway to control H3K4me2 in plants. Our findings implicate H3K4me2 demethylation in plants as chromatin records of transcriptional activity, which ensures robust gene control.© 2023 The Authors.

To gain a better understanding of the link between epigenetics (DNA methylation) and AS/PH, we examined the relationship of eight measures of AS/PH with CpG sites and co-methylated regions using multi-ancestry participants from Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) with sample sizes ranging from 438 to 874. Epigenome-wide association analysis identified one genome-wide significant CpG (cg20711926-CYP1B1) associated with aortic augmentation index (AIx). Follow-up analyses, including gene set enrichment analysis, expression quantitative trait methylation analysis, and functional enrichment analysis on differentially methylated positions and regions, further prioritized three CpGs and their annotated genes (cg23800023-ETS1, cg08426368-TGFB3, and cg17350632-HLA-DPB1) for AIx. Among these, ETS1 and TGFB3 have been previously prioritized as candidate genes. Furthermore, both ETS1 and HLA-DPB1 have significant tissue correlations between Whole Blood and Aorta in GTEx, which suggests ETS1 and HLA-DPB1 could be potential biomarkers in understanding pathophysiology of AS/PH. Overall, our findings support the possible role of epigenetic regulation via DNA methylation of specific genes associated with AIx as well as identifying potential targets for regulation of AS/PH.© 2023.

,37845773,NA,NA,"Vitamin C (vitC) enhances the activity of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, including TET enzymes, which catalyse DNA demethylation, and Jumonji-domain histone demethylases. The epigenetic remodelling promoted by vitC improves the efficiency of induced pluripotent stem cell derivation, and is required to attain a ground-state of pluripotency in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) that closely mimics the inner cell mass of the early blastocyst. However, genome-wide DNA and histone demethylation can lead to upregulation of transposable elements (TEs), and it is not known how vitC addition in culture media affects TE expression in pluripotent stem cells.Here we show that vitC increases the expression of several TE families, including evolutionarily young LINE-1 (L1) elements, in mouse ESCs. We find that TET activity is dispensable for L1 upregulation, and that instead it occurs largely as a result of H3K9me3 loss mediated by KDM4A/C histone demethylases. Despite increased L1 levels, we did not detect increased somatic insertion rates in vitC-treated cells. Notably, treatment of human ESCs with vitC also increases L1 protein levels, albeit through a distinct, post-transcriptional mechanism.VitC directly modulates the expression of mouse L1s and other TEs through epigenetic mechanisms, with potential for downstream effects related to the multiple emerging roles of L1s in cellular function.© 2023.

Psychosocial stressors may also have intergenerational health effects by which parental ACEs are associated with mental and physical health of children. Epigenetic programming may be one mechanism linking parental ACEs to child health. This study aimed to investigate epigenome-wide associations of maternal preconception ACEs with DNA methylation patterns of children. In the Center for the Health Assessment of Mothers and Children of Salinas study, cord blood DNA methylation was measured using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Preconception ACEs, which occurred during the mothers' childhoods, were collected using a standard ACE questionnaire including 10 ACE indicators. Maternal ACE exposures were defined in this study as (1) the total number of ACEs; (2) the total number of ACEs categorized as 0, 1-3, and > 4; and (3) individual ACEs. Associations of ACE exposures with differential methylated positions, regions, and CpG modules determined using weighted gene co-expression network analysis were evaluated adjusting for covariates.Data on maternal ACEs and cord blood DNA methylation were available for 196 mother/newborn pairs. One differential methylated position was associated with maternal experience of emotional abuse (cg05486260/FAM135B gene; q value < 0.05). Five differential methylated regions were significantly associated with the total number of ACEs, and 36 unique differential methylated regions were associated with individual ACEs (Šidák p value < 0.05). Fifteen CpG modules were significantly correlated with the total number of ACEs or individual ACEs, of which 8 remained significant in fully adjusted models (p value < 0.05). Significant modules were enriched for pathways related to neurological and immune development and function.Maternal ACEs prior to conception were associated with cord blood DNA methylation of offspring at birth. Although there was limited overlap between differential methylated regions and CpGs in modules associated with ACE exposures, statistically significant regions and networks were related to genes involved in neurological and immune function. Findings may provide insights to pathways linking psychosocial stressors to health.

,37844765,Methyl donor diet attenuates intimal hyperplasia after vascular injury in rats.,J Nutr Biochem,"Environmental factors, particularly dietary habits, play an important role in cardiovascular disease susceptibility and progression through epigenetic modification. Previous studies have shown that hyperplastic vascular intima after endarterectomy is characterized by genome-wide hypomethylation. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether methyl donor diet affects intimal hyperplasia and the possible mechanisms involved. Intimal hyperplasia was induced in SD rats by carotid artery balloon injury. From 8 days before surgery to 28 days after surgery, the animals were fed a normal diet (ND) or a methyl donor diet (MD) supplemented with folic acid, vitamin B12, choline, betaine, and zinc. Carotid artery intimal hyperplasia was observed by histology, the effect of MD on carotid protein expression was analyzed by proteomics, functional clustering, signaling pathway, and upstream-downstream relationship of differentially expressed proteins were analyzed by bioinformatics. Results showed that MD attenuated balloon injury-induced intimal hyperplasia in rat carotid arteries. Proteomic analysis showed that there were many differentially expressed proteins in the common carotid arteries of rats fed with two different diets. The differentially expressed proteins are mainly related to the composition and function of the extracellular matrix (EMC), and changes in the EMC can lead to vascular remodeling by affecting fibrosis and stiffness of the blood vessel wall. Changes in the levels of vasculotropic proteins such as S100A9, ILF3, Serpinh1, Fbln5, LOX, HSPG2 and Fmod may be the reason why MD attenuates intimal hyperplasia. Supplementation with methyl donor nutrients may be a beneficial measure to prevent pathological vascular remodeling after injury.Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier Inc."
x,37844693,An epigenome-wide association study of child appetitive traits and DNA methylation.,Appetite,"The etiology of childhood appetitive traits is poorly understood. Early-life epigenetic processes may be involved in the developmental programming of appetite regulation in childhood. One such process is DNA methylation (DNAm), whereby a methyl group is added to a specific part of DNA, where a cytosine base is next to a guanine base, a CpG site. We meta-analyzed epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) of cord blood DNAm and early-childhood appetitive traits. Data were from two independent cohorts: the Generation R Study (n = 1,086, Rotterdam, the Netherlands) and the Healthy Start study (n = 236, Colorado, USA). DNAm at autosomal methylation sites in cord blood was measured using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Parents reported on their child's food responsiveness, emotional undereating, satiety responsiveness and food fussiness using the Children's Eating Behaviour Questionnaire at age 4-5 years. Multiple regression models were used to examine the association of DNAm (predictor) at the individual site- and regional-level (using DMRff) with each appetitive trait (outcome), adjusting for covariates. Bonferroni-correction was applied to adjust for multiple testing. There were no associations of DNAm and any appetitive trait when examining individual CpG-sites. However, when examining multiple CpGs jointly in so-called differentially methylated regions, we identified 45 associations of DNAm with food responsiveness, 7 associations of DNAm with emotional undereating, 13 associations of DNAm with satiety responsiveness, and 9 associations of DNAm with food fussiness. This study shows that DNAm in the newborn may partially explain variation in appetitive traits expressed in early childhood and provides preliminary support for early programming of child appetitive traits through DNAm. Investigating differential DNAm associated with appetitive traits could be an important first step in identifying biological pathways underlying the development of these behaviors.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

Here, we describe 40 individuals from 30 families withde novoor maternally inherited pathogenic variants inSMARCA1. This novel NDD was associated with mild to severe ID/DD, delayed or regressive speech development, and some recurrent facial dysmorphisms. Individuals carryingSMARCA1loss-of-function variants exhibited a mild genome-wide DNA methylation profile and a high penetrance of macrocephaly. Genetic dissection of the NURF complex usingSmarca1, Smarca5, andBptfsingleand double mouse knockouts revealed the importance of NURF composition and dosage for proper forebrain development.

We have proposed an arthroscopic technique of dorsal capsulodesis with good clinical results. We now propose a radiological follow-up.Purpose To determine if arthroscopic dorsal capsulodesis can improve the radiographic SL angle and maintain this correction over time.Methods From January 2020 to January 2021, we included every patient with an SL instability and sorted them according to the European Wrist Arthroscopy Society (EWAS) classification. All patients had bilateral X-rays with a measurement of the radiolunate (RL) and SL angles for both the pathologic and healthy side. We also included patients with lunotriquetral or triangular fibrocartilage complex lesions. The exclusion criteria were the presence of arthritis and persistent intraoperative SL instability after capsulodesis. An arthroscopic dorsal capsulodesis was performed in all patients as originally described by Mathoulin. The RL and SL angles were then again measured on the immediate postoperative X-ray, and then again at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. The statistical analysis was done using a paired Student'st-test with 145 degrees of freedom and α = 0.05.Results We included a total of 146 patients with a 1-year follow-up. Both the RL angle and the SL angles approach the healthy side at 12 months postoperatively. The RL angle has increased from -7.23 degrees to 4.37 degrees; the difference is still statistically significative, but it is almost equal to the healthy side (5.16 degrees). The SL angle has lowered from 74.55 to 54.95; the difference is still statistically and radiologically significative (6.788 degrees) but has been lowered by 74.3%.Conclusion This study shows that this technique can normalize the dorsal intercalated segment instability (DISI) over time without the need for any pinning or invasive ligament reconstructive surgery.Level of Evidence Level IV, cohort study.Clinical Relevance Dorsal capsulodesis should be considered in all reducible SL injuries, even when DISI is present.Thieme.

,37840067,Involvement of CCCTC-binding factor in epigenetic regulation of cancer.,Mol Biol Rep,"A major global health burden continues to be borne by the complex and multifaceted disease of cancer. Epigenetic changes, which are essential for the emergence and spread of cancer, have drawn a huge amount of attention recently. The CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), which takes part in a wide range of cellular processes including genomic imprinting, X chromosome inactivation, 3D chromatin architecture, local modifications of histone, and RNA polymerase II-mediated gene transcription, stands out among the diverse array of epigenetic regulators. CTCF not only functions as an architectural protein but also modulates DNA methylation and histone modifications. Epigenetic regulation of cancer has already been the focus of plenty of studies. Understanding the role of CTCF in the cancer epigenetic landscape may lead to the development of novel targeted therapeutic strategies for cancer. CTCF has already earned its status as a tumor suppressor gene by acting like a homeostatic regulator of genome integrity and function. Moreover, CTCF has a direct effect on many important transcriptional regulators that control the cell cycle, apoptosis, senescence, and differentiation. As we learn more about CTCF-mediated epigenetic modifications and transcriptional regulations, the possibility of utilizing CTCF as a diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for cancer will also increase. Thus, the current review intends to promote personalized and precision-based therapeutics for cancer patients by shedding light on the complex interplay between CTCF and epigenetic processes.© 2023.

CNS tumors are the most common solid tumors in children, and their prognosis remains poor. This study retrospectively analyzed pediatric patients with CNS embryonal tumors in Hong Kong between 1999 and 2017, using data from the territory-wide registry and available formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue. After processing archival tumor tissue via DNA extraction, quantification, and methylation profiling, the data were analyzed by using the web-based DKFZ classifier (Molecular Neuropathology (MNP) 2.0 v11b4) and t-SNE analysis. Methylation profiles were deemed informative in 85 samples. Epigenetic data allowed molecular subgrouping and confirmed diagnosis in 65 samples, verified histologic diagnosis in 8, and suggested an alternative diagnosis in 12. This study demonstrates the potential of DNA methylation profiling in characterizing pediatric CNS embryonal tumors in a large cohort from Hong Kong, which should enable regional and international collaboration in future pediatric neuro-oncology research."

This study aimed to explore the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) specific to cell types in sepsis and investigate the role of resistin in the survival of sepsis patients through Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses. We used single-cell and bulk transcriptome data to identify cell type-specific DEGs between sepsis and healthy controls. MR analyses were then conducted to investigate the causal relationships between resistin (one of the identified DEGs) levels and the survival of sepsis patients. Additionally, we utilized meQTL (methylation quantitative trait loci) to identify cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites that may directly affect sepsis. We identified 560 cell type-specific DEGs between sepsis and healthy controls. Notably, we observed the upregulation of resistin levels in macrophages during sepsis. In bulk transcriptome, RETN is also upregulated in sepsis samples compared with healthy controls. MR analyses revealed a negative association existed between the expression of resistin, at both gene and protein levels, and the mortality or severity of sepsis patients in ICU. Moreover, there were no associations observed between resistin levels and death or organ failure due to other causes. We also identified three methylation CpG sites, located in RETN or its promoter region-cg06633066, cg22322184, and cg02346997-that directly affected both resistin protein levels and sepsis death in the ICU. Our findings suggest that resistin may provide feasible protection for sepsis patients, particularly those with severe cases, without serious side effects. Therefore, resistin could be a potential drug candidate for sepsis treatment. Additionally, we identified two CpG sites, cg06633066 and cg22322184, that were associated with RETN protein levels and sepsis death, providing novel insights into the underlying mechanisms of sepsis."
,37834223,NA,NA,"Little is known about the potential role of epigenetic marks as predictors of the resolution of obesity-related comorbidities after bariatric surgery. In this study, 20 patients were classified according to the metabolic improvement observed 6 months after sleeve gastrectomy, based on the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome, into responders if metabolic syndrome reversed after bariatric surgery (n= 10) and non-responders if they had metabolic syndrome bariatric surgery (n= 10). Blood DNA methylation was analyzed at both study points using the Infinium Methylation EPIC Bead Chip array-based platform. Twenty-six CpG sites and their annotated genes, which were previously described to be associated with metabolic status, were evaluated. Cg11445109 and cg19469447 (annotated to Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) gene) were significantly more hypomethylated in the responder group than in the non-responder group at both study points, whilst cg25828445 (annotated to Nucleolar Protein Interacting With The FHA Domain Of MKI67 Pseudogene 3 (NIFKP3) gene) showed to be significantly more hypermethylated in the non-responder group compared to the responder group at both study points. The analysis of the methylation sites annotated to the associated genes showed thatCYP2E1had 40% of the differentially methylated CpG sites, followed by Major Histocompatibility Complex, Class II, DR Beta 1 (HLA-DRB1) (33.33%) and Zinc Finger Protein, FOG Family Member 2 (ZFPM2) (26.83%). Cg11445109, cg19469447 and cg25828445 could have a role in the prediction of metabolic status and potential value as biomarkers of response to bariatric surgery."

Consequently, identifying the extent of longitudinal, inter-tissue, and inter-platform variation in DNA methylation is crucial for future advancement. DNA methylation was measured in 375 individuals, with 197 of those having 2 blood sample measurements ~10 years apart. Whole-blood samples were measured on Illumina Infinium 450K and EPIC methylation arrays, and buccal samples from a subset of 58 participants were measured on EPIC array. The data were analyzed with the aims to examine the correlation between methylation levels in longitudinal blood samples in 197 individuals, examine the correlation between methylation levels in the blood and buccal samples in 58 individuals, and examine the correlation between blood methylation profiles assessed on the EPIC and 450K arrays in 83 individuals. We identified 136,833, 7674, and 96,891 CpGs significantly and strongly correlated (>0.50) longitudinally, across blood and buccal samples as well as array platforms, respectively. A total of 3674 of these CpGs were shared across all three sets. Analysis of these shared CpGs identified previously found associations with aging, ancestry, and 7016 mQTLs as well."
,37833512,Cross species review of the physiological role of D-serine in translationally relevant behaviors.,Amino Acids,"Bridging the gap between preclinical models of neurological and psychiatric disorders with their human manifestations is necessary to understand their underlying mechanisms, identify biomarkers, and develop novel therapeutics. Cognitive and social impairments underlie multiple neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders and are often comorbid with sleep disturbances, which can exacerbate poor outcomes. Importantly, many symptoms are conserved between vertebrates and invertebrates, although they may have subtle differences. Therefore, it is essential to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying these behaviors across different species and their translatability to humans. Genome-wide association studies have indicated an association between glutamatergic gene variants and both the risk and frequency of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism spectrum disorder. For example, changes in glutamatergic neurotransmission, such as glutamate receptor subtype N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) hypofunction, have been shown to contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Furthermore, in neurological disorders, such as traumatic brain injury and Alzheimer's disease, hyperactivation of NMDARs leads to synaptic damage. In addition to glutamate binding, NMDARs require the binding of a co-agonist D-serine or glycine to the GluN1 subunit to open. D-serine, which is racemized from L-serine by the neuronal enzyme serine racemase (SRR), and both SRR and D-serine are enriched in cortico-limbic brain regions. D-serine is critical for complex behaviors, such as cognition and social behavior, where dysregulation of its synthesis and release has been implicated in many pathological conditions. In this review, we explore the role of D-serine in behaviors that are translationally relevant to multiple psychiatric and neurological disorders in different models across species.© 2023.

,37832188,Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance and immunity in chickens that vary in Marek's disease resistance.,Poult Sci,"Marek's disease virus (MDV), a naturally oncogenic, highly contagious alpha herpesvirus, induces a T cell lymphoma in chickens that causes severe economic loss. Marek's disease (MD) outcome in an individual is attributed to genetic and environmental factors. Further investigation of the host-virus interaction mechanisms that impact MD resistance is needed to achieve greater MD control. This study analyzed genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in 2 highly inbred parental lines 63and 72and 5 recombinant congenic strains (RCS) C, L, M, N, and X strains from those parents. Lines 63and 72, are MD resistant and susceptible, respectively, whereas the RCS have different combinations of 87.5% Line 63and 12.5% Line 72. Our DNA methylation cluster showed a strong association with MD incidence. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between the parental lines and the 5 RCS were captured. MD-resistant and MD-susceptible markers of DNA methylation were identified as transgenerational epigenetic inheritable. In addition, the growth of v-src DNA tumors and antibody response against sheep red blood cells differed among the 2 parental lines and the RCS. Overall, our results provide very solid evidence that DNA methylation patterns are transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (TEI) in chickens and also play a vital role in MD tumorigenesis and other immune responses; the specific methylated regions may be important modulators of general immunity.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

,37831064,Chromatin and gene expression changes during female Drosophila germline stem cell development illuminate the biology of highly potent stem cells.,Elife,"Highly potent animal stem cells either self renew or launch complex differentiation programs, using mechanisms that are only partly understood.Drosophilafemale germline stem cells (GSCs) perpetuate without change over evolutionary time and generate cystoblast daughters that develop into nurse cells and oocytes. Cystoblasts initiate differentiation by generating a transient syncytial state, the germline cyst, and by increasing pericentromeric H3K9me3 modification, actions likely to suppress transposable element activity. Relatively open GSC chromatin is further restricted by Polycomb repression of testis or somatic cell-expressed genes briefly active in early female germ cells. Subsequently, Neijre/CBP and Myc help upregulate growth and reprogram GSC metabolism by altering mitochondrial transmembrane transport, gluconeogenesis, and other processes. In all these respects GSC differentiation resembles development of the totipotent zygote. We propose that the totipotent stem cell state was shaped by the need to resist transposon activity over evolutionary timescales.© 2023, Pang et al."

Different bioinformatic and experimental analyses were performed for biological exploration.By analyzing discovery sets with radiotherapy (RT) plus TMZ versus RT alone, we identified a panel of 64 TMZ efficacy-related CpGs, from which a 10-CpG risk signature was further constructed. Both the 64-CpG panel and the 10-CpG risk signature were validated showing significant correlations with overall survival of G-CIMP-/unMGMT GBMs when treated with RT/TMZ, rather than RT alone. The 10-CpG risk signature was further observed for aiding TMZ choice by distinguishing differential outcomes to RT/TMZ versus RT within each risk subgroup. Functional studies on GPR81, the gene harboring one of the 10 CpGs, indicated its distinct impacts on TMZ resistance in GBM cells, which may be dependent on the status of MGMT expression.The 64 TMZ efficacy-related CpGs and in particular the 10-CpG risk signature may serve as promising predictive biomarker candidates for guiding optimal usage of TMZ in G-CIMP-/unMGMT GBMs.© 2023 The Authors.

Whole genome DNA methylation patterns were profiled by the Infinium human MethylationEPIC platform with >850 K DNA methylation loci. Two external datasets were used for comparisons and qRT-PCR was performed for examining expression of associated genes of those identified DNA methylation loci.Results:We detected 194 loci that are significantly differentially methylated after AngII treatment, and 206 significant loci after IGF-1 treatment. Mapping the significant loci to genes, we identified 158 genes corresponding to AngII treatment and 175 genes to IGF-1 treatment. Using the gene-set enrichment analysis, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway was identified to be significantly enriched for both AngII and IGF-1 treatment. The Hippo signaling pathway was enriched after IGF-1 treatment, but not for AngII treatment.CDK6andRPTORare components of the PI3K-Akt pathway but have different DNA methylation patterns in response to AngII and IGF-1. qRT-PCR confirmed the different gene expressions ofCDK6andPRTOR.Conclusion:Our study is pioneering in profiling epigenome DNA methylation changes in adult human cardiomyocytes under distinct stress conditions: pathological (AngII) and physiological (IGF-1). The identified DNA methylation loci, genes, and pathways might have the potential to distinguish between pathological and physiological cardiac hypertrophy.Copyright © 2023 Shi, Chen, Meng, Ossip, Yan and Li."

Although resistant soybean genotypes have been identified, the genetic mechanisms underlying target spot resistance has not yet been studied. To address this knowledge gap, this is the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) conducted using the SoySNP50K array on a panel of 246 soybean accessions, aiming to unravel the genetic architecture of resistance. The results revealed significant associations of 14 and 33 loci with resistance to LIM01 and SSTAC. cassiicolaisolates, respectively, with six loci demonstrating consistent associations across both isolates. To identify potential candidate genes within GWAS-identified loci, dynamic transcriptome profiling was conducted through RNA-Seq analysis. The analysis involved comparing gene expression patterns between resistant and susceptible genotypes, utilizing leaf tissue collected at different time points after inoculation. Integrating results of GWAS and RNA-Seq analyses identified 238 differentially expressed genes within a 200 kb region encompassing significant quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for disease severity ratings. These genes were involved in defense response to pathogen, innate immune response, chitinase activity, histone H3-K9 methylation, salicylic acid mediated signaling pathway, kinase activity, and biosynthesis of flavonoid, jasmonic acid, phenylpropanoid, and wax. In addition, when combining results from this study with previous GWAS research, 11 colocalized regions associated with disease resistance were identified for biotic and abiotic stress. This finding provides valuable insight into the genetic resources that can be harnessed for future breeding programs aiming to enhance soybean resistance against target spot and other diseases simultaneously.Copyright © 2023 Patel, Patel, Bowen and Koebernick."
,37828247,NA,NA,"Trypanosomes are eukaryotic, unicellular parasites, such as Trypanosoma brucei, which causes sleeping sickness, and Trypanosoma cruzi, which causes Chagas disease. Genomes of these parasites comprise core regions and species-specific disruptive regions that encode multigene families of surface glycoproteins. Few transcriptional regulators have been identified in these parasites, and the role of spatial organization of the genome in gene expression is unclear. Here we mapped genome-wide chromatin interactions in T. cruzi using chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C), and we show that the core and disruptive regions form three-dimensional chromatin compartments named C and D. These chromatin compartments differ in levels of DNA methylation, nucleosome positioning and chromatin interactions, affecting genome expression dynamics. Our data reveal that the trypanosome genome is organized into chromatin-folding domains and transcription is affected by the local chromatin structure. We propose a model in which epigenetic mechanisms affect gene expression in trypanosomes.© 2023. The Author(s)."
,37827482,A Systematic Review of Genome Wide Analyses of Methylation Changes Associated with Assisted Reproductive Technologies in Various Tissues.,Fertil Steril,"As analytic technologies improve, increasing amounts of data on methylation differences between assisted reproductive technology (ART) and unassisted conceptions are available. However, various studies utilize different tissue types and different populations in their analyses, making comparing and integrating the data difficult.The objective of this systematic review is to compare and integrate data of genome wide analyses of methylation differences due to ART, allowing for exposure of overarching themes.All studies undertaking genome wide analysis of human methylation differences due to ART or infertility in any tissue type across the lifespan were assessed for inclusion.Seventeen studies were identified that met inclusion criteria. One study assessed trophectoderm biopsies, two first trimester placenta, one first trimester fetal tissue, two term placenta, seven cord blood, three newborn dried blood spots, one childhood buccal smears, one childhood peripheral blood, and two adult peripheral blood. Eleven studies compared tissues from in vitro fertilization (IVF) conceptions to unassisted conceptions, four compared ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection) to unassisted, four non-IVF fertility treatment (NIFT) to unassisted, four NIFT to IVF, and five compared an infertile population (conceiving via various methods) to an unassisted presumably fertile population. In studies assessing placental tissue, one gene with potential methylation changes due to IVF when compared to unassisted was identified by two studies. In blood, eleven potential genes with methylation changes in IVF compared to unassisted were identified by two studies, one of which was identified by three studies. Three potentially affected genes were identified by two studies in blood between ICSI and unassisted populations. There were no overlapping genes identified in any tissue type between NIFT and unassisted populations, between NIFT and IVF, or the infertility combined population when compared to the unassisted fertile population.Comparing studies is challenging due to differing variables between analyses. However, even in similar tissue types and populations, overlapping methylation changes are limited, suggesting differences due to ART are minimal.Information from this systematic review is significant for providers and patients who provide and utilize ART to understand methylation risks that may be associated with the technology.Copyright © 2023.

Some studies have shown that the expressions of some m6A-related genes are significantly regulated by single nucleotide variants (SNV). However, the function of m6A-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (m6A-SNP) remains unclear in multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we identified the disease-associated m6A-SNPs by integrating genome-wide association study (GWAS) and m6A-SNPs from the RMVar database, and confirmed the relationship between these identified m6A-SNPs and their target genes in eQTL analysis and gene differential expression analysis. Finally, 26 genes corresponding to 20 m6A-SNPs with eQTL signals were identified and differentially expressed (P < 0.05) in MS, 15 genes corresponding to 12 m6A-SNPs (P < 1e-04) were differentially expressed in AD, and 27 PD-associated m6A-SNPs that regulated the expression of 31 genes were identified. There were 5 HLA genes with eQTL signals (HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQA2 and HLA-DQB1-AS1) to be detected in the three diseases. In summary, our study provided new insights into understanding the potential roles of these m6A-SNPs in disease pathogenesis as well as therapeutic target.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

,37824527,A nonequilibrium allosteric model for receptor-kinase complexes: The role of energy dissipation in chemotaxis signaling.,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"TheEscherichia colichemotaxis signaling pathway has served as a model system for the adaptive sensing of environmental signals by large protein complexes. The chemoreceptors control the kinase activity of CheA in response to the extracellular ligand concentration and adapt across a wide concentration range by undergoing methylation and demethylation. Methylation shifts the kinase response curve by orders of magnitude in ligand concentration while incurring a much smaller change in the ligand binding curve. Here, we show that the disproportionate shift in binding and kinase response is inconsistent with equilibrium allosteric models. To resolve this inconsistency, we present a nonequilibrium allosteric model that explicitly includes the dissipative reaction cycles driven by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis. The model successfully explains all existing joint measurements of ligand binding, receptor conformation, and kinase activity for both aspartate and serine receptors. Our results suggest that the receptor complex acts as an enzyme: Receptor methylation modulates the ON-state kinetics of the kinase (e.g., phosphorylation rate), while ligand binding controls the equilibrium balance between kinase ON/OFF states. Furthermore, sufficient energy dissipation is responsible for maintaining and enhancing the sensitivity range and amplitude of the kinase response. We demonstrate that the nonequilibrium allosteric model is broadly applicable to other sensor-kinase systems by successfully fitting previously unexplained data from the DosP bacterial oxygen-sensing system. Overall, this work provides a nonequilibrium physics perspective on cooperative sensing by large protein complexes and opens up research directions for understanding their microscopic mechanisms through simultaneous measurements and modeling of ligand binding and downstream responses."
,37822338,Genome-wide identification of the AOMT gene family in wax apple and functional characterization of SsAOMTs to anthocyanin methylation.,Front Plant Sci,"Anthocyanins are major pigments in the peels of red-series wax apple fruits, and two principal components of them, namely, the cyanin and the peonidin, are non-methoxylated and methoxylated anthocyanins, respectively. Anthocyanin O-methyltransferases (AOMTs) are an important group of enzymes that have the ability to catalyze anthocyanins methylation to promote the solubility, stability, and bioactivity of anthocyanins. Although AOMT genes have been studied in a variety of plants, the function of them in wax apple is generally not well understood.The anthocyanin composition in peels of two wax apple cultivars was determined by High Performance Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry (HPLS-MS). The genome-wide analysis of the AOMT genes was performed with bioinformatics technology, and the expression patterns of different plant tissues, cultivars, fruit ripening stages, and exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) treatments were analyzed by transcriptome sequencing analysis and real-time quantitative PCR verification. An initial functional evaluation was carried outin vitrousing recombinant the Anthocyanin O-methyltransferase Gene 5 of S. samarangense (SsAOMT5) protein.Only two main compositions of anthocyanin were found in peels of two wax apple cultivars, and it was worth noting that Tub Ting Jiang cultivar contained non-methoxylated anthocyanin (Cy3G) only, whereas Daye cultivar contained both non-methoxylated and methoxylated (Pn3G) anthocyanins. A total of six SsAOMT genes were identified in the whole genome of wax apple, randomly distributing on three chromosomes. A phylogenic analysis of the protein sequences divided the SsAOMT gene family into three subgroups, and all SsAOMTs had highly conserved domains of AOMT family. In total, four types of stress- related and five types of hormone- related cis-elements were discovered in the promoter region of theSsAOMTs. Expression pattern analysis showed thatSsAOMT5andSsAOMT6were expressed in all tissues to varying degrees; notably, the expression ofSsAOMT5was high in the flower and fruit and significantly higher in Daye peels than those of other cultivars in the fruit ripening period. Exogenous ABA treatment significantly increased anthocyanin accumulation, but the increase of methoxylated anthocyanin content did not reach significant level compared with those without ABA treatment, whereas the expression ofSsAOMT5upregulated under ABA treatment. We identified two homologousSsAOMT5genes from Daye cultivar (DSsAOMT5) and Tub Ting Jiang cultivar (TSsAOMT5); the results of functional analyses to two SsAOMT5 recombinant proteinsin vitrodemonstrated thatDSsAOMT5showed methylation modification activity, butTSsAOMT5did not.In conclusion, SsAOMT5 was responsible for methylated anthocyanin accumulation in the peels of wax apple and played an important role in red coloration in wax apple peels.Copyright © 2023 Wei, Li, Xu, Zeng and Xu."

However, little is known about the m6A methylome at a transcriptome-wide scale in AML patients. We obtained three pairs of bone marrow (BM) samples from cytogenetically normal AML patients at the timepoints of diagnosis (AML) and relapse (R_AML) and three BM samples from healthy donors used as normal controls (NCs). Methylated RNA immunoprecipitation next-generation sequencing (MeRIP-Seq) was conducted to identify differences in the m6A methylomes between AML and NC and between R_AML and AML. We identified a total of 11,076 and 11,962 differential m6A peaks in AML and R_AML group, respectively. These dysregulated m6A peaks were detected on all chromosomes, especially chr1, chr19 and chr17, and were mainly enriched in 3' untranslated regions, stop codon and coding sequence regions. Moreover, GO and KEGG analyses indicated that m6A -modified genes were significantly enriched in cancer-related biological functions and pathways. Additionally, we identified a link between the m6A methylome and RNA transcriptome via combined analyses of MeRIP-seq and RNA-seq data. In addition, 5 genes, HSPG2, HOMER3, TSPO2, CXCL12 and FUT1 regulated by m6A modification potentially, were shown to be related to the prognosis of AML patients. Additionally, we detected the mRNA expression of major m6A regulators and potential target mRNA on the leukemogenesis and found that the expression of IGF2BP2, HSPG2 and HOMER3 were upregulated in AML at the time of diagnosis. Moreover, their expression became downregulated after remission and then elevated again at relapse. Our study provides the first data on the differential m6A methylome in AML patients during initial diagnosis and relapse. This study demonstrates a novel relationship between m6A modification and AML relapse and paves the way for further studies aimed at elucidating the epigenic mechanisms involved in the relapse of AML.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

,37819607,Succinate dehydrogenase is essential for epigenetic and metabolic homeostasis in hearts.,Basic Res Cardiol,"A hallmark of heart failure is a metabolic switch away from fatty acids β-oxidation (FAO) to glycolysis. Here, we show that succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) is required for maintenance of myocardial homeostasis of FAO/glycolysis. Mice with cardiomyocyte-restricted deletion of subunit b or c of SDH developed a dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Hypertrophied hearts displayed a decrease in FAO, while glucose uptake and glycolysis were augmented, which was reversed by enforcing FAO fuels via a high-fat diet, which also improved heart failure of mutant mice. SDH-deficient hearts exhibited an increase in genome-wide DNA methylation associated with accumulation of succinate, a metabolite known to inhibit DNA demethylases, resulting in changes of myocardial transcriptomic landscape. Succinate induced DNA hypermethylation and depressed the expression of FAO genes in myocardium, leading to imbalanced FAO/glycolysis. Inhibition of succinate by α-ketoglutarate restored transcriptional profiles and metabolic disorders in SDH-deficient cardiomyocytes. Thus, our findings reveal the essential role for SDH in metabolic remodeling of failing hearts, and highlight the potential of therapeutic strategies to prevent cardiac dysfunction in the setting of SDH deficiency.© 2023.

,37819541,NA,NA,"Enormous progress has been made in understanding the genetic architecture of obesity and the correlation of epigenetic marks with obesity and related traits. This review highlights current research and its challenges in genetics and epigenetics of obesity.Recent progress in genetics of polygenic traits, particularly represented by genome-wide association studies, led to the discovery of hundreds of genetic variants associated with obesity, which allows constructing polygenic risk scores (PGS). In addition, epigenome-wide association studies helped identifying novel targets and methylation sites being important in the pathophysiology of obesity and which are essential for the generation of methylation risk scores (MRS). Despite their great potential for predicting the individual risk for obesity, the use of PGS and MRS remains challenging. Future research will likely discover more loci being involved in obesity, which will contribute to better understanding of the complex etiology of human obesity. The ultimate goal from a clinical perspective will be generating highly robust and accurate prediction scores allowing clinicians to predict obesity as well as individual responses to body weight loss-specific life-style interventions.© 2023.

To address these challenges, published assays to date demanded a very high-depth sequencing, resulting in an elevated price of test. Herein, we developed a multimodal assay called SPOT-MAS (screening for the presence of tumor by methylation and size) to simultaneously profile methylomics, fragmentomics, copy number, and end motifs in a single workflow using targeted and shallow genome-wide sequencing (~0.55×) of cell-free DNA. We applied SPOT-MAS to 738 non-metastatic patients with breast, colorectal, gastric, lung, and liver cancer, and 1550 healthy controls. We then employed machine learning to extract multiple cancer and tissue-specific signatures for detecting and locating cancer. SPOT-MAS successfully detected the five cancer types with a sensitivity of 72.4% at 97.0% specificity. The sensitivities for detecting early-stage cancers were 73.9% and 62.3% for stages I and II, respectively, increasing to 88.3% for non-metastatic stage IIIA. For tumor-of-origin, our assay achieved an accuracy of 0.7. Our study demonstrates comparable performance to other ctDNA-based assays while requiring significantly lower sequencing depth, making it economically feasible for population-wide screening.© 2023, Nguyen, Nguyen et al."
,37816049,The lack of negative association between TE load and subgenome dominance in synthesized Brassica allotetraploids.,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Polyploidization is important to the evolution of plants. Subgenome dominance is a distinct phenomenon associated with most allopolyploids. A gene on the dominant subgenome tends to express to higher RNA levels in all organs as compared to the expression of its syntenic paralogue (homoeolog). The mechanism that underlies the formation of subgenome dominance remains unknown, but there is evidence for the involvement of transposon/DNA methylation density differences nearby the genes of parents as being causal. The subgenome with lower density of transposon and methylation near genes is positively associated with subgenome dominance. Here, we generated eight generations of allotetraploid progenies from the merging of parental genomesBrassica rapaandBrassica oleracea. We found that transposon/methylation density differ near genes between the parental (rapa:oleracea) existed in the wide hybrid, persisted in the neotetraploids (the syntheticBrassica napus), but these neotetraploids expressed no expected subgenome dominance. This absence ofB. rapavs.B. oleraceasubgenome dominance is particularly significant because, while there is no negative relationship between transposon/methylation level and subgenome dominance in the neotetraploids, the more ancient parental subgenomes for allBrassicadid show differences in transposon/methylation densities near genes and did express, in the same samples of cells, biased gene expression diagnostic of subgenome dominance. We conclude that subgenome differences in methylated transposon near genes are not sufficient to initiate the biased gene expressions defining subgenome dominance. Our result was unexpected, and we suggest a ""nuclear chimera"" model to explain our data."

In this study, we examined the relationship between m6A and OSCC. Four pairs of OSCC and adjacent normal tissues were compared by Methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq). Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) analyses were used to further analyze the MeRIP-seq data. A total of 2,348 different m6A peaks were identified in the OSCC group, including 85 m6A upregulated peaks and 2,263 m6A downregulated peaks. Differentially methylated m6A binding sites were enriched in the coding sequence in proximity to the stop codon of both groups. KEGG analysis revealed genes with upregulated m6A-modified sites in the OSCC group, which were prominently associated with the forkhead box O (FOXO) signaling pathway. Genes containing downregulated m6A-modified sites were significantly correlated with the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, spliceosome, protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, and endocytosis. IPA analysis indicated that several genes with differential methylation peaks form networks with m6A regulators. Overall, this study established the mRNA-wide m6A map for human OSCC and indicated the potential links between OSCC and N6-methyladenosine modification."

The aim of the present study was to analyze γ-H2AX in the peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) of healthy adults before and after CT examination and to discover the differentially methylated positions (DMPs) along with an analysis of DNA methylation changes caused by CT examination.Peripheral blood samples of 4 ml were drawn from 20 healthy volunteers at three time points: before CT examination, after CT examination 1h, and after CT examination 24h. γ-H2AX immunofluorescence and Illumina Infinium Human Methylation EPIC BeadChip (850k BeadChip) were used respectively for the test of DSBs and the epigenome-wide DNA methylation analysis. Linear mixed-effect (LME) models were used to evaluate the impacts of doses represented by different parameters and foci on genome-wide DNA methylation.The number of γ-H2AX foci per cell at 1h showed linear dose-responses for the radiation doses represented by CT index volume (CTDIvol), dose length product (DLP), and blood absorbed dose, respectively. Residual γ-H2AX foci was observed after CT examination at 24h (p < .001). DMPs and γ-H2AX foci changes could be found within 1h. One CpG site related to PAX5 was significantly changed by using most of the parameters in LME models and did not recover till 24h.Residual γ-H2AX foci exist after CT examination at 24h. The DNA methylation changes induced by CT examination may not recover within 24h. The DNA methylation had been changed as early as at 1h. The PAX5-related CpG site may be a potential biomarker of low-dose radiation.The biological effects and the cancer risks of CT examination are still unclear. The present study is an effort to document the CT scan-induced events in 24h in vivo. The CT scanning area should be strictly limited, and non-essential repeated operations shouldn't be performed within 24h."
,37808212,Quantifying human genome parameters in aging.,Vavilovskii Zhurnal Genet Selektsii,"Healthy human longevity is a global goal of the world health system. Determining the causes and processes influencing human longevity is the primary fundamental goal facing the scientific community. Currently, the main efforts of the scientific community are aimed at identifying the qualitative characteristics of the genome that determine the trait. At the same time, when evaluating qualitative characteristics, there are many challenges that make it difficult to establish associations. Quantitative traits are burdened with such problems to a lesser extent, but they are largely overlooked in current genomic studies of aging and longevity. Although there is a wide repertoire of quantitative trait analyses based on genomic data, most opportunities are ignored by authors, which, along with the inaccessibility of published data, leads to the loss of this important information. This review focuses on describing quantitative traits important for understanding aging and necessary for analysis in further genomic studies, and recommends the inclusion of the described traits in the analysis. The review considers the relationship between quantitative characteristics of the mitochondrial genome and aging, longevity, and age-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as the frequency of extensive mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions, mtDNA half-life, the frequency of A>G replacements in the mtDNA heavy chain, the number of mtDNA copies; special attention is paid to the mtDNA methylation sign. A separate section of this review is devoted to the correlation of telomere length parameters with age, as well as the association of telomere length with the amount of mitochondrial DNA. In addition, we consider such a quantitative feature as the rate of accumulation of somatic mutations with aging in relation to the lifespan of living organisms. In general, it may be noted that there are quite serious reasons to suppose that various quantitative characteristics of the genome may be directly or indirectly associated with certain aspects of aging and longevity. At the same time, the available data are clearly insufficient for definitive conclusions and the determination of causal relationships.Copyright © AUTHORS."
,37807334,High expression of DNMT3A and DNMT3B regulatory factors of TGFB in non-neoplastic liver tissues of HCC.,Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand),"Increased expression of TGFB regulatory factors DNMT3A and DNMT3B in non-neoplastic liver tissues of HCC patients is the goal of this study. Furthermore, we demonstrate that TGF- is capable of elevating the percentage of CD133+ cells present in liver cancer cell lines in a manner that is both consistent and long-lasting over several cell divisions. This process is linked to stable alterations in DNA methylation that occur over the whole of the genome and continue even after cell division. In addition, the silencing of de novo DNA methyl-transferases with siRNA is able to inhibit the phenotypic changes that are induced by TGF-. According to the findings of our research, there is a self-sustaining interaction between the DNA methylation machinery and the TGF- signaling pathway, which may be significant in the development of cellular phenotypes. CD133 positive and negative fractions expand within liver cancer cell lines in proportions that remain stable throughout time. In contrast to their CD133- counterparts, MACS-sorted CD133+ Huh7cells demonstrated the ability to shape themselves into spheres when grown under non-attachment circumstances. This study also found that the TGF- is responsible for the de novo induction of CD133, which is linked to an increase in the expression of DNMT3 genes and there is a correlation between the TGF-induced transition in the cell subpopulation and a distinct DNA methylome. TGF- has the potential to generate genome-wide alterations in DNA methylation, which ultimately leads to a persistent shift in the fraction of liver cancer cell subpopulations."
,37805541,Effects of iron homeostasis on epigenetic age acceleration: a two-sample Mendelian randomization study.,Clin Epigenetics,"Epigenetic clocks constructed from DNA methylation patterns have emerged as excellent predictors of aging and aging-related health outcomes. Iron, a crucial element, is meticulously regulated within organisms, a phenomenon referred as iron homeostasis. Previous researches have demonstrated the sophisticated connection between aging and iron homeostasis. However, their causal relationship remains relatively unexplored.Through two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) utilizing the random effect inverse variance weighted (IVW) method, each standard deviation (SD) increase in serum iron was associated with increased GrimAge acceleration (GrimAA, BetaIVW = 0.27, P = 8.54E-03 in 2014 datasets; BetaIVW = 0.31, P = 1.25E-02 in 2021 datasets), HannumAge acceleration (HannumAA, BetaIVW = 0.32, P = 4.50E-03 in 2014 datasets; BetaIVW = 0.32, P = 8.03E-03 in 2021 datasets) and Intrinsic epigenetic age acceleration (IEAA, BetaIVW = 0.34, P = 5.33E-04 in 2014 datasets; BetaIVW = 0.49, P = 9.94E-04 in 2021 datasets). Similar results were also observed in transferrin saturation. While transferrin manifested a negative association with epigenetic age accelerations (EAAs) sensitivity analyses. Besides, lack of solid evidence to support a causal relationship from EAAs to iron-related biomarkers.The results of present investigation unveiled the causality of iron overload on acceleration of epigenetic clocks. Researches are warranted to illuminate the underlying mechanisms and formulate strategies for potential interventions.© 2023. BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature."
,37805474,Causal relationship between blood metabolites and risk of five infections: a Mendelian randomization study.,BMC Infect Dis,"Infectious diseases continue to pose a significant threat in the field of global public health, and our understanding of their metabolic pathogenesis remains limited. However, the advent of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) offers an unprecedented opportunity to unravel the relationship between metabolites and infections.Univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization (MR) was commandeered to elucidate the causal relationship between blood metabolism and five high-frequency infection phenotypes: sepsis, pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infections (URTI), urinary tract infections (UTI), and skin and subcutaneous tissue infection (SSTI). GWAS data for infections were derived from UK Biobank and the FinnGen consortium. The primary analysis was conducted using the inverse variance weighted method on the UK Biobank data, along with a series of sensitivity analyses. Subsequently, replication and meta-analysis were performed on the FinnGen consortium data.After primary analysis and a series of sensitivity analyses, 17 metabolites were identified from UK Biobank that have a causal relationship with five infections. Upon joint analysis with the FinGen cohort, 7 of these metabolites demonstrated consistent associations. Subsequently, we conducted a multivariable Mendelian randomization analysis to confirm the independent effects of these metabolites. Among known metabolites, genetically predicted 1-stearoylglycerol (1-SG) (odds ratio [OR] = 0.561, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.403-0.780, P < 0.001) and 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-2-furanpropanoate (CMPF) (OR = 0.780, 95%CI: 0.689-0.883, P < 0.001) was causatively associated with a lower risk of sepsis, and genetically predicted phenylacetate (PA) (OR = 1.426, 95%CI: 1.152-1.765, P = 0.001) and cysteine (OR = 1.522, 95%CI: 1.170-1.980, P = 0.002) were associated with an increased risk of UTI. Ursodeoxycholate (UDCA) (OR = 0.906, 95%CI: 0.829-0.990, P = 0.029) is a protective factor against pneumonia. Two unknown metabolites, X-12407 (OR = 1.294, 95%CI: 1.131-1.481, P < 0.001), and X-12847 (OR = 1.344, 95%CI: 1.152-1.568, P < 0.001), were also identified as independent risk factors for sepsis.In this MR study, we demonstrated a causal relationship between blood metabolites and the risk of developing sepsis, pneumonia, and UTI. However, there was no evidence of a causal connection between blood metabolites and the risk of URTI or SSTI, indicating a need for larger-scale studies to further investigate susceptibility to certain infection phenotypes.© 2023.

,37805114,Genome-wide DNA methylation mediates the resistance to vibriosis in Cynoglossus semilaevis.,Fish Shellfish Immunol,"Chinese tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis) is an economically important marine fish in China. However, vibriosis has caused huge mortality and economic losses in its culturing industry. To reveal the effect of DNA methylation on the resistance to vibriosis in tongue sole, we conducted RNA sequencing and whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), and compared the gene expressions and DNA methylation patterns between the resistant and susceptible families. We identified a total of 741 significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in kidney and 17460 differentially methylated genes (DMGs), which were both enriched in immune-related pathways, such as ""cAMP signaling pathway"" and ""NOD-like receptor signaling pathway"". Through the correlation analysis of DEGs and DMGs, we identified two important immune pathways, including ""complement and coagulation cascades"", and ""cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction"", which played important roles in regulating the inflammation level and immune homeostasis. For example, the expression of proinflammatory cytokine il17c was down-regulated under the regulation of DNA methylation; in addition, the expression of protease-activated receptor 3 (par3) was up-regulated, which could induce the up-expressionof il8. These results demonstrated that the regulation of DNA methylation on the genes involved in immune responses might contribute to the resistance to vibriosis in tongue sole, and provided a basis for the control of diseases in fish aquaculture.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

,37803336,Epigenomic signature of major congenital heart defects in newborns with Down syndrome.,Hum Genomics,"Congenital heart defects (CHDs) affect approximately half of individuals with Down syndrome (DS), but the molecular reasons for incomplete penetrance are unknown. Previous studies have largely focused on identifying genetic risk factors associated with CHDs in individuals with DS, but comprehensive studies of the contribution of epigenetic marks are lacking. We aimed to identify and characterize DNA methylation differences from newborn dried blood spots (NDBS) of DS individuals with major CHDs compared to DS individuals without CHDs.We used the Illumina EPIC array and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) to quantitate DNA methylation for 86 NDBS samples from the California Biobank Program: (1) 45 DS-CHD (27 female, 18 male) and (2) 41 DS non-CHD (27 female, 14 male). We analyzed global CpG methylation and identified differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in DS-CHD versus DS non-CHD comparisons (both sex-combined and sex-stratified) corrected for sex, age of blood collection, and cell-type proportions. CHD DMRs were analyzed for enrichment in CpG and genic contexts, chromatin states, and histone modifications by genomic coordinates and for gene ontology enrichment by gene mapping. DMRs were also tested in a replication dataset and compared to methylation levels in DS versus typical development (TD) WGBS NDBS samples.We found global CpG hypomethylation in DS-CHD males compared to DS non-CHD males, which was attributable to elevated levels of nucleated red blood cells and not seen in females. At a regional level, we identified 58, 341, and 3938 CHD-associated DMRs in the Sex Combined, Females Only, and Males Only groups, respectively, and used machine learning algorithms to select 19 Males Only loci that could distinguish CHD from non-CHD. DMRs in all comparisons were enriched for gene exons, CpG islands, and bivalent chromatin and mapped to genes enriched for terms related to cardiac and immune functions. Lastly, a greater percentage of CHD-associated DMRs than background regions were differentially methylated in DS versus TD samples.A sex-specific signature of DNA methylation was detected in NDBS of DS-CHD compared to DS non-CHD individuals. This supports the hypothesis that epigenetics can reflect the variability of phenotypes in DS, particularly CHDs.© 2023. BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature."
,37798757,NA,NA,"MTR gene encodes the cytoplasmic enzyme methionine synthase, which plays a pivotal role in the methionine cycle of one-carbon metabolism. This cycle holds a significant importance in generating S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), the respective universal methyl donor and end-product of epigenetic transmethylation reactions. cblG type of inherited disorders of vitamin B12 metabolism due to mutations in MTR gene exhibits a wide spectrum of symptoms, including a retinopathy unresponsive to conventional therapies.To unveil the underlying epigenetic pathological mechanisms, we conducted a comprehensive study of epigenomic-wide alterations of DNA methylation by NGS of bisulfited retinal DNA in an original murine model with conditional Mtr deletion in retinal tissue. Our focus was on postnatal day 21, a critical developmental juncture for ocular structure refinement and functional maturation.We observed delayed eye opening and impaired visual acuity and alterations in the one-carbon metabolomic profile, with a notable dramatic decline in SAM/SAH ratio predicted to impair DNA methylation. This metabolic disruption led to epigenome-wide changes in genes involved in eye development, synaptic plasticity, and retinoid metabolism, including promoter hypermethylation of Rarα, a regulator of Lrat expression. Consistently, we observed a decline in cone photoreceptor cells and reduced expression of Lrat, Rpe65, and Rdh5, three pivotal genes of eye retinoid metabolism.We introduced an original in vivo model for studying cblG retinopathy, which highlighted the pivotal role of altered DNA methylation in eye development, cone differentiation, and retinoid metabolism. This model can be used for preclinical studies of novel therapeutic targets.© 2023. BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature."
,37798118,Locus-resolution analysis of L1 regulation and retrotransposition potential in mouse embryonic development.,Genome Res,"Mice harbor ∼2800 intact copies of the retrotransposon Long Interspersed Element 1 (L1). The in vivo retrotransposition capacity of an L1 copy is defined by both its sequence integrity and epigenetic status, including DNA methylation of the monomeric units constituting young mouse L1 promoters. Locus-specific L1 methylation dynamics during development may therefore elucidate and explain spatiotemporal niches of endogenous retrotransposition but remain unresolved. Here, we interrogate the retrotransposition efficiency and epigenetic fate of source (donor) L1s, identified as mobile in vivo. We show that promoter monomer loss consistently attenuates the relative retrotransposition potential of their offspring (daughter) L1 insertions. We also observe that most donor/daughter L1 pairs are efficiently methylated upon differentiation in vivo and in vitro. We use Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-read sequencing to resolve L1 methylation genome-wide and at individual L1 loci, revealing a distinctive ""smile"" pattern in methylation levels across the L1 promoter region. Using Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) SMRT sequencing of L1 5' RACE products, we then examine DNA methylation dynamics at the mouse L1 promoter in parallel with transcription start site (TSS) distribution at locus-specific resolution. Together, our results offer a novel perspective on the interplay between epigenetic repression, L1 evolution, and genome stability.© 2023 Gerdes et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press."
,37797918,Loss of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a reduces docosahexaenoic acid-containing phospholipids and drives sexually dimorphic liver disease in mice.,Mol Metab,"Genome and epigenome wide association studies identified variants in carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (CPT1a) that associate with lipid traits. The goal of this study was to determine the role of liver-specific CPT1a on hepatic lipid metabolism.Male and female liver-specific knockout (LKO) and littermate controls were placed on a low-fat or high-fat diet (60% kcal fat) for 15 weeks. Mice were necropsied after a 16 h fast, and tissues were collected for lipidomics, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry imaging, kinome analysis, RNA-sequencing, and protein expression by immunoblotting. Female LKO mice had increased serum alanine aminotransferase levels which were associated with greater deposition of hepatic lipids, while male mice were not affected by CPT1a deletion relative to male control mice. Mice with CPT1a deletion had reductions in DHA-containing phospholipids at the expense of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)-containing phospholipids in whole liver and at the level of the lipid droplet (LD). Male and female LKO mice increased RNA levels of genes involved in LD lipolysis (Plin2, Cidec, G0S2) and in polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism (Elovl5, Fads1, Elovl2), while only female LKO mice increased genes involved in inflammation (Ly6d, Mmp12, Cxcl2). Kinase profiling showed decreased protein kinase A activity, which coincided with increased PLIN2, PLIN5, and G0S2 protein levels and decreased triglyceride hydrolysis in LKO mice.Liver-specific deletion of CPT1a promotes sexually dimorphic steatotic liver disease (SLD) in mice, and here we have identified new mechanisms by which females are protected from HFD-induced liver injury.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

,37797576,Comprehensive analysis of aflatoxin B(1) biosynthesis in Aspergillus flavus via transcriptome-wide m(6)A methylome response to cycloleucine.,J Hazard Mater,"Aspergillus flavus and its toxic aflatoxins secondary metabolites contaminate food and grains, posing a severe threat to human health and leading to liver cancer. Here, we demonstrated that cycloleucine blocked aflatoxin B1synthesis by inhibiting N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation modification of messenger RNA (mRNA). m6A Methylation Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (m6A MeRIP-Seq)-based comprehensive transcriptome-wide m6A profiling identified 102 differentially expressed genes that underwent m6A modification, of which 22 hypermethylated genes were downregulated and 49 hypomethylated genes were upregulated, suggesting a negative correlation between m6A methylation and gene expression. Notably, cycloleucine inhibited aflatoxin B1production via multiple targets. The m6A sites of several key genes involved in the aflatoxin B1biosynthesis pathway were significantly enriched in the coding sequence and around the stop codon, resulting in their downregulation. Furthermore, m6A methylation on genes related to the aflatoxin B1biosynthesis pathway led to reduced mRNA stability. Cycloleucine inhibition of aflatoxin B1production highlights its potential as an agent for removing mycotoxins in environmental pollution. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATION: Aflatoxins, highly carcinogenic secondary metabolites produced by Aspergillus flavus, frequently contaminate crops such as peanut, corn, wheat and sesame leading to irreversible loss in the quality and yield of agricultural products and posing serious threats to food safety. Aflatoxins has also been linked to developmental delays and liver cancer in humans. In our study, 'monitoring aflatoxin concentrations and its bioaccumulation in organisms' has been conducted. The results demonstrated that aflatoxin production in A. flavus was completely blocked after cycloleucine treatment. Additionally, we demonstrated that inhibition of aflatoxin was linked to N6-methyladenosine methylation of multiple genes in aflatoxin biosynthesis pathway.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

,37797206,Genomic asymmetric epigenetic modification of transposable elements is involved in gene expression regulation of allopolyploid Brassica napus.,Plant J,"Polyploids are common and have a wide geographical distribution and environmental adaptability. Allopolyploidy may lead to the activation of transposable elements (TE). However, the mechanism of epigenetic modification of TEs in the establishment and evolution of allopolyploids remains to be explored. We focused on the TEs of model allopolyploid Brassica napus (AnAnCnCn), exploring the TE characteristics of the genome, epigenetic modifications of TEs during allopolyploidization, and regulation of gene expression by TE methylation. In B. napus, approximately 50% of the genome was composed of TEs. TEs increased with proximity to genes, especially DNA transposons. TE methylation levels were negatively correlated with gene expression, and changes in TE methylation levels were able to regulate the expression of neighboring genes related to responses to light intensity and stress, which promoted powerful adaptation of allopolyploids to new environments. TEs can be synergistically regulated by RNA-directed DNA methylation pathways and histone modifications. The epigenetic modification levels of TEs tended to be similar to those of the diploid parents during the genome evolution of B. napus. The TEs of the Ansubgenome were more likely to be modified, and the imbalance in TE number and epigenetic modification level in the Anand Cnsubgenomes may lead to the establishment of subgenome dominance. Our study analyzed the characteristics of TE location, DNA methylation, siRNA, and histone modification in B. napus and highlighted the importance of TE epigenetic modifications during the allopolyploidy process, providing support for revealing the mechanism of allopolyploid formation and evolution.© 2023 Society for Experimental Biology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
,37797047,"Mouse methylation profiles for leukocyte cell types, and estimation of leukocyte fractions in inflamed gastrointestinal DNA samples.",PLoS One,"Precise analysis of tissue DNA and RNA samples is often hampered by contaminating non-target cells whose amounts are highly variable. DNA methylation profiles are specific to cell types, and can be utilized for assessment of the fraction of such contaminating non-target cells. Here, we aimed 1) to identify methylation profiles specific to multiple types of mouse leukocytes, and 2) to estimate the fraction of leukocytes infiltrating inflamed tissues using DNA samples. First, genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was conducted for three myeloid-lineage cells and four lymphoid-lineage cells isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting after magnetic-activated cell sorting from leukocytes in the spleen. Clustering analysis using CpG sites within enhancers separated the three myeloid-lineage cells and four lymphoid-lineage cells while that using promoter CpG islands (TSS200CGIs) did not. Among the 266,108 CpG sites analyzed, one CpG site was specifically hypermethylated (β value ≥ 0.7) in B cells, and four, seven, 183, and 34 CpG sites were specifically hypomethylated (β value < 0.2) in CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, and NK cells, respectively. Importantly, cell type-specific hypomethylated CpG sites were located at genes involved in cell type-specific biological functions. Then, marker CpG sites to estimate the leukocyte fraction in a tissue with leukocyte infiltration were selected, and an estimation algorithm was established. The fractions of infiltrating leukocytes were estimated to be 1.6-12.4% in the stomach (n = 10) with Helicobacter pylori-induced inflammation and 1.5-4.3% in the colon with dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis (n = 4), and the fractions were highly correlated with those estimated histologically using Cd45-stained tissue sections [R = 0.811 (p = 0.004)]. These results showed that mouse methylation profiles at CpG sites within enhancers reflected leukocyte cell lineages, and the use of marker CpG sites successfully estimated the leukocyte fraction in inflamed gastric and colon tissues.Copyright: © 2023 Nishiyama et al.

,37796009,Differential adenine methylation analysis reveals increased variability in 6mA in the absence of methyl-directed mismatch repair.,mBio,"Methylated DNA adenines (6mA) are a critical epigenetic modification in bacteria that affect cell processes like replication, stress response, and pathogenesis. While much work has been done characterizing the influence of 6mA on specific loci, very few studies have examined the evolutionary dynamics of 6mA over long time scales. We used third-generation sequencing technology to analyze 6mA methylation across theEscherichia coliK-12 substr. MG1655 genome. 6mA levels were consistently high across GATC sites; however, we identified regions where 6mA is decreased, particularly in intergenic regions, especially around the -35 promoter element, and within cryptic prophages and IS elements. We further examined 6mA in WT and methyl-directed mismatch repair-deficient (MMR-) populations after 2,400 generations of experimental evolution. We find that, after evolution, MMR- populations acquire significantly more epimutations resulting in a genome-wide decrease in 6mA methylation. Here, clones from evolved MMR- populations display non-deterministic sets of epimutations, consistent with reduced selection on these modifications. Thus, we show that characterization of 6mA in bacterial populations is complementary to genetic sequencing and informative for molecular evolution. IMPORTANCE Methylation greatly influences the bacterial genome by guiding DNA repair and regulating pathogenic and stress-response phenotypes. But, the rate of epigenetic changes and their consequences on molecular phenotypes are underexplored. Through a detailed characterization of genome-wide adenine methylation in a commonly used laboratory strain ofEscherichia coli, we reveal that mismatch repair deficient populations experience an increase in epimutations resulting in a genome-wide reduction of 6mA methylation in a manner consistent with genetic drift. Our findings highlight how methylation patterns evolve and the constraints on epigenetic evolution due to post-replicative DNA repair, contributing to a deeper understanding of bacterial genome evolution and how epimutations may introduce semi-permanent variation that can influence adaptation."
x,37794510,NA,NA,"Early detection has proven to be the most effective strategy to reduce the incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer (CRC). Nevertheless, most current screening programs suffer from low participation rates. A blood test may improve both the adherence to screening and the selection to colonoscopy. In this study, we conducted a serum-based discovery and validation of cfDNA methylation biomarkers for CRC screening in a multicenter cohort of 433 serum samples including healthy controls, benign pathologies, advanced adenomas (AA), and CRC.First, we performed an epigenome-wide methylation analysis with the MethylationEPIC array using a sample pooling approach, followed by a robust prioritization of candidate biomarkers for the detection of advanced neoplasia (AN: AA and CRC). Then, candidate biomarkers were validated by pyrosequencing in independent individual cfDNA samples. We report GALNT9, UPF3A, WARS, and LDB2 as new noninvasive biomarkers for the early detection of AN. The combination of GALNT9/UPF3A by logistic regression discriminated AN with 78.8% sensitivity and 100% specificity, outperforming the commonly used fecal immunochemical test and the methylated SEPT9 blood test.Overall, this study highlights the utility of cfDNA methylation for CRC screening. Our results suggest that the combination methylated GALNT9/UPF3A has the potential to serve as a highly specific and sensitive blood-based test for screening and early detection of CRC.© 2023.

x,37794499,NA,NA,"Genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAme) profiling of the placenta with Illumina Infinium Methylation bead arrays is often used to explore the connections between in utero exposures, placental pathology, and fetal development. However, many technical and biological factors can lead to signals of DNAme variation between samples and between cohorts, and understanding and accounting for these factors is essential to ensure meaningful and replicable data analysis. Recently, ""epiphenotyping"" approaches have been developed whereby DNAme data can be used to impute information about phenotypic variables such as gestational age, sex, cell composition, and ancestry. These epiphenotypes offer avenues to compare phenotypic data across cohorts, and to understand how phenotypic variables relate to DNAme variability. However, the relationships between placental epiphenotyping variables and other technical and biological variables, and their application to downstream epigenome analyses, have not been well studied.Using DNAme data from 204 placentas across three cohorts, we applied the PlaNET R package to estimate epiphenotypes gestational age, ancestry, and cell composition in these samples. PlaNET ancestry estimates were highly correlated with independent polymorphic ancestry-informative markers, and epigenetic gestational age, on average, was estimated within 4 days of reported gestational age, underscoring the accuracy of these tools. Cell composition estimates varied both within and between cohorts, as well as over very long placental processing times. Interestingly, the ratio of cytotrophoblast to syncytiotrophoblast proportion decreased with increasing gestational age, and differed slightly by both maternal ethnicity (lower in white vs. non-white) and genetic ancestry (lower in higher probability European ancestry). The cohort of origin and cytotrophoblast proportion were the largest drivers of DNAme variation in this dataset, based on their associations with the first principal component.This work confirms that cohort, array (technical) batch, cell type proportion, self-reported ethnicity, genetic ancestry, and biological sex are important variables to consider in any analyses of Illumina DNAme data. We further demonstrate the specific utility of epiphenotyping tools developed for use with placental DNAme data, and show that these variables (i) provide an independent check of clinically obtained data and (ii) provide a robust approach to compare variables across different datasets. Finally, we present a general framework for the processing and analysis of placental DNAme data, integrating the epiphenotype variables discussed here.© 2023.

,37794492,NA,NA,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have identified several risk loci, but many remain unknown. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers may aid in gene discovery and we previously demonstrated that six CSF biomarkers (β-amyloid, total/phosphorylated tau, NfL, YKL-40, and neurogranin) cluster into five principal components (PC), each representing statistically independent biological processes. Here, we aimed to (1) identify common genetic variants associated with these CSF profiles, (2) assess the role of associated variants in AD pathophysiology, and (3) explore potential sex differences.We performed GWAS for each of the five biomarker PCs in two multi-center studies (EMIF-AD and ADNI). In total, 973 participants (n = 205 controls, n = 546 mild cognitive impairment, n = 222 AD) were analyzed for 7,433,949 common SNPs and 19,511 protein-coding genes. Structural equation models tested whether biomarker PCs mediate genetic risk effects on AD, and stratified and interaction models probed for sex-specific effects.Five loci showed genome-wide significant association with CSF profiles, two were novel (rs145791381 [inflammation] and GRIN2D [synaptic functioning]) and three were previously described (APOE, TMEM106B, and CHI3L1). Follow-up analyses of the two novel signals in independent datasets only supported the GRIN2D locus, which contains several functionally interesting candidate genes. Mediation tests indicated that variants in APOE are associated with AD status via processes related to amyloid and tau pathology, while markers in TMEM106B and CHI3L1 are associated with AD only via neuronal injury/inflammation. Additionally, seven loci showed sex-specific associations with AD biomarkers.These results suggest that pathway and sex-specific analyses can improve our understanding of AD genetics and may contribute to precision medicine.© 2023.

For each diet score, we performed linear EWAS adjusted for age, sex, blood cells, smoking and technical variables, and BMI in a second set of models. We also conducted Mendelian randomization analyses to assess the potential causal relationship between diet-related CpGs and cardiometabolic traits.We found 18 differentially methylated CpGs associated with dietary scores (p-value < 1.08 × 10-7; Bonferroni correction), of which 12 were previously associated with cardiometabolic traits. Enrichment analysis revealed overrepresentation of diet-associated genes in pathways involved in inflammation and cardiovascular disease. Mendelian randomization analyses suggested that genetically determined methylation levels corresponding to lower diet quality at cg02079413 (SNORA54), cg02107842 (MAST4), and cg23761815 (SLC29A3) were causally associated with higher BMI, and at cg05399785 (WDR8) with greater SBP; and methylation levels associated with higher diet quality at cg00711496 (PRMT1) with lower BMI, T2D risk and CHD risk, and at cg0557921 (AHRR) with lower CHD risk.Diet quality in adults was related to differential methylation in blood at 18 CpGs, some of which related to cardiometabolic health.Availability: The R code for the analysis is available in the following Github repository: https://github.com/jorgedb98/B64_DIAMETR.git.© The Author(s) 2023.

The CNTR conducted epidemiological investigations and blood withdrawal twice in 2013 and 2018. These included twins were used to perform epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) and to validate the previously reported PD-associated CpGs selected from previous EWASs in PubMed, Embase, and the EWAS catalog. Next, a cross-lagged study was performed to examine the temporality between changes in DNAm and PD in 308 twins who completed both 2013 and 2018 surveys.The EWAS analysis of our study identified 25 CpGs. In the validation analysis, 741 CpGs from 29 previous EWASs on PD were selected for validation, and 101 CpGs were validated to be significant at a false discovery rate <0.05. The cross-lagged analysis found a unidirectional path from PD to DNAm at 14 CpGs, while no sites showed significance from DNAm to PD.This study identified and validated PD-related CpGs in a Chinese twin population, and suggested that PD may be the cause of changes in DNAm over time. The findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying PD pathophysiology.© 2023 The Authors.

,37791891,Systematic mapping of chemoreceptor specificities for Pseudomonas aeruginosa.,mBio,"The chemotaxis network, one of the most prominent prokaryotic sensory systems, is present in most motile bacteria and archaea. Although the conserved signaling core of this network is well characterized, ligand specificities of a large majority of diverse chemoreceptors encoded in bacterial genomes remain unknown. Here, we performed a systematic identification and characterization of new chemoeffectors for the opportunistic pathogenPseudomonas aeruginosa, which has 26 chemoreceptors possessing most of the common types of ligand binding domains. By performing capillary chemotaxis assays for a library of growth-promoting compounds, we first identified a number of novel chemoattractants of varying strength. We subsequently mapped specificities of these ligands by performing Förster resonance energy transfer and microfluidic measurements for 16 hybrid chemoreceptors that combine the periplasmic ligand binding domains ofP. aeruginosareceptors and the cytoplasmic signaling domain of theEscherichia coliTar receptor. Direct binding of putative ligands to chemoreceptors was further confirmed using thermal shift assay and microcalorimetry. Altogether, the combination of methods enabled us to assign several new attractants, including methyl 4-aminobutyrate, 5-aminovalerate, L-ornithine, 2-phenylethylamine, and tyramine, to previously characterized chemoreceptors and to annotate a novel purine-specific receptor PctP. Responses of hybrid receptors to changes in pH further revealed a complex bidirectional pH sensing mechanism inP. aeruginosa, which involves at least four chemoreceptors PctA, PctC, TlpQ, and PctP. Our screening strategy could be applied for the systematic characterization of unknown sensory domains in a wide range of bacterial species. IMPORTANCE Chemotaxis of motile bacteria has multiple physiological functions. It enables bacteria to locate optimal ecological niches, mediates collective behaviors, and can play an important role in infection. These multiple functions largely depend on ligand specificities of chemoreceptors, and the number and identities of chemoreceptors show high diversity between organisms. Similar diversity is observed for the spectra of chemoeffectors, which include not only chemicals of high metabolic value but also bacterial, plant, and animal signaling molecules. However, the systematic identification of chemoeffectors and their mapping to specific chemoreceptors remains a challenge. Here, we combined severalin vivoandin vitroapproaches to establish a systematic screening strategy for the identification of receptor ligands and we applied it to identify a number of new physiologically relevant chemoeffectors for the important opportunistic human pathogenP. aeruginosa. This strategy can be equally applicable to map specificities of sensory domains from a wide variety of receptor types and bacteria."
x,37790540,Smoking-informed methylation and expression QTLs in human brain and colocalization with smoking-associated genetic loci.,medRxiv,"Smoking is a leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality. Smoking is heritable, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of smoking behaviors have identified hundreds of significant loci. Most GWAS-identified variants are noncoding with unknown neurobiological effects. We used genome-wide genotype, DNA methylation, and RNA sequencing data in postmortem human nucleus accumbens (NAc) to identify cis-methylation/expression quantitative trait loci (meQTLs/eQTLs), investigate variant-by-cigarette smoking interactions across the genome, and overlay QTL evidence at smoking GWAS-identified loci to evaluate their regulatory potential. Active smokers (N=52) and nonsmokers (N=171) were defined based on cotinine biomarker levels and next-of-kin reporting. We simultaneously tested variant and variant-by-smoking interaction effects on methylation and expression, separately, adjusting for biological and technical covariates and using a two-stage multiple testing approach with eigenMT and Bonferroni corrections. We found >2 million significant meQTL variants (padj<0.05) corresponding to 41,695 unique CpGs. Results were largely driven by main effects; five meQTLs, mapping toNUDT12,FAM53B,RNF39, andADRA1B, showed a significant interaction with smoking. We found 57,683 significant eQTLs for 958 unique eGenes (padj<0.05) and no smoking interactions. Colocalization analyses identified loci with smoking-associated GWAS variants that overlapped meQTLs/eQTLs, suggesting that these heritable factors may influence smoking behaviors through functional effects on methylation/expression. One locus containingMUSTIN1andITIH4colocalized across all data types (GWAS + meQTL + eQTL). In this first genome-wide meQTL map in the human NAc, the enriched overlap with smoking GWAS-identified genetic loci provides evidence that gene regulation in the brain helps explain the neurobiology of smoking behaviors."

We aimed to investigate genome-wide DNA methylation networks in post-mortem Parkinson's disease brain samples and test for region-specific association with common neuropsychiatric and cognitive symptoms. Of traits tested, we identify a co-methylation module in the substantia nigra with significant correlation to depressive symptoms and with ontological enrichment for terms relevant to neuronal and synaptic processes. Notably, expression of the genes annotated to the methylation loci present within this module are found to be significantly enriched in neuronal subtypes within the substantia nigra. These findings highlight the potential involvement of neuronal-specific changes within the substantia nigra with regard to depressive symptoms in Parkinson's disease."
,37788997,PLK1 maintains DNA methylation and cell viability by regulating phosphorylation-dependent UHRF1 protein stability.,Cell Death Discov,"PLK1 is a key serine/threonine kinase as well as a master mitotic regulator, but it has never been reported that PLK1 regulates DNA methylation. In the present study, we for the first time found that PLK1 inhibition disrupted global DNA methylation and elevated the expression level of tumor suppressor genes. Mechanistically, we found that PLK1 interacts UHRF1 protein to induce its phosphorylation at serine 265. Phosphorylation is required for the maintenance of UHRF1 protein stability by recruiting a deubiquitinase USP7. Conversely, PLK1 inhibition decreases UHRF1 protein interaction with USP7 and activates the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, thereby accelerating UHRF1 protein degradation. UHRF1 degradation decreases the recruitment of DNMT1 to chromatin, and decreases the level of genome-wide DNA methylation, thereby elevating the expression of tumor suppressor genes and decreasing cell viability. We here presented the first report on the novel role of PLK1 in DNA methylation maintenance through UHRF1-DNMT1 pathway, and revealed a novel anticancer mechanism of PLK1 inhibitors.© 2023.

,37787018,"Precision oncology: Artificial intelligence, circulating cell-free DNA, and the minimally invasive detection of pancreatic cancer-A pilot study.",Cancer Med,"Pancreatic cancer (PC) is among the most lethal cancers. The lack of effective tools for early detection results in late tumor detection and, consequently, high mortality rate. Precision oncology aims to develop targeted individual treatments based on advanced computational approaches of omics data. Biomarkers, such as global alteration of cytosine (CpG) methylation, can be pivotal for these objectives. In this study, we performed DNA methylation profiling of pancreatic cancer patients using circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and artificial intelligence (AI) including Deep Learning (DL) for minimally invasive detection to elucidate the epigenetic pathogenesis of PC.The Illumina Infinium HD Assay was used for genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of cfDNA in treatment-naïve patients. Six AI algorithms were used to determine PC detection accuracy based on cytosine (CpG) methylation markers. Additional strategies for minimizing overfitting were employed. The molecular pathogenesis was interrogated using enrichment analysis.In total, we identified 4556 significantly differentially methylated CpGs (q-value < 0.05; Bonferroni correction) in PC versus controls. Highly accurate PC detection was achieved with all 6 AI platforms (Area under the receiver operator characteristics curve [0.90-1.00]). For example, DL achieved AUC (95% CI): 1.00 (0.95-1.00), with a sensitivity and specificity of 100%. A separate modeling approach based on logistic regression-based yielded an AUC (95% CI) 1.0 (1.0-1.0) with a sensitivity and specificity of 100% for PC detection. The top four biological pathways that were epigenetically altered in PC and are known to be linked with cancer are discussed.Using a minimally invasive approach, AI, and epigenetic analysis of circulating cfDNA, high predictive accuracy for PC was achieved. From a clinical perspective, our findings suggest that that early detection leading to improved overall survival may be achievable in the future.© 2023 The Authors.

x,37784136,NA,NA,"Albuterol is the first-line asthma medication used in diverse populations. Although DNA methylation (DNAm) is an epigenetic mechanism involved in asthma and bronchodilator drug response (BDR), no study has assessed whether albuterol could induce changes in the airway epithelial methylome. We aimed to characterize albuterol-induced DNAm changes in airway epithelial cells, and assess potential functional consequences and the influence of genetic variation and asthma-related clinical variables.We followed a discovery and validation study design to characterize albuterol-induced DNAm changes in paired airway epithelial cultures stimulated in vitro with albuterol. In the discovery phase, an epigenome-wide association study using paired nasal epithelial cultures from Puerto Rican children (n = 97) identified 22 CpGs genome-wide associated with repeated-use albuterol treatment (p < 9 × 10-8). Albuterol predominantly induced a hypomethylation effect on CpGs captured by the EPIC array across the genome (probability of hypomethylation: 76%, p value = 3.3 × 10-5). DNAm changes on the CpGs cg23032799 (CREB3L1), cg00483640 (MYLK4-LINC01600), and cg05673431 (KSR1) were validated in nasal epithelia from 10 independent donors (false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05). The effect on the CpG cg23032799 (CREB3L1) was cross-tissue validated in bronchial epithelial cells at nominal level (p = 0.030). DNAm changes in these three CpGs were shown to be influenced by three independent genetic variants (FDR < 0.05). In silico analyses showed these polymorphisms regulated gene expression of nearby genes in lungs and/or fibroblasts including KSR1 and LINC01600 (6.30 × 10-14 ≤ p ≤ 6.60 × 10-5). Additionally, hypomethylation at the CpGs cg10290200 (FLNC) and cg05673431 (KSR1) was associated with increased gene expression of the genes where they are located (FDR < 0.05). Furthermore, while the epigenetic effect of albuterol was independent of the asthma status, severity, and use of medication, BDR was nominally associated with the effect on the CpG cg23032799 (CREB3L1) (p = 0.004). Gene-set enrichment analyses revealed that epigenomic modifications of albuterol could participate in asthma-relevant processes (e.g., IL-2, TNF-α, and NF-κB signaling pathways). Finally, nine differentially methylated regions were associated with albuterol treatment, including CREB3L1, MYLK4, and KSR1 (adjusted p value < 0.05).This study revealed evidence of epigenetic modifications induced by albuterol in the mucociliary airway epithelium. The epigenomic response induced by albuterol might have potential clinical implications by affecting biological pathways relevant to asthma.© 2023. BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature."
x,37782664,Genome-wide single-molecule analysis of long-read DNA methylation reveals heterogeneous patterns at heterochromatin that reflect nucleosome organisation.,PLoS Genet,"High-throughput sequencing technology is central to our current understanding of the human methylome. The vast majority of studies use chemical conversion to analyse bulk-level patterns of DNA methylation across the genome from a population of cells. While this technology has been used to probe single-molecule methylation patterns, such analyses are limited to short reads of a few hundred basepairs. DNA methylation can also be directly detected using Nanopore sequencing which can generate reads measuring megabases in length. However, thus far these analyses have largely focused on bulk-level assessment of DNA methylation. Here, we analyse DNA methylation in single Nanopore reads from human lymphoblastoid cells, to show that bulk-level metrics underestimate large-scale heterogeneity in the methylome. We use the correlation in methylation state between neighbouring sites to quantify single-molecule heterogeneity and find that heterogeneity varies significantly across the human genome, with some regions having heterogeneous methylation patterns at the single-molecule level and others possessing more homogeneous methylation patterns. By comparing the genomic distribution of the correlation to epigenomic annotations, we find that the greatest heterogeneity in single-molecule patterns is observed within heterochromatic partially methylated domains (PMDs). In contrast, reads originating from euchromatic regions and gene bodies have more ordered DNA methylation patterns. By analysing the patterns of single molecules in more detail, we show the existence of a nucleosome-scale periodicity in DNA methylation that accounts for some of the heterogeneity we uncover in long single-molecule DNA methylation patterns. We find that this periodic structure is partially masked in bulk data and correlates with DNA accessibility as measured by nanoNOMe-seq, suggesting that it could be generated by nucleosomes. Our findings demonstrate the power of single-molecule analysis of long-read data to understand the structure of the human methylome.Copyright: © 2023 Kerr et al.

,37782440,Associations of measured and genetically predicted leukocyte telomere length with vascular phenotypes: a population-based study.,Geroscience,"Shorter leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is associated with cardiovascular dysfunction. Whether this association differs between measured and genetically predicted LTL is still unclear. Moreover, the molecular processes underlying the association remain largely unknown. We used baseline data of the Rhineland Study, an ongoing population-based cohort study in Bonn, Germany [56.2% women, age: 55.5 ± 14.0 years (range 30 - 95 years)]. We calculated genetically predicted LTL in 4180 participants and measured LTL in a subset of 1828 participants with qPCR. Using multivariable regression, we examined the association of measured and genetically predicted LTL, and the difference between measured and genetically predicted LTL (ΔLTL), with four vascular functional domains and the overall vascular health. Moreover, we performed epigenome-wide association studies of three LTL measures. Longer measured LTL was associated with better microvascular and cardiac function. Longer predicted LTL was associated with better cardiac function. Larger ΔLTL was associated with better microvascular and cardiac function and overall vascular health, independent of genetically predicted LTL. Several CpGs were associated (p < 1e-05) with measured LTL (n = 5), genetically predicted LTL (n = 8), and ΔLTL (n = 27). Genes whose methylation status was associated with ΔLTL were enriched in vascular endothelial signaling pathways and have been linked to environmental exposures, cardiovascular diseases, and mortality. Our findings suggest that non-genetic causes of LTL contribute to microvascular and cardiac function and overall vascular health, through an effect on the vascular endothelial signaling pathway. Interventions that counteract LTL may thus improve vascular function.© 2023. The Author(s)."
,37781866,Knocking down a DNA demethylase gene affects potato plant defense against a specialist insect herbivore.,J Exp Bot,"DNA demethylase (DML) is involved in plant development and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses, however, its role in plant-herbivore interaction remains elusive. Here, we found that the potato tuber moth, Phthorimaea operculella's herbivory rapidly induced the genome-wide DNA methylation and accumulation of DML genes' transcripts in potato plants. Herbivory-induction of DMLs' transcripts was suppressed in jasmonate-deficient plants, whereas exogenous application of methyl jasmonate (MeJA) improved DMLs' transcripts, indicating that the induction of DMLs' transcripts by herbivory is associated with jasmonate signaling. Moreover, P. operculella larvae grew heavier on a DML gene (StDML2)-knocked-down plants than on wildtype plants, and the decreased biosynthesis of jasmonates in the former may be responsible for this difference, since the larvae feeding on these two genotypes supplemented with MeJA showed similar growth. In addition, P. operculella adult moth preferred to oviposit on StDML2-knocked-down plants than on wildtype plants, which was associated with the reduced emission of ß-caryophyllene in the former. And supplementing ß-caryophyllene to these two genotypes further disrupted moths' oviposit choice preference for them. Interestingly, in StDML2-knocked-down plants, hypermethylation was found at the promoter regions for the key genes StAOS and StAOC in jasmonate biosynthetic pathway, as well as for the key gene StTPS12 in ß-caryophyllene production. Our findings suggest that knocking down StDML2 can affect plant's herbivore defense via affecting jasmonate signaling and defense compound production in potato plants.© The Author(s) 2023.

,37781626,Predicting gene expression changes upon epigenomic drug treatment.,bioRxiv,"Tumors are characterized by global changes in epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation and histone modifications that are functionally linked to tumor progression. Accordingly, several drugs targeting the epigenome have been proposed for cancer therapy, notably, histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) such asVorinostatisand DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) such asZebularine. However, a fundamental challenge with such approaches is the lack of genomic specificity, i.e., the transcriptional changes at different genomic loci can be highly variable thus making it difficult to predict the consequences on the global transcriptome and drug response. For instance, treatment with DNMTi may upregulate the expression of not only a tumor suppressor but also an oncogene leading to unintended adverse effect.Given the pre-treatment transcriptome and epigenomic profile of a sample, we assessed the extent of predictability of locus-specific changes in gene expression upon treatment with HDACi using machine learning.We found that in two cell lines (HCT116 treated with Largazole at 8 doses and RH4 treated with Entinostat at 1μM) where the appropriate data (pre-treatment transcriptome and epigenome as well as post-treatment transcriptome) is available, our model distinguished the post-treatment up versus downregulated genes with high accuracy (up to ROC of 0.89). Furthermore, a model trained on one cell line is applicable to another cell line suggesting generalizability of the model.Here we present a first assessment of the predictability of genome-wide transcriptomic changes upon treatment with HDACi. Lack of appropriate omics data from clinical trials of epigenetic drugs currently hampers the assessment of applicability of our approach in clinical setting."

This study aimed to identify different methylation sites as new methylation markers in CRC and colorectal adenoma through tissue detection.DNA extraction and bisulfite modification as well as Infinium 450K methylation microarray detection were performed in 46 samples of sporadic colorectal cancer tissue, nine samples of colorectal adenoma, and 20 normal samples, and bioinformatic analysis was conducted involving genes enrichments of GO and KEGG. Pyrosequencing methylation detection was further performed in 68 sporadic colorectal cancer tissues, 31 samples of colorectal adenoma, and 49 normal colorectal mucosae adjacent to carcinoma to investigate the differentially methylated genes obtained from methylation microarray.There were 65,535 differential methylation marker probes, among which 25,464 were hypermethylated markers and 40,071 were hypomethylated markers in the adenoma compared with the normal group, and 395,571 were differentially methylated markers in patients with sporadic colorectal cancer compared with the normal group, including 21,710 hypermethylated markers and 17,861 hypomethylated markers. Five hypermethylated genes including ZNF471, SND1, SPOCK1, FBLIM1, and OTX1 were detected and confirmed in 68 cases of colorectal cancer, 31 cases of adenoma, and 49 cases of normal control group.Hypermethylated genes of ZNF471, SND1, SPOCK1, FBLIM1, and OTX1 were obtained from methylation chip detection and further confirm analysis in colorectal cancer and adenoma compared with normal tissue, which may be promising diagnostic markers of colorectal cancer and colorectal adenoma.© 2023.

,37773256,NA,NA,"Untreated fresh cardiac tissue is the optimal tissue material for investigating DNA methylation patterns of cardiac biology and diseases. However, fresh tissue is difficult to obtain. Therefore, tissue stored as frozen or formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) is widely used for DNA methylation studies. It is unknown whether storage conditions alter the DNA methylation in cardiac tissue. In this study, we compared the DNA methylation patterns of fresh, frozen, and FFPE cardiac tissue to investigate if the storage method affected the DNA methylation results. We used the Infinium MethylationEPIC assay to obtain genome-wide methylation levels in fresh, frozen, and FFPE tissues from nine individuals. We found that the DNA methylation levels of 21.4% of the examined CpG sites were overestimated in the FFPE samples compared to that of fresh and frozen tissue, whereas 5.7% were underestimated. Duplicate analyses of the DNA methylation patterns showed high reproducibility (precision) for frozen and FFPE tissues. In conclusion, we found that frozen and FFPE tissues gave reproducible DNA methylation results and that frozen and fresh tissues gave similar results.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."
x,37770973,Effect of women's fertility and sexual development on epigenetic clock: Mendelian randomization study.,Clin Epigenetics,"In observational studies, women's fertility and sexual development traits may have implications for DNA methylation patterns, and pregnancy-related risk factors can also affect maternal DNA methylation patterns. The aim of our study is to disentangle any potential causal associations between women's fertility and sexual development traits and epigenetic clocks, as well as to search for probable mediators by using the Mendelian randomization (MR) method.Instrumental variables for exposures, mediators, and outcomes were adopted from genome-wide association studies data of European ancestry individuals. The potential causal relationship between women's fertility and sexual development traits and four epigenetic clocks were evaluated by inverse variance weighted method and verified by other two methods. Furthermore, we employed multivariable MR (MVMR) adjusting for hypertension, hyperglycemia, BMI changes, and insomnia. Then, combining the MVMR results and previous research, we performed two-step MR to explore the mediating effects of BMI, AFS, and AFB. Multiple sensitivity analyses were further performed to verify the robustness of our findings.Leveraging two-sample MR analysis, we observed statistically significant associations between earlier age at first birth (AFB) with a higher HannumAge, PhenoAge and GrimAge acceleration(β = - 0.429, 95% CI [- 0.781 to - 0.077], p = 0.017 for HannumAge; β = - 0.571, 95% CI [- 1.006 to - 0.136], p = 0.010 for PhenoAge, and β = - 1.136, 95% CI [- 1.508 to - 0.765], p = 2.03E-09 for GrimAge respectively) and age at first sexual intercourse (AFS) with a higher HannumAge and GrimAge acceleration(β = - 0.175, 95% CI [- 0.336 to - 0.014], p = 0.033 for HannumAge; β = - 0.210, 95% CI [- 0.350 to - 0.070], p = 0.003 for GrimAge, respectively). Further analyses indicated that BMI, AFB and AFS played mediator roles in the path from women's fertility and sexual development traits to epigenetic aging.Our study suggested that AFS and AFB are associated with epigenetic aging. These findings may prove valuable in informing the development of prevention strategies and interventions targeted towards women's fertility and sexual development experiences and their relationship with epigenetic aging-related diseases.© 2023.

The relationship between radon exposure in underground miners and lung cancer has already been established, but the mechanisms and biological processes underlying it are poorly understood. In order to identify the genome-wide DNA methylation profile associated with long-term radon exposure, we performed the Infinium Human Methylation 850 K BeadChip measurement in whole blood samples obtained from 15 underground non-uranium miners and 10 matched aboveground control workers. Radon concentrations in the air of workplaces and living environments were measured by CR-39 radon detectors, and annual effective doses were calculated using the detection data. Under the high radon concentration with an average value of 12,700 Bq·m-3, a total of 165 significant differentially methylated positions (127 hypermethylated sites and 38 hypomethylated sites) annotated to 71 genes were identified in underground miners (|Δβ| ≥ 0.10, p < 0.05), and the average DNA methylation level of 165 DMPs was significantly higher than that of the control workers. Most DMPs were found on chromosome 1, and approximately one-quarter of them were located in genomic promoter regions. Through bioinformatics analysis and pyrosequencing validation, five candidate genes differentially methylated by radon, including TIMP2, EMP2, CPT1B, AMD1 and SLC43A2 were identified. GO and KEGG analysis implicated that long term radon exposure could induce the lung cancer related biological processes such as cell adhesion and cellular polarity maintenance. Our study provides evidence for the alterations of genome-wide DNA methylation profiles induced by long-term high level radon exposure, and new insights into searching for carcinogenic biomarkers of high radon exposure in future studies.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

,37762546,Functional Insight into and Refinement of the Genomic Boundaries of the JARID2-Neurodevelopmental Disorder Episignature.,Int J Mol Sci,"JARID2(Jumonji, AT-rich interactive domain 2) haploinsufficiency is associated with a clinically distinct neurodevelopmental syndrome. It is characterized by intellectual disability, developmental delay, autistic features, behavior abnormalities, cognitive impairment, hypotonia, and dysmorphic features.JARID2acts as a transcriptional repressor protein that is involved in the regulation of histone methyltransferase complexes.JARID2plays a role in the epigenetic machinery, and the associated syndrome has an identified DNA methylation episignature derived from sequence variants and intragenic deletions involvingJARID2. For this study, our aim was to determine whether patients with larger deletions spanning beyondJARID2present a similar DNA methylation episignature and to define the critical region involved in aberrant DNA methylation in 6p22-p24 microdeletions. We examined the DNA methylation profiles of peripheral blood from 56 control subjects, 13 patients with (likely) pathogenicJARID2variants or patients carrying copy number variants, and three patients withJARID2VUS variants. The analysis showed a distinct and strong differentiation between patients with (likely) pathogenic variants, both sequence and copy number, and controls. Using the identified episignature, we developed a binary model to classify patients with theJARID2-neurodevelopmental syndrome. DNA methylation analysis indicated thatJARID2is the driver gene for aberrant DNA methylation observed in 6p22-p24 microdeletions. In addition, we performed analysis of functional correlation of theJARID2genome-wide methylation profile with the DNA methylation profiles of 56 additional neurodevelopmental disorders. To conclude, we refined the critical region for the presence of theJARID2episignature in 6p22-p24 microdeletions and provide insight into the functional changes in the epigenome observed when regulation byJARID2is lost."
x,37762215,NA,NA,"Mastocytosis is a clinically heterogenous, usually acquired disease of the mast cells with a survival time that depends on the time of onset. It ranges from skin-limited to systemic disease, including indolent and more aggressive variants. The presence of the oncogenic KIT p. D816V gene somatic mutation is a crucial element in the pathogenesis. However, further epigenetic regulation may also affect the expression of genes that are relevant to the pathology. Epigenetic alterations are responsible for regulating the expression of genes that do not modify the DNA sequence. In general, it is accepted that DNA methylation inhibits the binding of transcription factors, thereby down-regulating gene expression. However, so far, little is known about the epigenetic factors leading to the clinical onset of mastocytosis. Therefore, it is essential to identify possible epigenetic predictors, indicators of disease progression, and their link to the clinical picture to establish appropriate management and a therapeutic strategy. The aim of this study was to analyze genome-wide methylation profiles to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in patients with mastocytosis compared to healthy individuals, as well as the genes located in those regulatory regions. Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling was performed in peripheral blood collected from 80 adult patients with indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM), the most prevalent subvariant of mastocytosis, and 40 healthy adult volunteers. A total of 117 DNA samples met the criteria for the bisulfide conversion step and microarray analysis. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was performed using a MethylationEPIC BeadChip kit. Further analysis was focused on the genomic regions rather than individual CpG sites. Co-methylated regions (CMRs) were assigned via the CoMeBack method. To identify DMRs between the groups, a linear regression model with age as the covariate on CMRs was performed using Limma. Using the available data for cases only, an association analysis was performed between methylation status and tryptase levels, as well as the context of allergy, and anaphylaxis. KEGG pathway mapping was used to identify genes differentially expressed in anaphylaxis. Based on the DNA methylation results, the expression of 18 genes was then analyzed via real-time PCR in 20 patients with mastocytosis and 20 healthy adults. A comparison of the genome-wide DNA methylation profile between the mastocytosis patients and healthy controls revealed significant differences in the methylation levels of 85 selected CMRs. Among those, the most intriguing CMRs are 31 genes located within the regulatory regions. In addition, among the 10 CMRs located in the promoter regions, 4 and 6 regions were found to be either hypo- or hypermethylated, respectively. Importantly, three oncogenes-FOXQ1,TWIST1, andERG-were identified as differentially methylated in mastocytosis patients, for the first time. Functional annotation revealed the most important biological processes in which the differentially methylated genes were involved as transcription, multicellular development, and signal transduction. The biological process related to histone H2A monoubiquitination (GO:0035518) was found to be enriched in association with higher tryptase levels, which may be associated with more aberrant mast cells and, therefore, more atypical mast cell disease. The signal in the BAIAP2 gene was detected in the context of anaphylaxis, but no significant differential methylation was found in the context of allergy. Furthermore, increased expression of genes encoding integral membrane components (GRM2andKRTCAP3) was found in mastocytosis patients. This study confirms that patients with mastocytosis differ significantly in terms of methylation levels in selected CMRs of genes involved in specific molecular processes. The results of gene expression profiling indicate the increased expression of genes belonging to the integral component of the membrane in mastocytosis patients (GRM2andKRTCAP3). Further work is warranted, especially in relation to the disease subvariants, to identify links between the methylation status and the symptoms and novel therapeutic targets."

Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis has emerged as a promising, minimally invasive tool for disease detection and management. Here, we assessed which ctDNA assay might be most suitable for a ctDNA-based CRC screening/surveillance blood test. In this prospective, proof-of-concept study, patients with colonoscopies for Lynch surveillance or the National Colorectal Cancer screening program were included between 7 July 2019 and 3 June 2022. Blood was drawn, and if advanced neoplasia (adenoma with villous component, high-grade dysplasia, ≥10 mm, or CRC) was detected, it was analyzed for chromosomal copy number variations, single nucleotide variants, and genome-wide methylation (MeD-seq). Outcomes were compared with corresponding patients' tissues and the MeD-seq results of healthy blood donors. Two Lynch carriers and eight screening program patients were included: five with CRC and five with advanced adenomas. cfDNA showed copy number variations and single nucleotide variants in one patient with CRC and liver metastases. Eight patients analyzed with MeD-seq showed clustering of Lynch-associated and sporadic microsatellite instable lesions separate from microsatellite stable lesions, as did healthy blood donors. In conclusion, whereas copy number changes and single nucleotide variants were only detected in one patient, cfDNA methylation profiles could discriminate all microsatellite instable advanced neoplasia, rendering this tool particularly promising for LS surveillance. Larger studies are warranted to validate these findings."

N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is involved in many neurodegenerative diseases; however, its role in cognitive impairment after HL has not yet been investigated. Therefore, we aimed to analyze the m6A modification profile of the mouse hippocampus after HL exposure. A mouse model of neomycin-induced HL was established. An auditory brainstem-response test was utilized for detecting hearing threshold. The passive avoidance test was served as the mean for evaluating cognitive function. The m6A-regulated enzyme expression levels were analyzed by using reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-Seq) were performed with the aim of investigating gene expression differences and m6A modification in the mouse hippocampus.Neomycin administration induced severe HL in mice. At four months of age, the mice in the HL group showed poorer cognitive performance than the mice in the control group. METTL14, WTAP, and YTHDF2 mRNA levels were downregulated in the hippocampi of HL mice, whereas ALKBH5 and FTO mRNA levels were significantly upregulated. At the protein level, METTL3 and FTO were significantly upregulated. Methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing analysis revealed 387 and 361 m6A hypermethylation and hypomethylation peaks, respectively. Moreover, combined analysis of mRNA expression levels and m6A peaks revealed eight mRNAs with significantly changed expression levels and methylation.Our findings revealed the m6A transcriptome-wide profile in the hippocampus of HL mice, which may provide a basis for understanding the association between HL and cognitive impairment from the perspective of epigenetic modifications.© 2023.

However, integrative profiling of cfDNA methylome and fragmentome has been technologically challenging. Here, we adapt an enzyme-mediated methylation sequencing method for comprehensive analysis of genome-wide cfDNA methylation, fragmentation, and copy number alteration (CNA) characteristics for enhanced cancer detection. We apply this method to plasma samples of 497 healthy controls and 780 patients of seven cancer types and develop an ensemble classifier by incorporating methylation, fragmentation, and CNA features. In the test cohort, our approach achieves an area under the curve value of 0.966 for overall cancer detection. Detection sensitivity for early-stage patients achieves 73% at 99% specificity. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility to accurately localize the origin of cancer signals with combined methylation and fragmentation profiling of tissue-specific accessible chromatin regions. Overall, this proof-of-concept study provides a technical platform to utilize multimodal cfDNA features for improved cancer detection.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."
,37757859,Diverse regulatory pathways modulate bet hedging of competence induction in epigenetically-differentiated phase variants of Streptococcus pneumoniae.,Nucleic Acids Res,"Despite enabling Streptococcus pneumoniae to acquire antibiotic resistance and evade vaccine-induced immunity, transformation occurs at variable rates across pneumococci. Phase variants of isolate RMV7, distinguished by altered methylation patterns driven by the translocating variable restriction-modification (tvr) locus, differed significantly in their transformation efficiencies and biofilm thicknesses. These differences were replicated when the corresponding tvr alleles were introduced into an RMV7 derivative lacking the locus. RNA-seq identified differential expression of the type 1 pilus, causing the variation in biofilm formation, and inhibition of competence induction in the less transformable variant, RMV7domi. This was partly attributable to RMV7domi's lower expression of ManLMN, which promoted competence induction through importing N-acetylglucosamine. This effect was potentiated by analogues of some proteobacterial competence regulatory machinery. Additionally, one of RMV7domi's phage-related chromosomal island was relatively active, which inhibited transformation by increasing expression of the stress response proteins ClpP and HrcA. However, HrcA increased competence induction in the other variant, with its effects depending on Ca2+ supplementation and heat shock. Hence the heterogeneity in transformation efficiency likely reflects the diverse signalling pathways by which it is affected. This regulatory complexity will modulate population-wide responses to synchronising quorum sensing signals to produce co-ordinated yet stochastic bet hedging behaviour.© The Author(s) 2023.

DNA methylation (DNAm) may mediate these effects. Thus, we conducted meta-analyses of epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) between dietary GI and GL and blood DNAm of children and adolescents.We calculated dietary GI and GL and performed EWAS in children and adolescents (age range: 4.5-17 years) from six cohorts (N = 1,187). We performed stratified analyses of participants with normal weight (n = 801) or overweight or obesity (n = 386). We performed look-ups for the identified cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites (false discovery rate [FDR] <0.05) with tissue-specific gene expression of 832 blood and 223 subcutaneous adipose tissue samples from children and adolescents.Dietary GL was positively associated with DNAm of cg20274553 (FDR <0.05), annotated to WDR27. Several CpGs were identified in the normal-weight (GI: 85; GL: 17) and overweight or obese (GI: 136; GL: 298; FDR <0.05) strata, and none overlapped between strata. In participants with overweight or obesity, identified CpGs were related to RNA expression of genes associated with impaired metabolism (e.g., FRAT1, CSF3).We identified 537 associations between dietary GI and GL and blood DNAm, mainly in children and adolescents with overweight or obesity. High-GI and/or -GL diets may influence epigenetic gene regulation and thereby promote metabolic derangements in young people with increased BMI.© 2023 by the American Diabetes Association."
,37752647,[DNA Methylation Profile of CD14+ Monocytes Changes in Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis].,Mol Biol (Mosk),"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system, which is characterized by significant clinical heterogeneity. Primary progressive MS (PPMS) develops in 10-15% of patients. Unlike the most common relapsing-remitting form of MS, PPMS involves steady progress of neurodegeneration and, as a consequence, a persistent gradual increase in neurological symptoms. The peculiarities of epigenetic regulation of gene expression may be one of the reasons for the differences in the pathogenesis of the two MS forms. DNA methylation is one of the key epigenetic mechanisms, which remains almost unexplored in different cell populations of PPMS patients. The goal of this work was to identify differential methylation profiles of the CpG sites in the CD14+ monocyte DNA, which characterize PPMS. A genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation in PPMS patients and healthy individuals has identified 169 differentially methylated positions (DMPs), 90.5% of which were hypermethylated in PPMS patients. More than half of all DMPs are located in/near known genes and within CpG islands and their neighboring regions, which indicates their high functional significance. We have found six differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in the OR2L13, CAT, LCLAT1, HOXA5, RNF39, and CRTAC1 genes involved in inflammation and neurodegeneration, which indicates active epigenetic regulation of their expression."
,37752189,NA,NA,"Recent reports based on a substantial number of cases, warrant need for population-based research to determine implications of constitutional methylation of tumor suppressor genes such as BRCA1 occurring in healthy tissue in the prediction of cancer. However, the detection of the constitutional methylation in DNA extracted from blood has already been shown to be technologically challenging, mainly because epimutations appear to be present in blood at a very low level. The analytical sensitivity required for low-level methylation detection can be provided by NGS, but this technique is still labor and cost-intensive. We assessed if PCR-based MS-HRM and BeadChip microarray technologies, which are standardized and cost-effective technologies for methylation changes screening, provide a sufficient level of analytical sensitivity for constitutional BRCA1 methylation detection in blood samples. The study included whole blood samples from 67 healthy women, 35 with previously confirmed and 32 with no detectable BRCA1 promoter methylation for which we performed both MS-HRM based BRCA1 gene methylation screening and genome wide methylation profiling with EPIC microarray. Our results shown, that low-level BRCA1 methylation can be effectively detected in DNA extracted from blood by PCR-based MS-HRM. At the same time, EPIC microarray does not provide conclusive results to unambiguously determine the presence of BRCA1 constitutional methylation in MS-HRM epimutation positive samples. The analytical sensitivity of MS-HRM is sufficient to detect low level BRCA1 constitutional epimutation in DNA extracted from blood and BeadChip technology-based microarrays appear not to provide that level of analytical sensitivity.© 2023.

However, it is still controversial whether IM itself is precancerous or paracancerous. Here, we aimed to explore the precancerous nature of IM by analysing epigenetic alterations.Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was conducted by EPIC BeadArray using IM crypts isolated by Alcian blue staining. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing for H3K27ac and single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin by sequencing were conducted using IM mucosa.NOS2was induced using Tet-on gene expression system in normal cells.IM crypts had a methylation profile unique from non-IM crypts, showing extensive DNA hypermethylation in promoter CpG islands, including those of tumour-suppressor genes. Also, the IM-specific methylation profile, namely epigenetic footprint, was present in a fraction of gastric cancers with a higher frequency than expected, and suggested to be associated with good overall survival. IM organoids had remarkably highNOS2expression, andNOS2induction in normal cells led to accelerated induction of aberrant DNA methylation, namely epigenetic instability, by increasing DNA methyltransferase activity. IM mucosa showed dynamic enhancer reprogramming, including the regions involved in higherNOS2expression.NOS2had open chromatin in IM cells but not in gastric cells, and IM cells had frequent closed chromatin of tumour-suppressor genes, indicating their methylation-silencing.NOS2expression in IM-derived organoids was upregulated by interleukin-17A, a cytokine secreted by extracellular bacterial infection.IM cells were considered to have a precancerous nature potentially with an increased chance of converting into cancer cells, and an accelerated DNA methylation induction due to abnormalNOS2expression.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

Identification of flowering master regulators in pigeon pea is highly imperative as indeterminacy and late flowering are impediments towards yield improvement. A genome-wide analysis was performed to explore flowering orthologous groups in pigeon pea. Among the 412 floral orthologs identified in pigeon pea, 148 genes belong to the meristem identity, photoperiod-responsive, and circadian clock-associated ortholog groups. Our comparative genomics study revealed purifying selection pressures (ka/ks) on floral orthologs, and duplication patterns and evolution through synteny with other model species. Phylogenetic analysis of floral genes substantiated a connection between pigeon pea plant architecture and flowering time as all the PEBP domain-containing genes belong to meristem identity floral networks of pigeon pea. Expression profiling of eleven major orthologs in contrasting determinate and indeterminate genotypes indicated that these orthologs might be involved in flowering regulation. Expression of floral inducer, FT, and floral repressor, TFL1, was non-comparable in indeterminate genotypes across all the developmental stages of pigeon pea. However, dynamic FT/TFL1 expression ratio detected in all tissues of both the genotypes suggested their role in floral transition. One TFL1 ortholog having high sequence conserveness across pigeon pea genotypes showed differential expression indicating genotype-dependent regulation of this ortholog. Presence of conserved 6mA-methylation patterns in light-responsive elements and in other cis-regulatory elements of FT and TFL1 across different plant genotypes indicated possible involvement of epigenetic regulation in flowering.© 2023.

,37750176,Evidences of differential methylation in the genome during development in the cactophilic Drosophila species.,Genesis,"DNA methylation with 5-methylcytosine (5mC) has been reported in the genome of several eukaryotes, with marked differences between vertebrates and invertebrates. DNA methylation is poorly understood as its role in evolution in insects. Drosophila gouveai (cluster Drosophila buzzatii) presents larvae that develop obligatorily in necrotic tissues of cacti in nature, with the distribution of populations in South America, and plasticity of phenotypes in insect-plant interaction. We characterize organisms at developmental stages and analyze variations at multiple methylation-sensitive loci in pupae, and adult flies using methylation sensitive amplification polymorphism. We obtained 326 loci with CCGG targets in the genome of D. gouveai. Genomic regions with molecular lengths from 100 to 700 pb were most informative about methylation states. Multiple loci show differences in methylation-sensitive sites (MSL) concerning developmental stages, such as in pupae (MSL = 40), female reproductive tissue (MSL = 76), and male reproductive tissues (MSL = 58).

Flavonoids, including phenols and polyphenols, have a significant role in plant physiology and are synthesized in several tissues. Despite the diverse role of flavonoids, genetic information is limited for flavonoid biosynthesis pathways inA. racemosus. The current study explores full-scale functional genomics information ofA. racemosusbyde novotranscriptome sequencing using Illumina paired-end sequencing technology to elucidate the genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis pathways. Thede novoassembly of high-quality paired-end reads resulted in ∼2.3 million high-quality reads with a pooled transcript of 45,647 comprising ∼76 Mb transcriptome with a mean length (bp) of 1,674 and N50 of 1,868bp. Furthermore, the coding sequence (CDS) prediction analysis from 45,647 pooled transcripts resulted in 45,444 CDS with a total length and mean length of 76,398,686 and 1,674, respectively. The Gene Ontology (GO) analysis resulted in a high number of CDSs assigned to 25,342 GO terms, which grouped the predicted CDS into three main domains, i.e., Biological Process (19,550), Molecular Function (19,873), and Cellular Component (14,577). The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway database was used to categorize 6,353 CDS into 25 distinct biological pathway categories, in which the majority of mapped CDS were shown to be related to translation (645), followed by signal transduction (532), carbohydrate metabolism (524), folding, sorting, and degradation (522). Among these, only ∼64 and 14 CDSs were found to be involved in the phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways, respectively. Quantitative Real-time PCR was used to check the expression profile of fourteen potential flavonoid biosynthesis pathway genes. The qRT-PCR analysis result matches the transcriptome sequence data validating the Illumina sequence results. Moreover, a large number of genes associated with the flavonoids biosynthesis pathway were found to be upregulated under the induction of methyl jasmonate. The present-day study on transcriptome sequence data ofA. racemosuscan be utilized for characterizing genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis pathways and for functional genomics analysis inA. racemosususing the reverse genetics approach (CRISPR/Cas9 technology).Copyright © 2023 Malik, Dwivedi, Rabuma, Kumar, Singh, Kumar, Yogi and Chhokar."

Moreover, high- or low-grade diffuse gliomas, commonly found in adults, also emerge. Recent genomic research has revealed numerous molecular and genetic features of pediatric brain tumors. These molecular and genetic findings have been incorporated into the latest 2021 World Health Organization Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System(WHO CNS 5). WHO CNS 5 introduces separate classifications for adult- and pediatric-type diffuse gliomas, which were conventionally diagnosed using the same criteria. Classifying these adult- and pediatric-type gliomas using histopathological properties alone is challenging. Therefore, molecular diagnostics utilizing diverse molecular and genetic information, including variants, copy number alterations, structural abnormalities, and DNA methylation profiles, are imperative.

To determine the potential contribution of DNA methylation alterations to tumor phenotype in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in both smoker and never-smoker patients, we performed genome-wide profiling of DNA methylation in 17 primary NSCLC tumors and 10 matched normal lung samples using the complementary assays methylation DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP-seq) and methylation sensitive restriction enzyme digestion followed by sequencing (MRE-seq). We reported recurrent methylation changes of several gene promoters, many previously implicated in cancer, including FAM83A and SEPT9 (hypomethylation), as well as PCDH7, NKX2-1, and SOX17 (hypermethylation). Although many methylation changes between tumors and their paired normal samples were shared across patients, several were specific to a particular smoking status. For example, never-smokers displayed a greater proportion of hypomethylated differentially methylated regions (hypoDMRs) and a greater number of recurrently hypomethylated promoters, including those of ASPSCR1, TOP2A, DPP9, and USP39, all previously linked to cancer. Changes outside of promoters were also widespread and often recurrent, particularly methylation loss over repetitive elements, highly enriched for ERV1 subfamilies. Recurrent hypoDMRs were enriched for several transcription factor binding motifs, often for genes involved in signaling and cell proliferation. For example, 71% of recurrent promoter hypoDMRs contained a motif for NKX2-1. Finally, the majority of DMRs were located within an active chromatin state in tissues profiled using the Roadmap Epigenome data, suggesting that methylation changes may contribute to altered regulatory programs through the adaptation of cell type-specific expression programs.Copyright © 2023.

Spatial and temporal heterogeneity of cell subpopulations has been associated with cancer progression and implicated in the prognosis and therapy response. Emerging evidence indicates that aberrant epigenetic profiles in OSCC may foster an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment by modulating the expression of immune-related long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). DNA methylation analysis was performed in 46 matched OSCC and normal adjacent tissue samples using a genome-wide platform (Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip). Reference-based computational deconvolution (MethylCIBERSORT) was applied to infer the immune cell composition of the bulk samples. The expression levels of genes encoding immune markers and differentially methylated lncRNAs were investigated using The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset. OSCC specimens presented distinct immune cell composition, including the enrichment of monocyte lineage cells, natural killer cells, cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, regulatory T-lymphocytes, and neutrophils. In contrast, B-lymphocytes, effector T-lymphocytes, and fibroblasts were diminished in tumor samples. The hypomethylation of three immune-associated lncRNAs (MEG3, MIR155HG, and WFDC21P) at individual CpG sites was confirmed by bisulfite-pyrosequencing. Also, the upregulation of a set of immune markers (FOXP3, GZMB, IL10, IL2RA, TGFB, IFNG, TDO2, IDO1, and HIF1A) was detected. The immune cell composition, immune markers alteration, and dysregulation of immune-associated lncRNAs reinforce the impact of the immune microenvironment in OSCC. These concurrent factors contribute to tumor heterogeneity, suggesting that epi-immunotherapy could be an efficient alternative to treat OSCC.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

Despite ongoing efforts and regulatory measures, BPA exposure among children persists. This study aimed to identify the modifiable factors associated with urinary BPA levels in Korean children and adolescents. We conducted an environment-wide association study (EWAS) using data from the Korean National Environmental Health Survey (KoNEHS) Cycle 4. This study included 578 preschoolers, 736 school-aged children, and 828 adolescents. A total of 117, 103, and 102 modifiable factors were selected from KoNEHS Cycle 4. Each modifiable factor associated with urinary BPA levels was tested using a multivariable linear regression model. Subsequently, multiple testing corrections were performed using false discovery rate (FDR) estimation. For the validation phase, we used the iteration of the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), a machine learning-based regression analysis. After the validation phase of the LASSO regression, two modifiable factors were identified as being significantly related to urinary BPA levels in preschoolers. Urinary cotinine levels and the use of slime or clay toys were positively associated with urinary BPA levels in preschoolers. However, no significant associations were observed between school-aged children and adolescents. Our results suggest novel exposure pathways to BPA in recent lifestyles and contribute to the development of effective prevention strategies. These modifiable factors provide valuable targets for interventions aimed at reducing BPA exposure in children.

The biological function of genes associated with differentially methylated regions (DMRs) was investigated using Gene Ontology functional analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis, using network-based key driver analysis (KDA) to find KDA genes. In clinical samples of SS patients and controls, the expression levels of KDA genes were validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical analysis. Moreover, the diagnostic value of KDA genes for SS was confirmed using receiver operating characteristic curves.We identified 322 DMRs, annotated as 162 associated genes. Six genes were selected via the number of networks of KDA genes. Differential expression of genes such as human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I, ADAR, and OAS2 was observed in patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the minor salivary glands, which can be used as potential diagnostic biomarkers for SS.Clinical sample validation suggested that HLA class I, ADAR, and OAS2 might play a role in the development of SS.

In recent years, extensive (epi-)genomic profiling has identified several glioma subgroups characterized by distinct molecular characteristics, most importantly IDH1/2 and histone H3 mutations. A group of 16 diffuse gliomas classified as ""adult-type diffuse high-grade glioma, IDH-wildtype, subtype F (HGG-F)"" was identified by the DKFZ v12.5 Brain Tumor Classifier. Histopathologic characterization, exome sequencing, and review of clinical data was performed in all cases. Based on unsupervised t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding and clustering analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation data, HGG-F shows distinct epigenetic profiles separate from established central nervous system tumors. Exome sequencing demonstrated frequent TERT promoter (12/15 cases), PIK3R1 (11/16), and TP53 mutations (5/16). Radiologic characteristics were reminiscent of gliomatosis cerebri in 9/14 cases (64%). Histopathologically, most cases were classified as diffuse gliomas (7/16, 44%) or were suspicious for the infiltration zone of a diffuse glioma (5/16, 31%). None of the cases demonstrated microvascular proliferation or necrosis. Outcome of 14 patients with follow-up data was better compared to IDH-wildtype glioblastomas with a median progression-free survival of 58 months and overall survival of 74 months (both P<0.0001). Our series represents a novel type of adult-type diffuse glioma with distinct molecular and clinical features. Importantly, we provide evidence that TERT promoter mutations in diffuse gliomas without further morphologic or molecular signs of high-grade glioma should be interpreted in the context of the clinicoradiologic presentation as well as epigenetic profile and may not be suitable as a standalone marker for glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype.Copyright © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

In this study, based on the published whole-genome data, we identified members of the JAZ gene family in Populus trichocarpa. Through a series of bioinformatic approaches, their expression patterns under various stress conditions have been analyzed to explore and excavate the endogenous resistance genes of poplar and provide a theoretical basis for breeding new varieties of poplar resistance.A total of 13 PtJAZ genes have been identified in P. trichocarpa and designated as PtJAZ1-PtJAZ13. Those 13 PtJAZ genes were unevenly distributed on nine chromosomes, and they could be divided into four subfamilies. The gene structures and motif composition of the members derived from the same subfamily were similar. Collinearity analysis demonstrated that, compared with Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa, the most collinear pairs (13) were found in P. trichocarpa and Eucalyptus robusta. Cis-acting element analysis suggested that the promoter regions of PtJAZs contained a large number of hormones and stress response elements, of which abscisic acid (ABA) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) hormone response elements were the most abundant. The PtJAZ genes not only had diverse expression patterns in different tissues, but they also responded to various abiotic and biotic stress conditions. The co-expression network and GO and KEGG analyses showed that JAZ genes were closely related to insect resistance.In this study, applying bioinformatic methods, 13 PtJAZ gene family members from P. trichocarpa were identified and comprehensively analyzed.

We sought to present a comprehensive analysis of the associations between placental DNA methylation and selective fetal growth restriction (sFGR), which is a severe complication of monochorionic twin pregnancies, characterized by one fetus experiencing restricted growth. Genome-wide methylation analysis was performed on 24 placental samples obtained from 12 monochorionic twins with sFGR (Cohort 1) using Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. Integrative analysis of our EPIC data and two previous placental methylation studies of sFGR (a total of 30 placental samples from 15 sFGR twins) was used to identify convincing differential promoter methylation. Validation analysis was performed on the placentas from 15 sFGR twins (30 placental samples), 15 FGR singletons, and 14 control singletons (Cohort 2) using pyrosequencing, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, western blot, and immunohistochemistry (IHC). A globe shift toward hypomethylation was identified in the placentas of growth-restricted fetuses compared with the placentas of normal fetuses in monochorionic twins, including 5625 hypomethylated CpGs and 452 hypermethylated CpGs, especially in the regions of CpG islands, gene-body and promoters. The analysis of pathways revealed dysregulation primarily in steroid hormone biosynthesis, metabolism, cell adhesion, signaling transduction, and immune response. Integrative analysis revealed a differentially methylated promoter region in the CYP11A1 gene, encoding a rate-limiting enzyme of steroidogenesis converting cholesterol to pregnenolone. The CYP11A1 gene was validated to have hypomethylation and higher mRNA expression in sFGR twins and FGR singletons. In conclusion, our findings suggested that the changes in placental DNA methylation pattern in sFGR may have functional implications for differentially methylated genes and regulatory regions. The study provides reliable evidence for identifying abnormally methylated CYP11A1 gene in the placenta of sFGR.© 2023 Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology."
,37731367,A consistent pattern of slide effects in Illumina DNA methylation BeadChip array data.,Epigenetics,"Background:Recent studies have identified thousands of associations between DNA methylation CpGs and complex diseases/traits, emphasizing the critical role of epigenetics in understanding disease aetiology and identifying biomarkers. However, association analyses based on methylation array data are susceptible to batch/slide effects, which can lead to inflated false positive rates or reduced statistical powerResults:We use multiple DNA methylation datasets based on the popular Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip array to describe consistent patterns and the joint distribution of slide effects across CpGs, confirming and extending previous results. The susceptible CpGs overlap with the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array content.Conclusions:Our findings reveal systematic patterns in slide effects. The observations provide further insights into the characteristics of these effects and can improve existing adjustment approaches."
,37731059,Chromatin remodeling analysis reveals the RdDM pathway responds to low-phosphorus stress in maize.,Plant J,"Chromatin in eukaryotes folds into a complex three-dimensional (3D) structure that is essential for controlling gene expression and cellular function and is dynamically regulated in biological processes. Studies on plant phosphorus signaling have concentrated on single genes and gene interactions. It is critical to expand the existing signaling pathway in terms of its 3D structure. In this study, low-Pi treatment led to greater chromatin volume. Furthermore, low-Pi stress increased the insulation score and the number of TAD-like domains, but the effects on the A/B compartment were not obvious. The methylation levels of target sites (hereafter as RdDM levels) peaked at specific TAD-like boundaries, whereas RdDM peak levels at conserved TAD-like boundaries shifted and decreased sharply. The distribution pattern of RdDM sites originating from the Helitron transposons matched that of genome-wide RdDM sites near TAD-like boundaries. RdDM pathway genes were upregulated in the middle or early stages and downregulated in the later stages under low-Pi conditions. The RdDM pathway mutant ddm1a showed increased tolerance to low-Pi stress, with shortened and thickened roots contributing to higher Pi uptake from the shallow soil layer. ChIP-seq results revealed that ZmDDM1A could bind to Pi- and root development-related genes. Strong associations were found between interacting genes in significantly different chromatin-interaction regions and root traits. These findings not only expand the mechanisms by which plants respond to low-Pi stress through the RdDM pathway but also offer a crucial framework for the analysis of biological issues using 3D genomics.© 2023 Society for Experimental Biology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

Little is known about the mechanisms of CU-related comorbidities. Findings from preclinical and clinical studies have suggested that CU is associated with aberrant DNA methylation (DNAm) that may be influenced by genetic variants [i.e., methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs)]. In this study, we mapped cis-meQTLs for CU-associated DNAm sites (CpGs) in an HIV-positive cohort (Ntotal = 811) and extended the meQTLs to multiple traits.We conducted cis-meQTL analysis for 224 candidate CpGs selected for their association with CU in blood. We identified 7,101 significant meQTLs [false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05], which mostly mapped to genes involved in immunological functions and were enriched in immune pathways. We followed up the meQTLs using phenome-wide association study and trait enrichment analyses, which revealed 9 significant traits. We tested for causal effects of CU on these 9 traits using Mendelian Randomization and found evidence that CU plays a causal role in increasing hypertension (p-value = 2.35E-08) and decreasing heel bone mineral density (p-value = 1.92E-19).These findings suggest that genetic variants for CU-associated DNAm have pleiotropic effects on other relevant traits and provide new insights into the causal relationships between cocaine use and these complex traits.© 2023.

,37729850,Current understanding of genetics and epigenetics in pseudoexfoliation syndrome and glaucoma.,Mol Aspects Med,"Pseudoexfoliation is a complex, progressive, and systemic age-related disorder. The early stage of deposition of extracellular fibrillar material on ocular and extraocular tissues is termed as pseudoexfoliation syndrome (PEXS). The severe advanced stage is known as pseudoexfoliation glaucoma (PEXG), which involves increased intraocular pressure and optic nerve damage. Through genome-wide association and candidate gene studies, PEX has been associated with numerous genetic risk variants in various gene loci. However, the genetic basis of the disease fails to explain certain features of PEX pathology, such as the progressive nature of the disease, asymmetric ocular manifestation, age-related onset, and only a subset of PEXS individuals developing PEXG. Increasing evidence shows an interplay of genetic and epigenetic factors in the pathology of complex, multifactorial diseases. In this review, we have discussed the genetic basis of the disease and the emerging contribution of epigenetic regulations in PEX pathogenesis, focusing on DNA methylation and non-coding RNAs. Aberrant methylation patterns, histone modifications, and post-transcriptional regulation by microRNAs lead to aberrant gene expression changes. We have reviewed these aberrant epigenetic changes in PEX pathology and their effect on molecular pathways associated with PEX. We have further discussed some possible genetic/epigenetic-based diagnoses and therapeutics for PEX. Although studies to understand the role of epigenetic regulations in PEX are just emerging, epigenetic modifications contribute significantly to PEX pathogenesis and may pave the way for better and targeted therapeutics.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

,37727069,Cyclic Stretch Promotes Cellular Reprogramming Process through Cytoskeletal-Nuclear Mechano-Coupling and Epigenetic Modification.,Adv Sci (Weinh),"Advancing the technologies for cellular reprogramming with high efficiency has significant impact on regenerative therapy, disease modeling, and drug discovery. Biophysical cues can tune the cell fate, yet the precise role of external physical forces during reprogramming remains elusive. Here the authors show that temporal cyclic-stretching of fibroblasts significantly enhances the efficiency of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) production. Generated iPSCs are proven to express pluripotency markers and exhibit in vivo functionality. Bulk RNA-sequencing reveales that cyclic-stretching enhances biological characteristics required for pluripotency acquisition, including increased cell division and mesenchymal-epithelial transition. Of note, cyclic-stretching activates key mechanosensitive molecules (integrins, perinuclear actins, nesprin-2, and YAP), across the cytoskeletal-to-nuclear space. Furthermore, stretch-mediated cytoskeletal-nuclear mechano-coupling leads to altered epigenetic modifications, mainly downregulation in H3K9 methylation, and its global gene occupancy change, as revealed by genome-wide ChIP-sequencing and pharmacological inhibition tests. Single cell RNA-sequencing further identifies subcluster of mechano-responsive iPSCs and key epigenetic modifier in stretched cells. Collectively, cyclic-stretching activates iPSC reprogramming through mechanotransduction process and epigenetic changes accompanied by altered occupancy of mechanosensitive genes. This study highlights the strong link between external physical forces with subsequent mechanotransduction process and the epigenetic changes with expression of related genes in cellular reprogramming, holding substantial implications in the field of cell biology, tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine.© 2023 The Authors.

,37720395,NA,NA,"5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) fluorescence-guided resection increases the percentage of complete CNS tumor resections and improves the progression-free survival ofIDH-wildtype glioblastoma patients. A small subset ofIDH-wildtype glioblastoma shows no 5-ALA fluorescence. An explanation for these cases is missing. In this study, we used DNA methylation profiling to further characterize non-fluorescent glioblastomas.Patients with newly diagnosed and recurrentIDH-wildtype glioblastoma that underwent surgery were analyzed. The intensity of intraoperative 5-ALA fluorescence was categorized as non-visible or visible. DNA was extracted from tumors and genome-wide DNA methylation patterns were analyzed using Illumina EPIC (850k) arrays. Furthermore, 5-ALA intensity was measured by flow cytometry on human gliomasphere lines (BT112 and BT145).Of 74 included patients, 12 (16.2%) patients had a non-fluorescent glioblastoma, which were compared to 62 glioblastomas with 5-ALA fluorescence. Clinical characteristics were equally distributed between both groups. We did not find significant differences between DNA methylation subclasses and 5-ALA fluorescence (P= .24). The distribution of cells of the tumor microenvironment was not significantly different between the non-fluorescent and fluorescent tumors. Copy number variations inEGFR andsimultaneous EGFRvIII expression were strongly associated with 5-ALA fluorescence since all non-fluorescent glioblastomas wereEGFR-amplified (P< .01). This finding was also demonstrated in recurrent tumors. Similarly,EGFR-amplified glioblastoma cell lines showed no 5-ALA fluorescence after 24 h of incubation.Our study demonstrates an association between non-fluorescentIDH-wildtype glioblastomas andEGFRgene amplification which should be taken into consideration for recurrent surgery and future studies investigatingEGFR-amplified gliomas.© The Author(s) 2023.

,37718931,Advances in the role of epigenetics in homocysteine-related diseases.,Epigenomics,"Homocysteine has a wide range of biological effects. However, the specific molecular mechanism of its pathogenicity is still unclear. The diseases induced by hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) are called homocysteine-related diseases. Clinical treatment of HHcy is mainly through folic acid and B-complex vitamins, which are not effective in reducing the associated end point events. Epigenetics is the alteration of heritable genes caused by DNA methylation, histone modification, noncoding RNAs and chromatin remodeling without altering the DNA sequence. In recent years the role of epigenetics in homocysteine-associated diseases has been gradually discovered. This article summarizes the latest evidence on the role of epigenetics in HHcy, providing new directions for its prevention and treatment."
,37717058,Systemic epigenome-wide association study of elk treponeme-associated hoof disease.,Sci Rep,"Treponeme-associated hoof disease (TAHD) is an emerging disease of elk (Cervus canadensis) in the U.S. Pacific West. Because environmental epigenetics is the primary molecular process that mediates environmental factor impacts on a host organism and disease, the role of epigenetics in TAHD etiology was examined. The current study was designed to examine potential effects of TAHD on systemic epigenetic modifications in infected elk over a range of TAHD lesion severity. Leg tendons that contain predominantly fibroblast connective tissue cells were used to isolate fibroblast cells for epigenetic analysis in unaffected and TAHD-positive male and female Roosevelt and Rocky Mountain elk. Differential DNA methylation regions (DMRs) between the unaffected and TAHD-positive elk were identified for both female and male elk. The presence of TAHD was associated with alteration of the connective tissue cell epigenetics, and DMR associated genes identified. Therefore, the infected elk were found to have a systemic epigenetic alteration that was associated with the disease, despite pathology being generally limited to feet. If the elk germline epigenetics is altered then generational transmission of susceptibility to TAHD may impact subsequent generations through epigenetic inheritance. This first study of epigenetic changes associated with disease in elk suggests that TAHD promotes a systemic effect on the elk epigenetics which could exert health impacts on the elk.© 2023.

,37715240,Mediating effects of DNA methylation in the association between sleep quality and infertility among women of childbearing age.,BMC Public Health,"This study aims to investigate the association between sleep quality and infertility among women and to explore the mediating effects of DNA methylation in this association.This study is a population-based case-control study. The relationship between sleep quality and infertility was investigated in women with anovulatory infertility (n = 43) and healthy controls (n = 43). Genome-wide DNA methylation was profiled from peripheral blood samples using the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 850k BeadChip. Differentially methylated CpGs between cases and controls were identified using the ChAMP R package. The mediating effect of DNA methylation between sleep quality and infertility among women was investigated using the Bayesian estimation method provided by the R package ""mediation"".The survey included 86 women of reproductive age, with 43 participants each in the case and control groups. The average age of the women was 27.6 ± 2.8 years (case group: 27.8 ± 3.0 years, control group: 27.4 ± 2.7 years). A total of 262 differentially methylated CpGs corresponding to 185 genes were identified. Difficulty falling asleep was a risk factor for infertility in women (OR = 3.69, 95%CI = 1.14, 11.99), and a causal mediation effect of DNA methylation CpGs was found. The mediating effect coefficient for cg08298632 was 0.10 (95%CI = 0.01-0.22), and the proportion of the total effect mediated by this methylation site increased to 64.3%.These results suggest that DNA methylation CpGs (cg08298632) play a significant role in the relationship between difficulty falling asleep and infertility in females. These findings contribute to our understanding of the underlying mechanisms that connect difficulty falling asleep and infertility in women. Further studies are necessary to fully understand the biological significance and potential therapeutic applications of these findings. The identified DNA methylation sites provide new and valuable insights and potential targets for future studies aiming to prevent and treat female infertility.© 2023.

,37714156,Mitotic perturbation is a key mechanism of action of decitabine in myeloid tumor treatment.,Cell Rep,"Decitabine (DAC) is clinically used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Our genome-wide CRISPR-dCas9 activation screen using MDS-derived AML cells indicates that mitotic regulation is critical for DAC resistance. DAC strongly induces abnormal mitosis (abscission failure or tripolar mitosis) in human myeloid tumors at clinical concentrations, especially in those with TP53 mutations or antecedent hematological disorders. This DAC-induced mitotic disruption and apoptosis are significantly attenuated in DNMT1-depleted cells. In contrast, overexpression of Dnmt1, but not the catalytically inactive mutant, enhances DAC-induced mitotic defects in myeloid tumors. We also demonstrate that DAC-induced mitotic disruption is enhanced by pharmacological inhibition of the ATR-CLSPN-CHK1 pathway. These data challenge the current assumption that DAC inhibits leukemogenesis through DNMT1 inhibition and subsequent DNA hypomethylation and highlight the potent activity of DAC to disrupt mitosis through aberrant DNMT1-DNA covalent bonds.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

,37709781,"DNA methylation profiles in individuals with rare, atypical 7q11.23 CNVs correlate with GTF2I and GTF2IRD1 copy number.",NPJ Genom Med,"Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) and 7q11.23 duplication syndrome (Dup7) are rare neurodevelopmental disorders caused by deletion and duplication of a 1.5 Mb region that includes at least five genes with a known role in epigenetic regulation. We have shown that CNV of this chromosome segment causes dose-dependent, genome-wide changes in DNA methylation, but the specific genes driving these changes are unknown. We measured genome-wide whole blood DNA methylation in six participants with atypical CNV of 7q11.23 (three with deletions and three with duplications) using the Illumina HumanMethylation450k array and compared their profiles with those from groups of individuals with classic WBS or classic Dup7 and with typically developing (TD) controls. Across the top 1000 most variable positions we found that only the atypical rearrangements that changed the copy number of GTF2IRD1 and/or GTF2I (coding for the TFII-IRD1 and TFII-I proteins) clustered with their respective syndromic cohorts. This finding was supported by results from hierarchical clustering across a selection of differentially methylated CpGs, in addition to pyrosequencing validation. These findings suggest that CNV of the GTF2I genes at the telomeric end of the 7q11.23 interval is a key contributor to the large changes in DNA methylation that are seen in blood DNA from our WBS and Dup7 cohorts, compared to TD controls. Our findings suggest that members of the TFII-I protein family are involved in epigenetic processes that alter DNA methylation on a genome-wide level.© 2023.

,37709492,NA,NA,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a lethal malignancy. Differentiation from chronic pancreatitis (CP) is currently inaccurate in about one-third of cases. Misdiagnoses in both directions, however, have severe consequences for patients. We set out to identify molecular markers for a clear distinction between PDAC and CP.Genome-wide variations of DNA-methylation, messenger RNA and microRNA level as well as combinations thereof were analysed in 345 tissue samples for marker identification. To improve diagnostic performance, we established a random-forest machine-learning approach. Results were validated on another 48 samples and further corroborated in 16 liquid biopsy samples.Machine-learning succeeded in defining markers to differentiate between patients with PDAC and CP, while low-dimensional embedding and cluster analysis failed to do so. DNA-methylation yielded the best diagnostic accuracy by far, dwarfing the importance of transcript levels. Identified changes were confirmed with data taken from public repositories and validated in independent sample sets. A signature of six DNA-methylation sites in a CpG-island of the protein kinase C beta type gene achieved a validated diagnostic accuracy of 100% in tissue and in circulating free DNA isolated from patient plasma.The success of machine-learning to identify an effective marker signature documents the power of this approach. The high diagnostic accuracy of discriminating PDAC from CP could have tremendous consequences for treatment success, once the result from still a limited number of liquid biopsy samples would be confirmed in a larger cohort of patients with suspected pancreatic cancer.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

,37703462,Activity Guided Azide-methyllysine Photo-trapping for Substrate Profiling of Lysine Demethylases.,J Am Chem Soc,"Reversible post-translational modifications (PTMs) are key to establishing protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions that govern a majority of the signaling pathways in cells. Sequence-specific PTMs are catalyzed by transferases, and their removal is carried out by a class of reverse-acting enzymes termed ""detransferases"". Currently available chemoproteomic approaches have been valuable in characterizing substrates of transferases. However, proteome-wide cataloging of the substrates of detransferases is challenging, mostly due to the loss of the epitope, rendering immunoprecipitation and activity-based methods ineffective. Herein, we develop a general chemoproteomic strategy called crosslinking-assisted substrate identification (CASI) for systematic characterization of cellular targets of detransferases and successfully apply it to lysine demethylases (KDMs) which catalyze the removal of methyl groups from lysine sidechain in histones to modulate gene transcription. By setting up a targeted azido-methylamino photo-reaction deep inside the active site of KDM4, engineered to carryp-azido phenylalanine, we reveal a novel ""demethylome"" that has escaped the traditional methods. The proteomic survey led to the identification of a battery of nonhistone substrates of KDM4, extending the biological footprint of KDM4 beyond its canonical functions in gene transcription. A notable finding of KDM4A-mediated demethylation of an evolutionarily conserved lysine residue in eukaryotic translational initiation factor argues for a much broader role of KDM4A in ribosomal processes. CASI, representing a substantive departure from earlier approaches by shifting focus from simple peptide-based probes to employing full-length photo-activatable demethylases, is poised to be applied to >400 human detransferases, many of which have remained poorly understood due to the lack of knowledge about their cellular targets."

All patients were assessed using the PD Severity Scale-Chinese version before and after treatment. The Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC (850k) BeadChip for genome-wide methylation screening and mRNA sequencing was used in all patients with PD.A total of 701 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were found between responders and non-responders (|Δβ| ≥ 0.06,q< 0.05), and the hyper- and hypomethylated CpG sites were 511 (72.9%) and 190 (27.1%), respectively. Relative to non-responders, there were 59 differential transcripts, of which 20 were downregulated and 39 were upregulated (q< 0.05). However, no differentially expressed genes were identified by mRNA sequencing after correcting for multiple testing (|log2(FC)| > 1,q> 0.05).This preliminary study showed that DMPs might be associated with the treatment response to escitalopram in PD; however, these DMPs need to be verified in large samples.©The Author(s) 2023.

,37699659,Nucleosome repositioning in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Genome Res,"The location of nucleosomes in the human genome determines the primary chromatin structure and regulates access to regulatory regions. However, genome-wide information on deregulated nucleosome occupancy and its implications in primary cancer cells is scarce. Here, we conducted a genome-wide comparison of high-resolution nucleosome maps in peripheral blood B cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and healthy individuals at single-base-pair resolution. Our investigation uncovered significant changes of nucleosome positioning in CLL. Globally, the spacing between nucleosomes-the nucleosome repeat length (NRL)-is shortened in CLL. This effect is stronger in the more aggressive IGHV-unmutated CLL subtype than in the IGHV-mutated CLL subtype. Changes in nucleosome occupancy at specific sites are linked to active chromatin remodeling and reduced DNA methylation. Nucleosomes lost or gained in CLL marks differential binding of 3D chromatin organizers such as CTCF as well as immune response-related transcription factors and delineated mechanisms of epigenetic deregulation. The principal component analysis of nucleosome occupancy in cancer-specific regions allowed the classification of samples between cancer subtypes and normal controls. Furthermore, patients could be better assigned to CLL subtypes according to differential nucleosome occupancy than based on DNA methylation or gene expression. Thus, nucleosome positioning constitutes a novel readout to dissect molecular mechanisms of disease progression and to stratify patients. Furthermore, we anticipate that the global nucleosome repositioning detected in our study, such as changes in the NRL, can be exploited for liquid biopsy applications based on cell-free DNA to stratify patients and monitor disease progression.© 2023 Piroeva et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press."

These tumors are relatively heterogenous in terms of histopathological and molecular features. Our previous transcriptomic profiling of somatotroph tumors revealed three distinct molecular subtypes. This study was aimed to investigate difference in DNA methylation pattern in subtypes of somatotroph PitNETs and its role in distinctive gene expression.Genome-wide DNA methylation was investigated in 48 somatotroph PitNETs with EPIC microarrays. Gene expression was assessed with RNAseq. Bisulfite pyrosequencing and qRT-PCR were used for verifying results of DNA methylation and gene expression.Clustering tumor samples based on methylation data reflected the transcriptome-related classification. Subtype 1 tumors are densely granulated without GNAS mutation, characterized by high expression of NR5A1 (SF-1) and GIPR. The expression of both genes is correlated with specific methylation of gene body and promoter. This subtype has lower methylation level of 5' gene regions and CpG islands than the remaining tumors. Subtype 2 PitNETs are densely granulated, frequently GNAS-mutated while those in subtype 3 are mainly sparsely granulated. Methylation/expression analysis indicates that ~50% genes located in differentially methylated regions are those differentially expressed between tumor subtypes. Correlation analysis revealed DNA methylation-controlled genes including CDKN1B, CCND2, EBF3, CDH4, CDH12, MGMT, STAT5A, PLXND1, PTPRE, MMP16 and genes encoding ion channels and semaphorins.DNA methylation profiling confirmed the existence of three molecular subtypes of somatotroph PitNETs.

,37697352,Low levels of circulating methylated IRX3 are related to worse outcome after transcatheter aortic valve implantation in patients with severe aortic stenosis.,Clin Epigenetics,"Aortic stenosis (AS) is one of the most common cardiac diseases and major cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is performed in such patients with symptomatic severe AS and reduces mortality for the majority of these patients. However, a significant percentage dies within the first two years after TAVI, such that there is an interest to identify parameters, which predict outcome and could guide pre-TAVI patient selection. High levels of cardiac fibrosis have been identified as such independent predictor of cardiovascular mortality after TAVI. Promoter hypermethylation commonly leads to gene downregulation, and the Iroquois homeobox 3 (IRX3) gene was identified in a genome-wide transcriptome and methylome to be hypermethylated and downregulated in AS patients. In a well-described cohort of 100 TAVI patients in which cardiac fibrosis levels were quantified histologically in cardiac biopsies, and which had a follow-up of up to two years, we investigated if circulating methylated DNA of IRX3 in the peripheral blood is associated with cardiac fibrosis and/or mortality in AS patients undergoing TAVI and thus could serve as a biomarker to add information on outcome after TAVI.Patients with high levels of methylation in circulating IRX3 show a significantly increased survival as compared to patients with low levels of IRX3 methylation indicating that high peripheral IRX3 methylation is associated with an improved outcome. In the multivariable setting, peripheral IRX3 methylation acts as an independent predictor of all-cause mortality. While there is no significant correlation of levels of IRX3 methylation with cardiac death, there is a significant but very weak inverse correlation between circulating IRX3 promoter methylation level and the amount of cardiac fibrosis. Higher levels of peripheral IRX3 methylation further correlated with decreased cardiac IRX3 expression and vice versa.High levels of IRX3 methylation in the blood of AS patients at the time of TAVI are associated with better overall survival after TAVI and at least partially reflect myocardial IRX3 expression.

Whether DNA methylation (DNAm) plays a role in the molecular mechanisms underlying the associations between birth season and lifelong phenotypes remains unclear.We carried out epigenome-wide meta-analyses within the Pregnancy And Childhood Epigenetic Consortium to identify associations of DNAm with birth season, both at differentially methylated probes (DMPs) and regions (DMRs). Associations were examined at two time points: at birth (21 cohorts, N = 9358) and in children aged 1-11 years (12 cohorts, N = 3610). We conducted meta-analyses to assess the impact of latitude on birth season-specific associations at both time points.We identified associations between birth season and DNAm (False Discovery Rate-adjusted p values < 0.05) at two CpGs at birth (winter-born) and four in the childhood (summer-born) analyses when compared to children born in autumn. Furthermore, we identified twenty-six differentially methylated regions (DMR) at birth (winter-born: 8, spring-born: 15, summer-born: 3) and thirty-two in childhood (winter-born: 12, spring and summer: 10 each) meta-analyses with few overlapping DMRs between the birth seasons or the two time points. The DMRs were associated with genes of known functions in tumorigenesis, psychiatric/neurological disorders, inflammation, or immunity, amongst others. Latitude-stratified meta-analyses [higher (≥ 50°N), lower (< 50°N, northern hemisphere only)] revealed differences in associations between birth season and DNAm by birth latitude. DMR analysis implicated genes with previously reported links to schizophrenia (LAX1), skin disorders (PSORS1C, LTB4R), and airway inflammation including asthma (LTB4R), present only at birth in the higher latitudes (≥ 50°N).In this large epigenome-wide meta-analysis study, we provide evidence for (i) associations between DNAm and season of birth that are unique for the seasons of the year (temporal effect) and (ii) latitude-dependent variations in the seasonal associations (spatial effect). DNAm could play a role in the molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of birth season on adult health outcomes.© 2023. BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature."
,37696874,A higher dysregulation burden of brain DNA methylation in female patients implicated in the sex bias of Schizophrenia.,Mol Psychiatry,"Sex differences are pervasive in schizophrenia (SCZ), but the extent and magnitude of DNA methylation (DNAm) changes underlying these differences remain uncharacterized. In this study, sex-stratified differential DNAm analysis was performed in postmortem brain samples from 117 SCZ and 137 controls, partitioned into discovery and replication datasets. Three differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were identified (adj.p < 0.05) in females and 29 DMPs in males without overlap between them. Over 81% of these sex-stratified DMPs were directionally consistent between sexes but with different effect sizes. Females experienced larger magnitude of DNAm changes and more DMPs (based on data of equal sample size) than males, contributing to a higher dysregulation burden of DNAm in females SCZ. Additionally, despite similar proportions of female-related DMPs (fDMPs, 8%) being under genetic control compared with males (10%), significant enrichment of DMP-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in signals of genome-wide association studies was identified only in fDMPs. One DMP in each sex connected the SNPs and gene expression of CALHM1 in females and CCDC149 in males. PPI subnetworks revealed that both female- and male-related differential DNAm interacted with synapse-related dysregulation. Immune-related pathways were unique for females and neuron-related pathways were associated with males. This study reveals remarkable quantitative differences in DNAm-related sexual dimorphism in SCZ and that females have a higher dysregulation burden of SCZ-associated DNAm than males.© 2023.

Cases were chart review-confirmed metastasis, and controls were matched using density sampling. We extracted DNA from the cancerous areas in the archived diagnostic tissue blocks. We used Illumina's Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip for methylation interrogation. We used conditional logistic regression and Bonferroni's correction to identify methylation markers associated with metastasis. In a separate validation cohort (2007), we evaluated the added predictive utility of the methylation score beyond clinical risk score.Among 215 cases and 404 controls, 31 CpG sites were significantly associated with metastasis status. Adding the methylation score to the clinical risk score did not meaningfully improve the c-statistic (0.80-0.81) in the validation cohort, though the score itself was statistically significant (p < 0.01). In the validation cohort, both clinical risk score alone and methylation marker score alone are well calibrated for predicted 10-year metastasis risks. Adding the methylation score to the clinical risk score only marginally improved predictive risk calibration.Our findings do not support the use of these markers to improve clinical risk prediction. The methylation markers identified may inform novel hypothesis in the roles of these genetic regions in metastasis development.© 2023 The Authors.

,37693517,Severe preeclampsia is not associated with significant DNA methylation changes but cell proportion changes in the cord blood - caution on the importance of confounding adjustment.,medRxiv,"Epigenome-wide DNA methylation analysis (EWAS) is an important approach to identify biomarkers for early disease detection and prognosis prediction, yet its results could be confounded by other factors such as cell-type heterogeneity and patient characteristics. In this study, we address the importance of confounding adjustment by examining DNA methylation patterns in cord blood exposed to severe preeclampsia (PE), a prevalent and potentially fatal pregnancy complication. Without such adjustment, a misleading global hypomethylation pattern is obtained. However, after adjusting cell type proportions and patient clinical characteristics, most of the so-called significant CpG methylation changes associated with severe PE disappear. Rather, the major effect of PE on cord blood is through the proportion changes in different cell types. These results are validated using a previously published cord blood DNA methylation dataset, where global hypomethylation pattern was also wrongfully obtained without confounding adjustment. Additionally, several cell types significantly change as gestation progress (eg. granulocyte, nRBC, CD4T, and B cells), further confirming the importance of cell type adjustment in EWAS study of cord blood tissues. Our study urges the community to perform confounding adjustments in EWAS studies, based on cell type heterogeneity and other patient characteristics."
,37693315,NA,NA,"Renal carcinomas are a group of malignant tumors often originating in the cells lining the small tubes in the kidney responsible for filtering waste from the blood and urine production. Kidney tumors arise from the uncontrolled growth of cells in the kidneys and are responsible for a large share of global cancer-related morbidity and mortality. Understanding the molecular mechanisms driving renal carcinoma progression results crucial for the development of targeted therapies leading to an improvement of patient outcomes. Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation are known factors underlying the development of several cancer types. There is solid experimental evidence of relevant biological functions modulated by methylation-related genes, associated with the progression of different carcinomas. Those mechanisms can often be associated to different epigenetic marks, such as DNA methylation sites or chromatin conformation patterns. Currently, there is no definitive method to establish clear relations between genetic and epigenetic factors that influence the progression of cancer. Here, we developed a data-driven method to find methylation-related genes, so we could find relevant bonds between gene co-expression and methylation-wide-genome regulation patterns able to drive biological processes during the progression of clear cell renal carcinoma (ccRC). With this approach, we found out genes such as ITK oncogene that appear hypomethylated during all four stages of ccRC progression and are strongly involved in immune response functions. Also, we found out relevant tumor suppressor genes such as RAB25 hypermethylated, thus potentially avoiding repressed functions in the AKT signaling pathway during the evolution of ccRC. Our results have relevant implications to further understand some epigenetic-genetic-affected roles underlying the progression of renal cancer.Copyright © 2023 Zamora-Fuentes, Hernández-Lemus and Espinal-Enríquez."

Compared to a standard tissue biopsy, performing a liquid biopsy incurs minimal invasiveness, captures comprehensive disease representation, and can be more sensitive at an early stage. Recent genome-wide liquid biopsy studies in prostate cancer analyzing plasma samples have provided insights into the genome and epigenome dynamics during disease progression. In-depth genomic sequencing can offer a comprehensive understanding of cancer evolution, enabling more accurate clinical decision-making. Furthermore, exploring beyond the DNA sequence itself provides opportunities to investigate the regulatory mechanisms underlying various disease phenotypes.

,37691926,NA,NA,"The Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) locus associates with a variety of complex diseases, particularly autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. The HLA-DR15 haplotype, for example, confers the major risk for developing Multiple Sclerosis in Caucasians, pinpointing an important role in the etiology of this chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system. In addition to the protein-coding variants that shape the functional HLA-antigen-T cell interaction, recent studies suggest that the levels of HLA molecule expression, that are epigenetically controlled, also play a role in disease development. However, deciphering the exact molecular mechanisms of the HLA association has been hampered by the tremendous genetic complexity of the locus and a lack of robust approaches to investigate it. Here, we developed a method to specifically enrich the genomic DNA from the HLA class II locus (chr6:32,426,802-34,167,129) and proximal promoters of 2,157 immune-relevant genes, utilizing the Agilent RNA-based SureSelect Methyl-Seq Capture related method, followed by sequencing to detect genetic and epigenetic variation. We demonstrated successful simultaneous detection of the genetic variation and quantification of DNA methylation levels in HLA locus. Moreover, by the detection of differentially methylated positions in promoters of immune-related genes, we identified relevant pathways following stimulation of cells. Taken together, we present a method that can be utilized to study the interplay between genetic variance and epigenetic regulation in the HLA class II region, potentially, in a wide disease context.Copyright © 2023 Kalomoiri, Prakash, Lagström, Hauschulz, Ewing, Shchetynsky, Kular, Needhamsen and Jagodic."
,37690743,NA,NA,"Parabens have been used for decades as preservatives in food, drugs and cosmetics. The majority however, were banned in 2009 and 2014 leaving only methyl-, ethyl-, propyl-, and butyl-derivates available for subsequent use. Methyl- and propylparaben have been extensively tested in vivo, with no resulting evidence for developmental and reproductive toxicity (DART). In contrast, ethylparaben has not yet been tested for DART in animal experiments, and it is currently debated if additional animal studies are warranted. In order to perform a comparison of the four currently approved parabens, we used a previously established in vitro test based on human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) that are exposed to test substances during their differentiation to neuroectodermal cells. EC50values for cytotoxicity were 906 μM, 698 μM, 216 μM and 63 μM for methyl-, ethyl-, propyl- and butylparaben, respectively, demonstrating that cytotoxicity increases with increasing alkyl chain length. Genome-wide analysis demonstrated that FDR-adjusted significant gene expression changes occurred only at cytotoxic or close to cytotoxic concentrations, for example 1720 differentially expressed genes (DEG) at 1000 μM ethylparaben, 1 DEG at 316 μM, and no DEG at 100 μM or lower concentrations. The highest concentration of ethylparaben that did not induce any cytotoxicity nor DEG was 1670-fold above the highest concentration reported in biomonitoring studies (60 nM ethylparaben in cord blood). In conclusion, cytotoxicity and gene expression alterations of ethylparaben occurred at concentrations of approximately three orders of magnitude above human blood concentrations; moreover, the substance fitted well into a scenario where toxicity increases with the alkyl chain length, and gene expression changes only occur at cytotoxic or close to cytotoxic concentrations. Therefore, no evidence was obtained suggesting that in vivo DART with ethylparaben would lead to different results as the methyl- or propyl derivates.Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier B.V."
,37690595,Accelerated epigenetic clock aging in maternal peripheral blood and preterm birth.,Am J Obstet Gynecol,"Epigenetic clocks use CpG DNA methylation (DNAm) to estimate biologic age; acceleration is associated with cancer, heart disease, and shorter lifespan. Few studies evaluate DNAm age and pregnancy outcomes. AgeAccelGrim is a novel epigenetic clock that combines seven DNAm components.We sought to determine if maternal biologic aging (via AgeAccelGrim) is associated with early PTB.A prospective cohort of patients with singleton gestations and at high risk for spontaneous preterm birth (PTB) delivering at a tertiary University hospital were included in this study. Genome-wide CpG methylation was measured using the Illumina® EPIC BeadChip from maternal blood samples obtained <28 weeks' gestation. AgeAccelGrim and its seven DNAm components were estimated by the Horvath DNAm age online tool; positive values are associated with accelerated biologic aging whereas negative values are associated with slower biologic aging relative to each subject's age. The primary outcome was PTB <34 weeks (any indication); secondary outcomes were PTB <37 and <28 weeks. AgeAccelGrim was analyzed as a continuous variable and in quartiles; exploratory analyses evaluated each of the seven DNAm components included in the composite AgeAccelGrim. Data were analyzed by chi-square, t-test, rank-sum, logistic regression (controlling a priori for maternal age, cell counts, low socioeconomic status, and gestational age at time of sample collection), and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses; the log-rank test was used to test the equality of the survival functions.163 patients met inclusion criteria; 48% delivered <37, 39% <34, and 21% <28 weeks' gestation. The median AgeAccelGrim was -0.35 (IQR -2.24, 1.31) years for those delivering at term; those delivering preterm had higher AgeAccelGrim values that were inversely proportional to delivery gestational age [PTB <37 = +0.40 (IQR -1.21, +2.28) years; <34 = +0.51 (IQR -1.05, +2.67 years, and <28 = +1.05 (IQR -0.72, +2.72) years],. Estimated DNAm of the seven epigenetic clock components values were increased among those with PTB <34 weeks' gestation, although differences were only significant for DNAm of plasminogen activation inhibitor 1. In regression models, AgeAcccelGrim was associated with an elevated risk of PTB with increasing magnitude for increasing severity of PTB. For each one-year increase in AgeAccelGrim value (ie. each one-year increase in biologic age compared to chronologic age), the adjusted odds of PTB were 11% (aOR 1.11, 95% CI 1.00-1.24), 13% (aOR 1.13, 95% CI 1.01-1.26) and 18% (aOR 1.18, 95% CI 1.04-1.35) higher for PTB <37 weeks', <34 weeks' and <28 weeks' respectively. Similarly, individuals with accelerated biologic aging (≥75thpercentile AgeAccelGrim) had over double the odds of PTB <34 weeks' (aOR 2.36, 95% CI 1.10-5.08) and over triple the odds of PTB <28 weeks' (aOR 3.89, 95% CI 1.61-9.38). The adjusted odds ratio for PTB <37 weeks' gestation was 1.73, but spanned the null (aOR 1.73, 95% CI 0.81-3.69). In Kaplan-Meier survival analyses, those in the highest AgeAccelGrim quartile delivered earliest (log-rank p< 0.001).Accelerated biologic aging is associated with PTB among high-risk patients.

,37690221,Maternal exposure to sunlight-irradiated graphene oxide induces neurodegeneration-like symptoms in zebrafish offspring through intergenerational translocation and genomic DNA methylation alterations.,Environ Int,"The physiochemical properties of graphene oxide may be affected by sunlight irradiation. However, the underlying mechanisms that alter the properties and subsequent intergenerational effects are not sufficiently investigate. Epigenetics is an early sensitive marker for the intergenerational effects of nanomaterial exposure due to the epigenetic memory. In this study, we investigate changes in the physicochemical properties and the intergenerational effects of maternal exposure to simulated sunlight-irradiated polyethyleneimine-functionalized graphene oxide (SL-PEI-GO). Results show that the physicochemical properties of polyethyleneimine-functionalized graphene oxide (PEI-GO) can be altered significantly by the oxidation of carbon atoms with unpaired electrons present in the defects and on the edges of PEI-GO by sunlight. First, the positive charges, sharp edges, defects and disordered structures of SL-PEI-GO make it translocate from maternal zebrafish to offspring, thus catalyzing the production of reactive oxygen species and damaging mitochondria directly. In addition, changes in DNA methylation reduce the expression of protocadherin1a, protocadherin19 and cadherin4, thus destroying cell membrane integrity, cell adhesion and Ca2+binding. The alteration of DNA methylation induced by maternal exposure activates the Ca2+-CaMKK-brsk2a pathway, which catalyzes the phosphorylation of Tau and eventually results in the appearance of neurodegeneration-like symptoms, including the loss of neurons and neurobehavioral disorders. This study demonstrates that maternal exposure to SL-PEI-GO induces clear neurodegeneration-like symptoms in offspring through both the intergenerational translocation of nanomaterials and differential DNA methylation. These findings may provide new insights into the health risks of nanomaterials altered by nature conditions.Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved."

Epigenetic variation is increasingly recognized as a mechanism that can facilitate rapid responses to changing environmental cues. To investigate variation in genetic and epigenetic diversity at spatial and thermal extremes, we use whole genome and methylome sequencing to generate a high-resolution map of DNA methylation in the bumble bee Bombus vosnesenskii. We sample two populations representing spatial and environmental range extremes (a warm southern low-elevation site and a cold northern high-elevation site) previously shown to exhibit differences in thermal tolerance and determine positions in the genome that are consistently and variably methylated across samples. Bisulfite sequencing reveals methylation characteristics similar to other arthropods, with low global CpG methylation but high methylation concentrated in gene bodies and in genome regions with low nucleotide diversity. Differentially methylated sites (n = 2066) were largely hypomethylated in the northern high-elevation population but not related to local sequence differentiation. The concentration of methylated and differentially methylated sites in exons and putative promoter regions suggests a possible role in gene regulation, and this high-resolution analysis of intraspecific epigenetic variation in wild Bombus suggests that the function of methylation in niche adaptation would be worth further investigation.© 2023.

With 354 ACPA-positive RA patients and 335 normal controls selected from a case-control study based on Swedish population, we conducted the first RA epigenome-wide meplotype association study using our software EWAS2.0, mainly including (i) converted the β value to methylation genotype (menotype) data, (ii) identified methylation disequilibrium (MD) block, (iii) calculated frequent of each meplotypes in MD block and performed case-control association test and (iv) screened for RA-risk meplotypes by odd ratio (OR) and p-values. Ultimately, 545 meplotypes on 334 MD blocks were identified significantly associated with RA (p-value < .05). These meplotypes were mapped to 329 candidate genes related to RA. Subsequently, combined with gene optimization, eight RA-risk meplotypes were identified on three risk genes: HLA-DRB1, HLA-DRB5 and HLA-DQB1. Our results reported the relationship between DNA methylation pattern on HLA-DQB1 and the risk of RA for the first time, demonstrating the co-demethylation of 'cg22984282' and 'cg13423887' on HLA-DQB1 gene (meplotype UU, p-value = 2.90E - 6, OR = 1.68, 95% CI = [1.35, 2.10]) may increase the risk of RA.

,37688320,Epigenomic signature of accelerated ageing in progeroid Cockayne syndrome.,Aging Cell,"Cockayne syndrome (CS) and UV-sensitive syndrome (UVSS) are rare genetic disorders caused by mutation of the DNA repair and multifunctional CSA or CSB protein, but only CS patients display a progeroid and neurodegenerative phenotype, providing a unique conceptual and experimental paradigm. As DNA methylation (DNAm) remodelling is a major ageing marker, we performed genome-wide analysis of DNAm of fibroblasts from healthy, UVSS and CS individuals. Differential analysis highlighted a CS-specific epigenomic signature (progeroid-related; not present in UVSS) enriched in three categories: developmental transcription factors, ion/neurotransmitter membrane transporters and synaptic neuro-developmental genes. A large fraction of CS-specific DNAm changes were associated with expression changes in CS samples, including in previously reported post-mortem cerebella. The progeroid phenotype of CS was further supported by epigenomic hallmarks of ageing: the prediction of DNAm of repetitive elements suggested an hypomethylation of Alu sequences in CS, and the epigenetic clock returned a marked increase in CS biological age respect to healthy and UVSS cells. The epigenomic remodelling of accelerated ageing in CS displayed both commonalities and differences with other progeroid diseases and regular ageing. CS shared DNAm changes with normal ageing more than other progeroid diseases do, and included genes functionally validated for regular ageing. Collectively, our results support the existence of an epigenomic basis of accelerated ageing in CS and unveil new genes and pathways that are potentially associated with the progeroid/degenerative phenotype.© 2023 The Authors.

To understand their functions in the double-flower formation ofPrunus campanulata'Plena' (hereafter referred to as PCP), which is an excellent flowering cherry cultivar, we performed genome-wide identification of the MADS-box gene family. In this study, 71 MADS-box genes were identified and grouped into the Mα, Mβ, Mγ and MIKC subfamilies according to their structures and phylogenetic relationships. All 71 MADS-box genes were located on eight chromosomes of PCP. Analysis of the cis-acting elements in the promoter region of MADS-box genes indicated that they were associated mainly with auxin, abscisic acid, gibberellin, MeJA (methyl jasmonate), and salicylic acid responsiveness, which may be involved in floral development and differentiation. By observing the floral organ phenotype, we found that the double-flower phenotype of PCP originated from petaloid stamens. The analysis of MIKC-type MADS-box genes in PCP vegetative and floral organs by qRT-PCR revealed six upregulated genes involved in petal development and three downregulated genes participating in stamen identity. Comparative analysis of petaloid stamens and normal stamens also indicated that the expression level of theAGgene (PcMADS40) was significantly reduced. Thus, we speculated that these upregulated and downregulated genes, especiallyPcMADS40, may lead to petaloid stamen formation and thus double flowers. This study lays a theoretical foundation for MADS-box gene identification and classification and studying the molecular mechanism underlying double flowers in other ornamental plants."

However, the role ofGeBPinBrassica raparemains unclear. This study identifies 20BrGeBPgenes distributed across 6 chromosomes, categorized into 4 subfamilies. Analysis of their promoter sequences reveals multiple stress-related elements, including those responding to drought, low temperature, methyl jasmonate (MeJA), and gibberellin (GA). Gene expression profiling demonstrates wide expression ofBrGeBPsin callus, stem, silique, and flower tissues. Notably,BrGeBP5expression significantly decreases under low-temperature treatment, whileBrGeBP3andBrGeBP14show increased expression during drought stress, followed by a decrease. Protein interaction predictions suggest thatBrGeBP14homolog,At5g28040, can interact with DES1, a known stress-regulating protein. Additionally, microRNA172 targetingBrGeBP5is upregulated under cold tolerance. These findings underscore the vital role ofBrGeBPsin abiotic stress tolerance. Specifically,BrGeBP3,BrGeBP5,andBrGeBP14show great potential for regulating abiotic stress. This study contributes to understanding the function ofBrGeBPsand provides valuable insights for studying abiotic stress inB. rapa."
,37686289,NA,NA,"Meningiomas are common intracranial tumors in adults. Abnormal microRNA (miRNA) expression plays a role in their pathogenesis. Change in miRNA expression level can be caused by impaired epigenetic regulation of miRNA-encoding genes. We found the genomic region covering theMIR193Bgene to be DNA hypermethylated in meningiomas based on analysis of genome-wide methylation (HumanMethylation450K Illumina arrays). Hypermethylation ofMIR193Bwas also confirmed via bisulfite pyrosequencing. Both hsa-miR-193b-3p and hsa-miR-193b-5p are downregulated in meningiomas. Lower expression of hsa-miR-193b-3p and higherMIR193Bmethylation was observed in World Health Organization (WHO) grade (G) II/III tumors as compared to GI meningiomas.CCND1mRNA was identified as a target of hsa-miR-193b-3p as further validated using luciferase reporter assay in IOMM-Lee meningioma cells. IOMM-Lee cells transfected with hsa-miR-193b-3p mimic showed a decreased cyclin D1 level and lower cell viability and proliferation, confirming the suppressive nature of this miRNA. Cyclin D1 protein expression (immunoreactivity) was higher in atypical than in benign meningiomas, accordingly to observations of lower hsa-miR-193b-3p levels in GII tumors. The commonly observed hypermethylation ofMIR193Bin meningiomas apparently contributes to the downregulation of hsa-miR-193b-3p. Since hsa-miR-193b-3p regulates proliferation of meningioma cells through negative regulation of cyclin D1 expression, it seems to be an important tumor suppressor in meningiomas."
,37683959,NA,NA,"Different cell types in the brain play distinct roles in Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. Late onset AD (LOAD) is a complex disease, with a large genetic component, but many risk loci fall in non-coding genome regions. Epigenetics implicates the non-coding genome with control of gene expression. The epigenome is highly cell-type specific and dynamically responds to the environment. Therefore, epigenetic mechanisms are well placed to explain genetic and environmental factors that are associated with AD. However, given this cellular specificity, purified cell populations or single cells need to be profiled to avoid effect masking. Here we review the current state of cell-type specific genome-wide profiling in LOAD, covering DNA methylation (CpG, CpH, and hydroxymethylation), histone modifications, and chromatin changes. To date, these data reveal that distinct cell types contribute and react differently to AD progression through epigenetic alterations. This review addresses the current gap in prior bulk-tissue derived work by spotlighting cell-specific changes that govern the complex interplay of cells throughout disease progression and are critical in understanding and developing effective treatments for AD.Copyright © 2023.

,37683000,NA,NA,"Disease emergence is accelerating with global changes. Understanding by which mechanisms host populations can rapidly adapt will be crucial for management practices. Pacific oyster mortality syndrome (POMS) imposes a substantial and recurrent selective pressure on oyster populations, and rapid adaptation may arise through genetics and epigenetics. In this study, we used (epi)genome-wide association mapping to show that oysters differentially exposed to POMS displayed genetic and epigenetic signatures of selection. Consistent with higher resistance to POMS, the genes targeted included many genes in several pathways related to immunity. By combining correlation, DNA methylation quantitative trait loci, and variance partitioning, we revealed that a third of phenotypic variation was explained by interactions between the genetic and epigenetic information, ~14% by the genome, and up to 25% by the epigenome alone. Similar to genetically based adaptation, epigenetic mechanisms notably governing immune responses can contribute substantially to the rapid adaptation of hosts to emerging infectious diseases."
,37682835,NA,NA,"DNA cytosine methylation is an epigenetic mechanism involved in regulation of plant responses to biotic and abiotic stress and its ability to change can vary with the sequence context in which a cytosine appears (CpG, CHG, CHH, where H = Adenine, Thymine, Cytosine). Quantification of DNA methylation in model plant species is frequently addressed by Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), which requires a good-quality reference genome. Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS) is a cost-effective potential alternative for ecological research with limited genomic resources and large experimental designs. In this study, we provide for the first time a comprehensive comparison between the outputs of RRBS and WGBS to characterize DNA methylation changes in response to a given environmental factor. In particular, we used epiGBS (recently optimized RRBS) and WGBS to assess global and sequence-specific differential methylation after insect and artificial herbivory in clones of Populus nigra cv. 'italica'. We found that, after any of the two herbivory treatments, global methylation percentage increased in CHH, and the shift was detected as statistically significant only by epiGBS. As regards to loci-specific differential methylation induced by herbivory (cytosines in epiGBS and regions in WGBS), both techniques indicated the specificity of the response elicited by insect and artificial herbivory, together with higher frequency of hypo-methylation in CpG and hyper-methylation in CHH. Methylation changes were mainly found in gene bodies and intergenic regions when present at CpG and CHG and in transposable elements and intergenic regions at CHH context. Thus, epiGBS succeeded to characterize global, genome-wide methylation changes in response to herbivory in the Lombardy poplar. Our results support that epiGBS could be particularly useful in large experimental designs aimed to explore epigenetic changes of non-model plant species in response to multiple environmental factors.Copyright: © 2023 Troyee et al.

,37682473,Identification of Plant Transcription Factor DNA-Binding Sites Using seq-DAP-seq.,Methods Mol Biol,"The identification of genome-wide transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) is a critical step in deciphering gene and transcriptional regulatory networks. However, determining the genome-wide binding of specific TFs or TF complexes remains a technical challenge. DNA affinity purification sequencing (DAP-seq) and modifications such as sequential DAP-seq (seq-DAP-seq) are robust in vitro methods for mapping individual TF or TF complex binding sites in a genome-wide manner. DAP-seq protocols use a genomic DNA (gDNA) library from any target organism with or without amplification, allowing the determination of TF binding on naked or endogenously modified DNA, respectively. As a first step, the gDNA is fragmented to ~200 bp, end-repaired, and sequencing adaptors are added. This gDNA library can be used directly or an amplification step may be performed to remove DNA modifications such as cytosine methylation. DNA libraries are then incubated with an affinity-tagged TF or TF- complex immobilized on magnetic beads. The TF or TF complex of interest is generally produced using recombinant protein expression and purified prior to DNA affinity purification. After incubation of the DNA library with the immobilized TF of interest, multiple wash steps are performed to reduce non-specific DNA binding and the TF-DNA complexes eluted. The eluted DNA is PCR-amplified and sequenced using next-generation sequencing. The resulting sequence reads are mapped to the corresponding reference genome, identifying direct potential bound regions and binding sites of the TF or TF complex of interest. Predictive TFBS models are generated from the bound regions using downstream bioinformatics analysis pipelines. Here, we present a detailed protocol outlining the steps required for seq-DAP-seq of a heterooligomeric TF complex (Fig. 1) and briefly describe the downstream bioinformatics pipeline used to develop a robust TFBS model from sequencing data generated from a DAP-seq experiment.© 2023.

,37682471,NA,NA,"Capturing the dynamic and transient interactions of a transcription factor (TF) with its genome-wide targets whose regulation leads to plants' adaptation to their changing environment is a major technical challenge. This is a widespread problem with biochemical methods such as chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) which are biased towards capturing stable TF-target gene interactions. Herein, we describe how DNA adenine methyltransferase identification and sequencing (DamID-seq) can be used to capture both transient and stable TF-target interactions by DNA methylation. The DamID technique uses a TF protein fused to a DNA adenine methyltransferase (Dam) from E. coli. When expressed in a plant cell, the Dam-TF fusion protein will methylate adenine (A) bases near the sites of TF-DNA interactions. In this way, DamID results in a permanent, stable DNA methylation mark on TF-target gene promoters, even if the target gene is only transiently ""touched"" by the Dam-TF fusion protein. Here we provide a step-by-step protocol to perform DamID-seq experiments in isolated plant cells for any Dam-TF fusion protein of interest. We also provide information that will enable researchers to analyze DamID-seq data to identify TF-binding sites in the genome. Our protocol includes instructions for vector cloning of the Dam-TF fusion proteins, plant cell protoplast transfections, DamID preps, library preparation, and sequencing data analysis. The protocol outlined in this chapter is performed in Arabidopsis thaliana, however, the DamID-seq workflow developed in this guide is broadly applicable to other plants and organisms.© 2023.

,37681359,Genome-wide methylation patterns from canine nanopore assemblies.,G3 (Bethesda),"Recent advances in long-read sequencing have enabled the creation of reference-quality genome assemblies for multiple individuals within a species. In particular, eight long-read genome assemblies have recently been published for the canine model (dogs and wolves). These assemblies were created using a range of sequencing and computational approaches, with only limited comparisons described among subsets of the assemblies. Here we present three high-quality de novo reference assemblies based upon Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing: two Bernese Mountain Dogs (BD & OD) and a Cairn terrier (CA611). These breeds are of particular interest due to the enrichment of unresolved genetic disorders. Leveraging advancement in software technologies, we utilized published data of Labrador Retriever (Yella) to generate a new assembly, resulting in a ∼280-fold increase in continuity (N50 size of 91 kbp vs 25.75 Mbp). In conjunction with these four new assemblies, we uniformly assessed eight existing assemblies for generalized quality metrics, sequence divergence, and a detailed BUSCO assessment. We identified a set of ∼400 conserved genes during the BUSCO analysis missing in all assemblies. Genome-wide methylation profiles were generated from the nanopore sequencing, resulting in broad concordance with existing whole-genome and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing, while highlighting superior overage of mobile elements. These analyses demonstrate the ability of Nanopore sequencing to resolve sequence and epigenetic profile of canine genomes.© The Author(s) 2023.

,37679776,Altered H3K4me3 profile at the TFAM promoter causes mitochondrial alterations in preadipocytes from first-degree relatives of type 2 diabetics.,Clin Epigenetics,"First-degree relatives of type 2 diabetics (FDR) exhibit a high risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D) and feature subcutaneous adipocyte hypertrophy, independent of obesity. In FDR, adipose cell abnormalities contribute to early insulin-resistance and are determined by adipocyte precursor cells (APCs) early senescence and impaired recruitment into the adipogenic pathway. Epigenetic mechanisms signal adipocyte differentiation, leading us to hypothesize that abnormal epigenetic modifications cause adipocyte dysfunction and enhance T2D risk. To test this hypothesis, we examined the genome-wide histone profile in APCs from the subcutaneous adipose tissue of healthy FDR.Sequencing-data analysis revealed 2644 regions differentially enriched in lysine 4 tri-methylated H3-histone (H3K4me3) in FDR compared to controls (CTRL) with significant enrichment in mitochondrial-related genes. These included TFAM, which regulates mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content and stability. In FDR APCs, a significant reduction in H3K4me3 abundance at the TFAM promoter was accompanied by a reduction in TFAM mRNA and protein levels. FDR APCs also exhibited reduced mtDNA content and mitochondrial-genome transcription. In parallel, FDR APCs exhibited impaired differentiation and TFAM induction during adipogenesis. In CTRL APCs, TFAM-siRNA reduced mtDNA content, mitochondrial transcription and adipocyte differentiation in parallel with upregulation of the CDKN1A and ZMAT3 senescence genes. Furthermore, TFAM-siRNA significantly expanded hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced senescence, while H2O2did not affect TFAM expression.Histone modifications regulate APCs ability to differentiate in mature cells, at least in part by modulating TFAM expression and affecting mitochondrial function. Reduced H3K4me3 enrichment at the TFAM promoter renders human APCs senescent and dysfunctional, increasing T2D risk.© 2023. BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature."
,37679740,"Integrated epigenome, whole genome sequence and metabolome analyses identify novel multi-omics pathways in type 2 diabetes: a Middle Eastern study.",BMC Med,"T2D is of high prevalence in the middle east and thus studying its mechanisms is of a significant importance. Using 1026 Qatar BioBank samples, epigenetics, whole genome sequencing and metabolomics were combined to further elucidate the biological mechanisms of T2D in a population with a high prevalence of T2D.An epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) with T2D was performed using the Infinium 850K EPIC array, followed by whole genome-wide sequencing SNP-CpG association analysis (> 5.5 million SNPs) and a methylome-metabolome (CpG-metabolite) analysis of the identified T2D sites.A total of 66 T2D-CpG associations were identified, including 63 novel sites in pathways of fructose and mannose metabolism, insulin signaling, galactose, starch and sucrose metabolism, and carbohydrate absorption and digestion. Whole genome SNP associations with the 66 CpGs resulted in 688 significant CpG-SNP associations comprising 22 unique CpGs (33% of the 66 CPGs) and included 181 novel pairs or pairs in novel loci. Fourteen of the loci overlapped published GWAS loci for diabetes related traits and were used to identify causal associations of HK1 and PFKFB2 with HbA1c. Methylome-metabolome analysis identified 66 significant CpG-metabolite pairs among which 61 pairs were novel. Using the identified methylome-metabolome associations, methylation QTLs, and metabolic networks, a multi-omics network was constructed which suggested a number of metabolic mechanisms underlying T2D methylated genes. 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-GPE (16:0/18:1) - a triglyceride-associated metabolite, shared a common network with 13 methylated CpGs, including TXNIP, PFKFB2, OCIAD1, and BLCAP. Mannonate - a food component/plant shared a common network with 6 methylated genes, including TXNIP, BLCAP, THBS4 and PEF1, pointing to a common possible cause of methylation in those genes. A subnetwork with alanine, glutamine, urea cycle (citrulline, arginine), and 1-carboxyethylvaline linked to PFKFB2 and TXNIP revealed associations with kidney function, hypertension and triglyceride metabolism. The pathway containing STYXL1-POR was associated with a sphingosine-ceramides subnetwork associated with HDL-C and LDL-C and point to steroid perturbations in T2D.This study revealed several novel methylated genes in T2D, with their genomic variants and associated metabolic pathways with several implications for future clinical use of multi-omics associations in disease and for studying therapeutic targets.© 2023.

Here we present blood DNA methylation data from 625 infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis in a 17-center prospective study, and associate them with disease severity. We investigate differentially methylated CpGs (DMCs) for disease severity. We characterize the DMCs based on their association with cell and tissues types, biological pathways, and gene expression. Lastly, we also examine the relationships of severity-related DMCs with respiratory and immune traits in independent cohorts. We identify 33 DMCs associated with severity. These DMCs are differentially methylated in blood immune cells. These DMCs are also significantly enriched in multiple tissues (e.g., lung) and cells (e.g., small airway epithelial cells), and biological pathways (e.g., interleukin-1-mediated signaling). Additionally, these DMCs are associated with respiratory and immune traits (e.g., asthma, lung function, IgE levels). Our study suggests the role of DNA methylation in bronchiolitis severity.© 2023.

,37674478,"Whole exome sequencing highlights rare variants in CTCF, DNMT1, DNMT3A, EZH2 and SUV39H1 as associated with FSHD.",Front Genet,"Introduction:Despite the progress made in the study of Facioscapulohumeral Dystrophy (FSHD), the wide heterogeneity of disease complicates its diagnosis and the genotype-phenotype correlation among patients and within families. In this context, the present work employed Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) to investigate known and unknown genetic contributors that may be involved in FSHD and may represent potential disease modifiers, even in presence of aD4Z4Reduced Allele (DRA).Methods:A cohort of 126 patients with clinical signs of FSHD were included in the study, which were characterized byD4Z4sizing, methylation analysis and WES. Specific protocols were employed forD4Z4sizing and methylation analysis, whereas the Illumina®Next-Seq 550 system was utilized for WES. The study included both patients with a DRA compatible with FSHD diagnosis and patients with longerD4Z4alleles. In case of patients harboring relevant variants from WES, the molecular analysis was extended to the family members.Results:The WES data analysis highlighted 20 relevant variants, among which 14 were located in known genetic modifiers (SMCHD1,DNMT3BandLRIF1) and 6 in candidate genes (CTCF,DNMT1,DNMT3A,EZH2andSUV39H1). Most of them were found together with a permissive short (4-7 RU) or borderline/long DRA (8-20 RU), supporting the possibility that different genes can contribute to disease heterogeneity in presence of a FSHD permissive background. The segregation and methylation analysis among family members, together with clinical findings, provided a more comprehensive picture of patients.Discussion:Our results support FSHD pathomechanism being complex with a multigenic contribution by several known (SMCHD1,DNMT3B,LRIF1) and possibly other candidate genes (CTCF,DNMT1,DNMT3A,EZH2,SUV39H1) to disease penetrance and expressivity. Our results further emphasize the importance of extending the analysis of molecular findings within the proband's family, with the purpose of providing a broader framework for understanding single cases and allowing finer genotype-phenotype correlations in FSHD-affected families.Copyright © 2023 Strafella, Caputo, Bortolani, Torchia, Megalizzi, Trastulli, Monforte, Colantoni, Caltagirone, Ricci, Tasca, Cascella and Giardina."
,37673891,Accelerated epigenetic aging and decreased natural killer cells based on DNA methylation in patients with untreated major depressive disorder.,NPJ Aging,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is known to cause significant disability. Genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles can be used to estimate biological aging and as epigenetic clocks. However, information on epigenetic clocks reported in MDD patients is inconsistent. Since antidepressants are likely confounders, we evaluated biological aging using various DNAm-based predictors in patients with MDD who had never received depression medication. A publicly available dataset consisting of whole blood samples from untreated MDD patients (n = 40) and controls (n = 40) was used. We analyzed five epigenetic clocks (HorvathAge, HannumAge, SkinBloodAge, PhenoAge, and GrimAge), DNAm-based telomere length (DNAmTL), and DNAm-based age-related plasma proteins (GrimAge components), as well as DNAm-based white blood cell composition. The results indicate that patients with untreated MDD were significantly associated with epigenetic aging acceleration in HannumAge and GrimAge. Furthermore, a decrease in natural killer cells, based on DNAm, was observed in patients with untreated MDD.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."
,37673571,Machine learning in the identification of prognostic DNA methylation biomarkers among patients with cancer: A systematic review of epigenome-wide studies.,Artif Intell Med,"DNA methylation biomarkers have great potential in improving prognostic classification systems for patients with cancer. Machine learning (ML)-based analytic techniques might help overcome the challenges of analyzing high-dimensional data in relatively small sample sizes. This systematic review summarizes the current use of ML-based methods in epigenome-wide studies for the identification of DNA methylation signatures associated with cancer prognosis.We searched three electronic databases including PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science for articles published until 2 January 2023. ML-based methods and workflows used to identify DNA methylation signatures associated with cancer prognosis were extracted and summarized. Two authors independently assessed the methodological quality of included studies by a seven-item checklist adapted from 'A Tool to Assess Risk of Bias and Applicability of Prediction Model Studies (PROBAST)' and from the 'Reporting Recommendations for Tumor Marker Prognostic Studies (REMARK). Different ML methods and workflows used in included studies were summarized and visualized by a sunburst chart, a bubble chart, and Sankey diagrams, respectively.Eighty-three studies were included in this review. Three major types of ML-based workflows were identified. 1) unsupervised clustering, 2) supervised feature selection, and 3) deep learning-based feature transformation. For the three workflows, the most frequently used ML techniques were consensus clustering, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and autoencoder, respectively. The systematic review revealed that the performance of these approaches has not been adequately evaluated yet and that methodological and reporting flaws were common in the identified studies using ML techniques.There is great heterogeneity in ML-based methodological strategies used by epigenome-wide studies to identify DNA methylation markers associated with cancer prognosis. In theory, most existing workflows could not handle the high multi-collinearity and potentially non-linearity interactions in epigenome-wide DNA methylation data. Benchmarking studies are needed to compare the relative performance of various approaches for specific cancer types. Adherence to relevant methodological and reporting guidelines are urgently needed.Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

The canonical mechanism of action associated with MX is its ability to intercalate DNA and inhibit topoisomerase II, giving it the designation of a topoisomerase II poison. Years after FDA approval, investigations have unveiled novel protein-binding partners, such as methyl-CpG-binding domain protein (MBD2), PIM1 serine/threonine kinase, RAD52, and others that may contribute to the therapeutic profile of MX. Moreover, recent proteomic studies have revealed MX's ability to modulate protein expression, illuminating the complex cellular interactions of MX. Although mechanistically relevant, the differential expression across the proteome does not address the direct interaction with potential binding partners. Identification and characterization of these MX-binding cellular partners will provide the molecular basis for the alternate mechanisms that influence MX's cytotoxicity. Here, we describe the design and synthesis of a MX-biotin probe (MXP) and negative control (MXP-NC) that can be used to define MX's cellular targets and expand our understanding of the proteome-wide profile for MX. In proof of concept studies, we used MXP to successfully isolate a recently identified protein-binding partner of MX, RAD52, in a cell lysate pulldown with streptavidin beads and western blotting.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

,37889307,Comprehensive evaluation of the implementation of episignatures for diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs).,Hum Genet,"Episignatures are popular tools for the diagnosis of rare neurodevelopmental disorders. They are commonly based on a set of differentially methylated CpGs used in combination with a support vector machine model. DNA methylation (DNAm) data often include missing values due to changes in data generation technology and batch effects. While many normalization methods exist for DNAm data, their impact on episignature performance have never been assessed. In addition, technologies to quantify DNAm evolve quickly and this may lead to poor transposition of existing episignatures generated on deprecated array versions to new ones. Indeed, probe removal between array versions, technologies or during preprocessing leads to missing values. Thus, the effect of missing data on episignature performance must also be carefully evaluated and addressed through imputation or an innovative approach to episignatures design. In this paper, we used data from patients suffering from Kabuki and Sotos syndrome to evaluate the influence of normalization methods, classification models and missing data on the prediction performances of two existing episignatures. We compare how six popular normalization methods for methylarray data affect episignature classification performances in Kabuki and Sotos syndromes and provide best practice suggestions when building new episignatures. In this setting, we show that Illumina, Noob or Funnorm normalization methods achieved higher classification performances on the testing sets compared to Quantile, Raw and Swan normalization methods. We further show that penalized logistic regression and support vector machines perform best in the classification of Kabuki and Sotos syndrome patients. Then, we describe a new paradigm to build episignatures based on the detection of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and evaluate their performance compared to classical differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs)-based episignatures in the presence of missing data. We show that the performance of classical DMC-based episignatures suffers from the presence of missing data more than the DMR-based approach. We present a comprehensive evaluation of how the normalization of DNA methylation data affects episignature performance, using three popular classification models. We further evaluate how missing data affect those models' predictions. Finally, we propose a novel methodology to develop episignatures based on differentially methylated regions identification and show how this method slightly outperforms classical episignatures in the presence of missing data.© 2023.

,37904203,DeepGAMI: deep biologically guided auxiliary learning for multimodal integration and imputation to improve genotype-phenotype prediction.,Genome Med,"Genotypes are strongly associated with disease phenotypes, particularly in brain disorders. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms behind this association remain elusive. With emerging multimodal data for these mechanisms, machine learning methods can be applied for phenotype prediction at different scales, but due to the black-box nature of machine learning, integrating these modalities and interpreting biological mechanisms can be challenging. Additionally, the partial availability of these multimodal data presents a challenge in developing these predictive models.To address these challenges, we developed DeepGAMI, an interpretable neural network model to improve genotype-phenotype prediction from multimodal data. DeepGAMI leverages functional genomic information, such as eQTLs and gene regulation, to guide neural network connections. Additionally, it includes an auxiliary learning layer for cross-modal imputation allowing the imputation of latent features of missing modalities and thus predicting phenotypes from a single modality. Finally, DeepGAMI uses integrated gradient to prioritize multimodal features for various phenotypes.We applied DeepGAMI to several multimodal datasets including genotype and bulk and cell-type gene expression data in brain diseases, and gene expression and electrophysiology data of mouse neuronal cells. Using cross-validation and independent validation, DeepGAMI outperformed existing methods for classifying disease types, and cellular and clinical phenotypes, even using single modalities (e.g., AUC score of 0.79 for Schizophrenia and 0.73 for cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease).We demonstrated that DeepGAMI improves phenotype prediction and prioritizes phenotypic features and networks in multiple multimodal datasets in complex brains and brain diseases. Also, it prioritized disease-associated variants, genes, and regulatory networks linked to different phenotypes, providing novel insights into the interpretation of gene regulatory mechanisms. DeepGAMI is open-source and available for general use.© 2023. The Author(s)."

We conducted a longitudinal study for 5 years, with cut-off points at 2 and 5 years, including 26 RRMS patients treated with GA for at least 6 months. A total of 6 miRNAs from a previous study (miR-9.5p, miR-126.3p, mir-138.5p, miR-146a.5p, miR-200c.3p, and miR-223.3p) were selected for this analysis. Clinical relapse, MRI activity, confirmed disability progression (CDP), alone or in combination (No Evidence of Disease Activity-3) (NEDA-3), and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), were studied. After multivariate regression analysis, miR-9.5p was associated with EDSS progression at 2 years (β = 0.23; 95% CI: 0.04-0.46;p= 0.047). Besides this, mean miR-138.5p values were lower in those patients with NEDA-3 at 2 years (p= 0.033), and miR-146a.5p and miR-126.3p were higher in patients with CDP progression at 2 years (p= 0.044 andp= 0.05 respectively.

,37696456,The complex biology of aryl hydrocarbon receptor activation in cancer and beyond.,Biochem Pharmacol,"The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) signaling pathway is a complex regulatory network that plays a critical role in various biological processes, including cellular metabolism, development, and immune responses. The complexity of AHR signaling arises from multiple factors, including the diverse ligands that activate the receptor, the expression level of AHR itself, and its interaction with the AHR nuclear translocator (ARNT). Additionally, the AHR crosstalks with the AHR repressor (AHRR) or other transcription factors and signaling pathways and it can also mediate non-genomic effects. Finally, posttranslational modifications of the AHR and its interaction partners, epigenetic regulation of AHR and its target genes, as well as AHR-mediated induction of enzymes that degrade AHR-activating ligands may contribute to the context-specificity of AHR activation. Understanding the complexity of AHR signaling is crucial for deciphering its physiological and pathological roles and developing therapeutic strategies targeting this pathway. Ongoing research continues to unravel the intricacies of AHR signaling, shedding light on the regulatory mechanisms controlling its diverse functions.Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier Inc."

,37848431,The admixed brushtail possum genome reveals invasion history in New Zealand and novel imprinted genes.,Nat Commun,"Combining genome assembly with population and functional genomics can provide valuable insights to development and evolution, as well as tools for species management. Here, we present a chromosome-level genome assembly of the common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula), a model marsupial threatened in parts of their native range in Australia, but also a major introduced pest in New Zealand. Functional genomics reveals post-natal activation of chemosensory and metabolic genes, reflecting unique adaptations to altricial birth and delayed weaning, a hallmark of marsupial development. Nuclear and mitochondrial analyses trace New Zealand possums to distinct Australian subspecies, which have subsequently hybridised. This admixture allowed phasing of parental alleles genome-wide, ultimately revealing at least four genes with imprinted, parent-specific expression not yet detected in other species (MLH1, EPM2AIP1, UBP1 and GPX7). We find that reprogramming of possum germline imprints, and the wider epigenome, is similar to eutherian mammals except onset occurs after birth. Together, this work is useful for genetic-based control and conservation of possums, and contributes to understanding of the evolution of novel mammalian epigenetic traits.© 2023.

The developmental origins of health and disease hypothesis proposes that early life conditions affect later-life health in a manner that is only partially modifiable by later-life experiences.To examine whether epigenetic measures of BMI developed in adults are valid biomarkers of childhood BMI and if they are sensitive to early life social determinants of health.This population-based study of over 3200 children and adolescents aged 8 to 18 years included data from 2 demographically diverse US pediatric cohort studies that combine longitudinal and twin study designs. Analyses were conducted from 2021 to 2022.Socioeconomic status, marginalized groups.Salivary epigenetic BMI, BMI. Analyses were conducted to validate the use of saliva epigenetic BMI as a potential biomarker of child BMI and to examine associations between epigenetic BMI and social determinants of health.Salivary epigenetic BMI was calculated from 2 cohorts: (1) 1183 individuals aged 8 to 18 years (609 female [51%]; mean age, 13.4 years) from the Texas Twin Project and (2) 2020 children (1011 female [50%]) measured at 9 years of age and 15 years of age from the Future of Families and Child Well-Being Study. Salivary epigenetic BMI was associated with children's BMI (r = 0.36; 95% CI, 0.31-0.40 to r = 0.50; 95% CI, 0.42-0.59). Longitudinal analysis found that epigenetic BMI was highly stable across adolescence but remained both a leading and lagging indicator of BMI change. Twin analyses showed that epigenetic BMI captured differences in BMI between monozygotic twins. Moreover, children from more disadvantaged socioeconomic status (b = -0.13 to -0.15 across samples) and marginalized racial and ethnic groups (b = 0.08-0.34 across samples) had higher epigenetic BMI, even when controlling for concurrent BMI, pubertal development, and tobacco exposure. Socioeconomic status at birth relative to concurrent socioeconomic status best predicted epigenetic BMI in childhood and adolescence (b = -0.15; 95% CI, -0.20 to -0.09).This study demonstrated that epigenetic measures of BMI calculated from pediatric saliva samples were valid biomarkers of childhood BMI and may be associated with early-life social inequalities. The findings are in line with the hypothesis that early-life conditions are especially important factors in epigenetic regulation of later-life health. Research showing that health later in life is linked to early-life conditions has important implications for the development of early-life interventions that could significantly extend healthy life span."
,37875652,NA,NA,"Young blood plasma is known to confer beneficial effects on various organs in mice and rats. However, it was not known whether plasma from young adult pigs rejuvenates old rat tissues at the epigenetic level; whether it alters the epigenetic clock, which is a highly accurate molecular biomarker of aging. To address this question, we developed and validated six different epigenetic clocks for rat tissues that are based on DNA methylation values derived from n = 613 tissue samples. As indicated by their respective names, the rat pan-tissue clock can be applied to DNA methylation profiles from all rat tissues, while the rat brain, liver, and blood clocks apply to the corresponding tissue types. We also developed two epigenetic clocks that apply to both human and rat tissues by adding n = 1366 human tissue samples to the training data. We employed these six rat clocks to investigate the rejuvenation effects of a porcine plasma fraction treatment in different rat tissues. The treatment more than halved the epigenetic ages of blood, heart, and liver tissue. A less pronounced, but statistically significant, rejuvenation effect could be observed in the hypothalamus. The treatment was accompanied by progressive improvement in the function of these organs as ascertained through numerous biochemical/physiological biomarkers, behavioral responses encompassing cognitive functions. An immunoglobulin G (IgG) N-glycosylation pattern shift from pro- to anti-inflammatory also indicated reversal of glycan aging. Overall, this study demonstrates that a young porcine plasma-derived treatment markedly reverses aging in rats according to epigenetic clocks, IgG glycans, and other biomarkers of aging.© 2023.

,37885906,Epigenetic age acceleration as a biomarker for impaired cognitive abilities in adulthood following early life adversity and psychiatric disorders.,Neurobiol Stress,"Early life adversity and psychiatric disorders are associated with earlier declines in neurocognitive abilities during adulthood. These declines may be preceded by changes in biological aging, specifically epigenetic age acceleration, providing an opportunity to uncover genome-wide biomarkers that identify individuals most likely to benefit from early screening and prevention.Five unique epigenetic age acceleration clocks derived from peripheral blood were examined in relation to latent variables of general and speeded cognitive abilities across two independent cohorts: 1) the Female Growth and Development Study (FGDS;n = 86), a 30-year prospective cohort study of substantiated child sexual abuse and non-abused controls, and 2) the Biological Classification of Mental Disorders study (BeCOME;n = 313), an adult community cohort established based on psychiatric disorders.A faster pace of biological aging (DunedinPoAm) was associated with lower general cognitive abilities in both cohorts and slower speeded abilities in the BeCOME cohort. Acceleration in the Horvath clock was significantly associated with slower speeded abilities in the BeCOME cohort but not the FGDS. Acceleration in the Hannum clock and the GrimAge clock were not significantly associated with either cognitive ability. Accelerated PhenoAge was associated with slower speeded abilities in the FGDS but not the BeCOME cohort.The present results suggest that epigenetic age acceleration has the potential to serve as a biomarker for neurocognitive decline in adults with a history of early life adversity or psychiatric disorders. Estimates of epigenetic aging may identify adults at risk of cognitive decline that could benefit from early neurocognitive screening.© 2023 The Authors."
,37884697,Biological age estimation using circulating blood biomarkers.,Commun Biol,"Biological age captures physiological deterioration better than chronological age and is amenable to interventions. Blood-based biomarkers have been identified as suitable candidates for biological age estimation. This study aims to improve biological age estimation using machine learning models and a feature-set of 60 circulating biomarkers available from the UK Biobank (n = 306,116). We implement an Elastic-Net derived Cox model with 25 selected biomarkers to predict mortality risk (C-Index = 0.778; 95% CI [0.767-0.788]), which outperforms the well-known blood-biomarker based PhenoAge model (C-Index = 0.750; 95% CI [0.739-0.761]), providing a C-Index lift of 0.028 representing an 11% relative increase in predictive value. Importantly, we then show that using common clinical assay panels, with few biomarkers, alongside imputation and the model derived on the full set of biomarkers, does not substantially degrade predictive accuracy from the theoretical maximum achievable for the available biomarkers. Biological age is estimated as the equivalent age within the same-sex population which corresponds to an individual's mortality risk. Values ranged between 20-years younger and 20-years older than individuals' chronological age, exposing the magnitude of ageing signals contained in blood markers.

Epigenetic age gap is the residual between epigenetic age measures and chronological age. Previous studies showed associations between epigenetic age gap and age-related outcomes including cognitive capacity and performance on some functional measures, but whether epigenetic age gap contributes to disparities in these outcomes is unknown. We use data from the Health and Retirement Study to examine the role of epigenetic age gap in racial disparities in cognitive and functional outcomes and consider the role of socioeconomic status (SES). Epigenetic age measures are GrimAge or Dunedin Pace of Aging methylation (DPoAm). Cognitive outcomes are cross-sectional score and two-year change in Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS). Functional outcomes are prevalence and incidence of limitations performing Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs). We find, relative to White participants, Black participants have lower scores and greater decline in TICS, higher prevalence and incidence rates of IADL limitations, and higher epigenetic age gap. Age- and gender-adjusted analyses reveal that higher GrimAge and DPoAm gap are both associated with worse cognitive and functional outcomes and mediate 6-11% of racial disparities in cognitive outcomes and 19-39% of disparities in functional outcomes. Adjusting for SES attenuates most DPoAm associations and most mediation effects. These results support that epigenetic age gap contributes to racial disparities in cognition and functioning and may be an important mechanism linking social factors to disparities in health outcomes."
,37853450,Accelerated DNA methylation age plays a role in the impact of cardiovascular risk factors on the human heart.,Clin Epigenetics,"DNA methylation (DNAm) age acceleration (AgeAccel) and cardiac age by 12-lead advanced electrocardiography (A-ECG) are promising biomarkers of biological and cardiac aging, respectively. We aimed to explore the relationships between DNAm age and A-ECG heart age and to understand the extent to which DNAm AgeAccel relates to cardiovascular (CV) risk factors in a British birth cohort from 1946.We studied four DNAm ages (AgeHannum, AgeHorvath, PhenoAge, and GrimAge) and their corresponding AgeAccel. Outcomes were the results from two publicly available ECG-based cardiac age scores: the Bayesian A-ECG-based heart age score of Lindow et al. 2022 and the deep neural network (DNN) ECG-based heart age score of Ribeiro et al. 2020. DNAm AgeAccel was also studied relative to results from two logistic regression-based A-ECG disease scores, one for left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction (LVSD), and one for LV electrical remodeling (LVER). Generalized linear models were used to explore the extent to which any associations between biological cardiometabolic risk factors (body mass index, hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, previous cardiovascular disease [CVD], and any CV risk factor) and the ECG-based outcomes are mediated by DNAm AgeAccel. We derived the total effects, average causal mediation effects (ACMEs), average direct effects (ADEs), and the proportion mediated [PM] with their 95% confidence intervals [CIs]. 498 participants (all 60-64 years) were included, with the youngest ECG heart age being 27 and the oldest 90. When exploring the associations between cardiometabolic risk factors and Bayesian A-ECG cardiac age, AgeAccelPheno appears to be a partial mediator, as ACME was 0.23 years [0.01, 0.52] p = 0.028 (i.e., PM≈18%) for diabetes, 0.34 [0.03, 0.74] p = 0.024 (i.e., PM≈15%) for high cholesterol, and 0.34 [0.03, 0.74] p = 0.024 (PM≈15%) for any CV risk factor. Similarly, AgeAccelGrim mediates ≈30% of the relationship between diabetes or high cholesterol and the DNN ECG-based heart age. When exploring the link between cardiometabolic risk factors and the A-ECG-based LVSD and LVER scores, it appears that AgeAccelPheno or AgeAccelGrim mediate 10-40% of these associations.By the age of 60, participants with accelerated DNA methylation appear to have older, weaker, and more electrically impaired hearts. We show that the harmful effects of CV risk factors on cardiac age and health, appear to be partially mediated by DNAm AgeAccelPheno and AgeAccelGrim. This highlights the need to further investigate the potential cardioprotective effects of selective DNA methyltransferases modulators.© 2023. BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature."
,37848731,Psychosocial moderators of polygenic risk scores of inflammatory biomarkers in relation to GrimAge.,Neuropsychopharmacology,"GrimAge acceleration has previously predicted age-related morbidities and mortality. In the current study, we sought to examine how GrimAge is associated with genetic predisposition for systemic inflammation and whether psychosocial factors moderate this association. Military veterans from the National Health and Resilience in Veterans study, which surveyed a nationally representative sample of European American male veterans, provided saliva samples for genotyping (N = 1135). We derived polygenic risk scores (PRS) from the UK Biobank as markers of genetic predisposition to inflammation. Results revealed that PRS for three inflammatory PRS markers-HDL (lower), apolipoprotein B (lower), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (higher)-were associated with accelerated GrimAge. Additionally, these PRS interacted with a range of potentially modifiable psychosocial variables, such as exercise and gratitude, previously identified as associated with accelerated GrimAge. Using gene enrichment, we identified anti-inflammatory and antihistamine drugs that perturbate pathways of genes highly represented in the inflammatory PRS, laying the groundwork for future work to evaluate the potential of these drugs in mitigating epigenetic aging.© 2023.

,37821974,"Accelerated epigenetic age, inflammation, and gene expression in lung: comparisons of smokers and vapers with non-smokers.",Clin Epigenetics,"Cigarette smoking and aging are the main risk factors for pulmonary diseases, including cancer. Epigenetic aging may explain the relationship between smoking, electronic cigarette vaping, and pulmonary health. No study has examined smoking and vaping-related epigenetic aging in relation to lung biomarkers.Lung epigenetic aging measured by DNA methylation (mAge) and its acceleration (mAA) was assessed in young (age 21-30) electronic cigarette vapers (EC, n = 14, including 3 never-smoking EC), smokers (SM, n = 16), and non-EC/non-SM (NS, n = 39). We investigated relationships of mAge estimates with chronological age (Horvath-mAge), lifespan/mortality (Grim-mAge), telomere length (TL-mAge), smoking/EC history, urinary biomarkers, lung cytokines, and transcriptome.Compared to NS, EC and SM had significantly older Grim-mAge, shorter TL-mAge, significantly accelerated Grim-mAge and decelerated TL-mAge. Among SM, Grim-mAA was associated with nicotine intake and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL). For EC, Horvath-mAA was significantly correlated with puffs per day. Overall, cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8) and 759 transcripts (651 unique genes) were significantly associated with Grim-mAA. Grim-mAA-associated genes were highly enriched in immune-related pathways and genes that play a role in the morphology and structures of cells/tissues.Faster lung mAge for SM is consistent with prior studies of blood. Faster lung mAge for EC compared to NS indicates possible adverse pulmonary effects of EC on biological aging. Our findings support further research, particularly on epigenetic markers, on effects of smoking and vaping on pulmonary health. Given that most EC are former smokers, further study is needed to understand unique effects of electronic cigarettes on biological aging.© 2023. BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature."

Histopathological whole slide images provide a wealth of pathologic data on the cellular level that can be leveraged to build deep learning models to assess age acceleration. Here, we used a collection of digitized human post-mortem hippocampal sections to develop a histological brain age estimation model. Our model predicted brain age within a mean absolute error of 5.45 ± 0.22 years, with attention weights corresponding to neuroanatomical regions vulnerable to age-related changes. We found that histopathologic brain age acceleration had significant associations with clinical and pathologic outcomes that were not found with epigenetic based measures. Our results indicate that histopathologic brain age is a powerful, independent metric for understanding factors that contribute to brain aging.© 2023. The Author(s)."
,37787856,Application of a mathematical model to clarify the statistical characteristics of a pan-tissue DNA methylation clock.,Geroscience,"DNA methylation clocks estimate biological age based on DNA methylation profiles. This study developed a mathematical model to describe DNA methylation aging and the establishment of a pan-tissue DNA methylation clock. The model simulates the aging dynamics of DNA methylation profiles based on passive demethylation as well as the process of cross-sectional bulk data acquisition. As a result, this study identified two conditions under which the pan-tissue DNA methylation clock can successfully predict biological age: one condition is that the target tissues are sufficiently well represented in the training dataset, and the other condition is that the target sample contains cell subsets that are common among different tissues. When either of these conditions is met, the clock performs well. It is also suggested that the epigenetic age of all samples in the target tissue tends to be either over or underestimated when biological age prediction fails. The model can reveal the statistical characteristics of DNA methylation clocks.© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to American Aging Association."
,37786333,Intersection clock reveals a rejuvenation event during human embryogenesis.,Aging Cell,"Recent research revealed a rejuvenation event during early development of mice. Here, by examining epigenetic age dynamics of human embryogenesis, we tested whether a similar event exists in humans. For this purpose, we developed an epigenetic clock method, the intersection clock, that utilizes bisulfite sequencing in a way that maximizes the use of informative CpG sites with no missing clock CpG sites in test samples and applied it to human embryo development data. We observed no changes in the predicted epigenetic age between cleavage stage and blastocyst stage embryos; however, a significant decrease was observed between blastocysts and cells representing the epiblast. Additionally, by applying the intersection clock to datasets spanning pre and postimplantation, we found no significant change in the epigenetic age during preimplantation stages; however, the epigenetic age of postimplantation samples was lower compared to the preimplantation stages. We further investigated the epigenetic age of primed (representing early postimplantation) and naïve (representing preimplantation) pluripotent stem cells and observed that in all cases the epigenetic age of primed cells was significantly lower than that of naïve cells. Together, our data suggest that human embryos are rejuvenated during early embryogenesis. Hence, the rejuvenation event is conserved between the mouse and human, and it occurs around the gastrulation stage in both species. Beyond this advance, the intersection clock opens the way for other epigenetic age studies based on human bisulfite sequencing datasets as opposed to methylation arrays.© 2023 The Authors.

,37761864,A Review of the Epigenetic Clock: Emerging Biomarkers for Asthma and Allergic Disease.,Genes (Basel),"DNA methylation (DNAm) is a dynamic, age-dependent epigenetic modification that can be used to study interactions between genetic and environmental factors. Environmental exposures during critical periods of growth and development may alter DNAm patterns, leading to increased susceptibility to diseases such as asthma and allergies. One method to study the role of DNAm is the epigenetic clock-an algorithm that uses DNAm levels at select age-informative Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine (CpG) dinucleotides to predict epigenetic age (EA). The difference between EA and calendar age (CA) is termed epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) and reveals information about the biological capacity of an individual. Associations between EAA and disease susceptibility have been demonstrated for a variety of age-related conditions and, more recently, phenotypes such as asthma and allergic diseases, which often begin in childhood and progress throughout the lifespan. In this review, we explore different epigenetic clocks and how they have been applied, particularly as related to childhood asthma. We delve into how in utero and early life exposures (e.g., smoking, air pollution, maternal BMI) result in methylation changes. Furthermore, we explore the potential for EAA to be used as a biomarker for asthma and allergic diseases and identify areas for further study."
,37759519,New Possibilities for Evaluating the Development of Age-Related Pathologies Using the Dynamical Network Biomarkers Theory.,Cells,"Aging is the slowest process in a living organism. During this process, mortality rate increases exponentially due to the accumulation of damage at the cellular level. Cellular senescence is a well-established hallmark of aging, as well as a promising target for preventing aging and age-related diseases. However, mapping the senescent cells in tissues is extremely challenging, as their low abundance, lack of specific markers, and variability arise from heterogeneity. Hence, methodologies for identifying or predicting the development of senescent cells are necessary for achieving healthy aging. A new wave of bioinformatic methodologies based on mathematics/physics theories have been proposed to be applied to aging biology, which is altering the way we approach our understand of aging. Here, we discuss the dynamical network biomarkers (DNB) theory, which allows for the prediction of state transition in complex systems such as living organisms, as well as usage of Raman spectroscopy that offers a non-invasive and label-free imaging, and provide a perspective on potential applications for the study of aging."
,37751697,Accurate age prediction from blood using a small set of DNA methylation sites and a cohort-based machine learning algorithm.,Cell Rep Methods,"Chronological age prediction from DNA methylation sheds light on human aging, health, and lifespan. Current clocks are mostly based on linear models and rely upon hundreds of sites across the genome. Here, we present GP-age, an epigenetic non-linear cohort-based clock for blood, based upon 11,910 methylomes. Using 30 CpG sites alone, GP-age outperforms state-of-the-art models, with a median accuracy of ∼2 years on held-out blood samples, for both array and sequencing-based data. We show that aging-related changes occur at multiple neighboring CpGs, with implications for using fragment-level analysis of sequencing data in aging research. By training three independent clocks, we show enrichment of donors with consistent deviation between predicted and actual age, suggesting individual rates of biological aging. Overall, we provide a compact yet accurate alternative to array-based clocks for blood, with applications in longitudinal aging research, forensic profiling, and monitoring epigenetic processes in transplantation medicine and cancer.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

However, sex differences in biological aging have not been consistently reported and may differ depending on the measure used. This study aimed to determine the correlations between epigenetic age acceleration (AA), and other markers of biological aging, separately in males and females. We additionally explored the extent to which these AA measures differed according to socioeconomic characteristics, clinical markers, and diseases. Epigenetic clocks (HorvathAge, HannumAge, PhenoAge, GrimAge, GrimAge2, and DunedinPACE) were estimated in blood from 560 relatively healthy Australians aged ≥ 70 years (females, 50.7%) enrolled in the ASPREE study. A system-wide deficit accumulation frailty index (FI) composed of 67 health-related measures was generated. Brain age and subsequently brain-predicted age difference (brain-PAD) were estimated from neuroimaging. Females had significantly reduced AA than males, but higher FI, and there was no difference in brain-PAD. FI had the strongest correlation with DunedinPACE (range r: 0.21 to 0.24 in both sexes). Brain-PAD was not correlated with any biological aging measures. Significant correlations between AA and sociodemographic characteristics and health markers were more commonly found in females (e.g., for DunedinPACE and systolic blood pressure r = 0.2, p < 0.001) than in males. GrimAA and Grim2AA were significantly associated with obesity and depression in females, while in males, hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease were associated with these clocks, as well as DunedinPACE. Our findings highlight the importance of considering sex differences when investigating the link between biological age and clinical measures.© 2023. The Author(s)."

However, the underlying pathogenesis of lung cancer caused by senescence is not clear. In this study, we try to explain the potential pathogenesis between senescence and lung cancer through proteomics and metabonomics. And try to find new potential therapeutic targets in lung cancer patients through network mendelian randomization (MR).The genome-wide association data of this study was mainly obtained from a meta-analysis and the Transdisciplinary Research in Cancer of the Lung Consortium (TRICL), respectively.And in this study, we mainly used genetic complementarity methods to explore the susceptibility of aging to lung cancer. Additionally, a mediation analysis was performed to explore the potential mediating role of proteomics and metabonomics, using a network MR design.GNOVA analysis revealed a shared genetic structure between HannumAge and lung cancer with a significant genetic correlation estimated at 0.141 and 0.135, respectively. MR analysis showed a relationship between HannumAge and lung cancer, regardless of smoking status. Furthermore, genetically predicted HannumAge was consistently associated with the proteins C-type lectin domain family 4 member D (CLEC4D) and Retinoic acid receptor responder protein 1 (RARR-1), indicating their potential role as mediators in the causal pathway.HannumAge acceleration may increase the risk of lung cancer, some of which may be mediated by CLEC4D and RARR-1, suggestion that CLEC4D and RARR-1 may serve as potential drug targets for the treatment of lung cancer.Copyright © 2023 Fang, Liu, Zhao, Li, He and Liu."
,37743489,NA,NA,"Epigenetic age is an estimator of biological age based on DNA methylation; its discrepancy from chronologic age warrants further investigation. We recently reported that greater polyphenol intake benefitted ectopic fats, brain function, and gut microbiota profile, corresponding with elevated urine polyphenols. The effect of polyphenol-rich dietary interventions on biological aging is yet to be determined.We calculated different biological aging epigenetic clocks of different generations (Horvath2013, Hannum2013, Li2018, Horvath skin and blood2018, PhenoAge2018, PCGrimAge2022), their corresponding age and intrinsic age accelerations, and DunedinPACE, all based on DNA methylation (Illumina EPIC array; pre-specified secondary outcome) for 256 participants with abdominal obesity or dyslipidemia, before and after the 18-month DIRECT PLUS randomized controlled trial. Three interventions were assigned: healthy dietary guidelines, a Mediterranean (MED) diet, and a polyphenol-rich, low-red/processed meat Green-MED diet. Both MED groups consumed 28 g walnuts/day (+ 440 mg/day polyphenols). The Green-MED group consumed green tea (3-4 cups/day) and Mankai (Wolffia globosa strain) 500-ml green shake (+ 800 mg/day polyphenols). Adherence to the Green-MED diet was assessed by questionnaire and urine polyphenols metabolomics (high-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight).Baseline chronological age (51.3 ± 10.6 years) was significantly correlated with all methylation age (mAge) clocks with correlations ranging from 0.83 to 0.95; p < 2.2e - 16 for all. While all interventions did not differ in terms of changes between mAge clocks, greater Green-Med diet adherence was associated with a lower 18-month relative change (i.e., greater mAge attenuation) in Li and Hannum mAge (beta =  - 0.41, p = 0.004 and beta =  - 0.38, p = 0.03, respectively; multivariate models). Greater Li mAge attenuation (multivariate models adjusted for age, sex, baseline mAge, and weight loss) was mostly affected by higher intake of Mankai (beta =  - 1.8; p = 0.061) and green tea (beta =  - 1.57; p = 0.0016) and corresponded with elevated urine polyphenols: hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, and urolithin C (p < 0.05 for all) and urolithin A (p = 0.08), highly common in green plants. Overall, participants undergoing either MED-style diet had ~ 8.9 months favorable difference between the observed and expected Li mAge at the end of the intervention (p = 0.02).This study showed that MED and green-MED diets with increased polyphenols intake, such as green tea and Mankai, are inversely associated with biological aging. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first clinical trial to indicate a potential link between polyphenol intake, urine polyphenols, and biological aging.ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03020186.© 2023.

Multilevel, multivariable Cox regression models were used to examine whether optimism and negative affect moderated the associations of two measures of neighborhood characteristics (the national Area Deprivation Index (ADI) and perceived neighborhood problems) on incident hospitalized HF.Optimism moderated the association of the ADI with incident HF. Compared to participants reporting the lowest tertile of optimism, those in the highest tertile of optimism had a 29% lower rate of HF associated with increasing ADI in fully adjusted models. We found no evidence for a moderating effect of negative affect.This study supports optimism as a source of resilience to the detrimental effects of neighborhood disadvantage on HF risk. Population-level strategies to promote sociocultural antecedents to optimism may serve as a viable method of reducing the disproportionate burden of HF among NH Black persons.© 2023 The Authors."

A novel epigenetic measure of biological aging, DunedinPACE, is associated with cognitive dysfunction, incident dementia, and mortality. Here, we tested for associations between DunedinPACE and structural MRI phenotypes in three datasets spanning midlife to advanced age: the Dunedin Study (age=45 years), the Framingham Heart Study Offspring Cohort (mean age=63 years), and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (mean age=75 years). We also tested four additional epigenetic measures of aging: the Horvath clock, the Hannum clock, PhenoAge, and GrimAge. Across all datasets (total N observations=3,380; total N individuals=2,322), faster DunedinPACE was associated with lower total brain volume, lower hippocampal volume, and thinner cortex. In two datasets, faster DunedinPACE was associated with greater burden of white matter hyperintensities. Across all measures, DunedinPACE and GrimAge had the strongest and most consistent associations with brain phenotypes. Our findings suggest that single timepoint measures of multi-organ decline such as DunedinPACE could be useful for gauging nervous system health."
,37732184,Development and Characterization of Proteomic Aging Clocks in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study.,medRxiv,"Biological age may be estimated by proteomic aging clocks (PACs). Previous published PACs were constructed either in smaller studies or mainly in White individuals, and they used proteomic measures from only one-time point. In the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study of about 12,000 persons followed for 30 years (around 75% White, 25% Black), we created de novo PACs and compared their performance to published PACs at two different time points. We measured 4,712 plasma proteins by SomaScan in 11,761 midlife participants, aged 46-70 years (1990-92), and 5,183 late-life pariticpants, aged 66-90 years (2011-13). All proteins were log2-transformed to correct for skewness. We created de novo PACs by training them against chronological age using elastic net regression in two-thirds of healthy participants in midlife and late life and compared their performance to three published PACs. We estimated age acceleration (by regressing each PAC on chronological age) and its change from midlife to late life. We examined their associations with mortality from all-cause, cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, and lower respiratory disease (LRD) using Cox proportional hazards regression in all remaining participants irrespective of health. The model was adjusted for chronological age, smoking, body mass index (BMI), and other confounders. The ARIC PACs had a slightly stronger correlation with chronological age than published PACs in healthy participants at each time point. Associations with mortality were similar for the ARIC and published PACs. For late-life and midlife age acceleration for the ARIC PACs, respectively, hazard ratios (HRs) per one standard deviation were 1.65 and 1.38 (both p<0.001) for all-cause mortality, 1.37 and 1.20 (both p<0.001) for CVD mortality, 1.21 (p=0.03) and 1.04 (p=0.19) for cancer mortality, and 1.46 and 1.68 (both p<0.001) for LRD mortality. For the change in age acceleration, HRs for all-cause, CVD, and LRD mortality were comparable to those observed for late-life age acceleration. The association between the change in age acceleration and cancer mortality was insignificant. In this prospective study, the ARIC and published PACs were similarly associated with an increased risk of mortality and advanced testing in relation to various age-related conditions in future studies is suggested."

This study tests whether supportive and consistent parenting buffers associations between neighborhood disadvantage in early adolescence and epigenetic aging in adulthood. A community sample from Birmingham, Alabama, USA (N = 343; 57% female; 81% Black, 19% White) was assessed in early adolescence (T1; ages 11 and 13) and adulthood (T2; age 27). At T1, neighborhood poverty was derived from census data and neighborhood disorder was reported by caregivers. Both youth and parents reported on parental discipline and nurturance. At T2, methylation of salivary DNA was used to derive a mortality risk index and Hannum, Horvath, PhenoAge, and GrimAge epigenetic age estimators. Regression analyses revealed that neighborhood disadvantage was associated with accelerated epigenetic aging and/or mortality risk only when combined with high levels of harsh and inconsistent discipline and low child-reported parental nurturance. These findings identify epigenetic aging and mortality risk as relevant mechanisms through which neighborhood adversity experienced in adolescence may affect later health; they also point to the importance of supportive and consistent parenting for reducing the biological embedding of neighborhood adversity in early adolescence.© 2023.

,37702598,"Fail-tests of DNA methylation clocks, and development of a noise barometer for measuring epigenetic pressure of aging and disease.",Aging (Albany NY),"This study shows that Elastic Net (EN) DNA methylation (DNAme) clocks have low accuracy of predictions for individuals of the same age and a low resolution between healthy and disease cohorts; caveats inherent in applying linear model to non-linear processes. We found that change in methylation of cytosines with age is, interestingly, not the determinant for their selection into the clocks. Moreover, an EN clock's selected cytosines change when non-clock cytosines are removed from the training data; as expected from optimization in a machine learning (ML) context, but inconsistently with the identification of health markers in a biological context. To address these limitations, we moved from predictions to measurement of biological age, focusing on the cytosines that on average remain invariable in their methylation through lifespan, postulated to be homeostatically vital. We established that dysregulation of such cytosines, measured as the sums of standard deviations of their methylation values, quantifies biological noise, which in our hypothesis is a biomarker of aging and disease. We term this approach a ""noise barometer"" - the pressure of aging and disease on an organism. These noise-detecting cytosines are particularly important as sums of SD on the entire 450K DNAme array data yield a random pattern through chronology. Testing how many cytosines of the 450K arrays become noisier with age, we found that the paradigm of DNAme noise as a biomarker of aging and disease remarkably manifests in ~1/4 of the total. In that large set even the cytosines that have on average constant methylation through age show increased SDs and can be used as noise detectors of the barometer."

,37693450,NA,NA,"Self-control is a personality dimension that is associated with better physical health and a longer lifespan. Here we examined (1) whether self-control is associated with buccal and saliva DNA-methylation (DNAm) measures of biological aging quantified in children, adolescents, and adults, and (2) whether biological aging measured in buccal DNAm is associated with self-reported health. Following preregistered analyses, we computed two DNAm measures of advanced biological age (PhenoAge and GrimAge Acceleration) and a DNAm measure of pace of aging (DunedinPACE) in buccal samples from the German Socioeconomic Panel Study (SOEP-G[ene],n= 1058, age range 0-72,Mage= 42.65) and saliva samples from the Texas Twin Project (TTP,n= 1327, age range 8-20,Mage= 13.50). We found that lower self-control was associated with advanced biological age in older adults (β=-.34), but not young adults, adolescents or children. This association was not accounted for by statistical correction for socioeconomic contexts, BMI, or genetic correlates of low self-control. Moreover, a faster pace of aging and advanced biological age measured in buccal DNAm were associated with worse self-reported health (β=.13 toβ= .19). But, effect sizes were weaker than observations in blood, thus customization of DNAm aging measures to buccal and saliva tissues may be necessary. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that self-control is associated with health via pathways that accelerate biological aging in older adults."
,37691946,Small immunological clocks identified by deep learning and gradient boosting.,Front Immunol,"The aging process affects all systems of the human body, and the observed increase in inflammatory components affecting the immune system in old age can lead to the development of age-associated diseases and systemic inflammation.We propose a small clock model SImAge based on a limited number of immunological biomarkers. To regress the chronological age from cytokine data, we first use a baseline Elastic Net model, gradient-boosted decision trees models, and several deep neural network architectures. For the full dataset of 46 immunological parameters, DANet, SAINT, FT-Transformer and TabNet models showed the best results for the test dataset. Dimensionality reduction of these models with SHAP values revealed the 10 most age-associated immunological parameters, taken to construct the SImAge small immunological clock. The best result of the SImAge model shown by the FT-Transformer deep neural network model has mean absolute error of 6.94 years and Pearsonρ= 0.939 on the independent test dataset. Explainable artificial intelligence methods allow for explaining the model solution for each individual participant.We developed an approach to construct a model of immunological age based on just 10 immunological parameters, coined SImAge, for which the FT-Transformer deep neural network model had proved to be the best choice. The model shows competitive results compared to the published studies on immunological profiles, and takes a smaller number of features as an input. Neural network architectures outperformed gradient-boosted decision trees, and can be recommended in the further analysis of immunological profiles.Copyright © 2023 Kalyakulina, Yusipov, Kondakova, Bacalini, Franceschi, Vedunova and Ivanchenko."
,37691384,Pleiotropic influence of DNA methylation QTLs on physiological and ageing traits.,Epigenetics,"DNA methylation is influenced by genetic and non-genetic factors. Here, we chart quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that modulate levels of methylation at highly conserved CpGs using liver methylome data from mouse strains belonging to the BXD family. A regulatory hotspot on chromosome 5 had the highest density of trans-acting methylation QTLs (trans-meQTLs) associated with multiple distant CpGs. We refer to this locus as meQTL.5a. Trans-modulated CpGs showed age-dependent changes and were enriched in developmental genes, including several members of the MODY pathway (maturity onset diabetes of the young). The joint modulation by genotype and ageing resulted in a more 'aged methylome' for BXD strains that inherited the DBA/2J parental allele at meQTL.5a. Further, several gene expression traits, body weight, and lipid levels mapped to meQTL.5a, and there was a modest linkage with lifespan. DNA binding motif and protein-protein interaction enrichment analyses identified the hepatic nuclear factor,Hnf1a(MODY3 gene in humans), as a strong candidate. The pleiotropic effects of meQTL.5a could contribute to variations in body size and metabolic traits, and influence CpG methylation and epigenetic ageing that could have an impact on lifespan."

No associations were observed for other DSM-oriented subscales.Conclusions:The meta-analysis results suggest that epigenetic gestational age acceleration is not associated with child emotional and behavioural functioning for preschool age group. These findings may relate to our study population, which includes two cohorts enriched for ASD and one preterm birth cohort.; future work should address the role of epigenetic age in child health in other study populations.Abbreviations:DNAm: DNA methylation; CBCL: Child Behavioral Checklist; ECHO: Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes; EARLI: Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation; MARBLES: Markers of Autism Risk in Babies - Learning Early Signs; ELGAN: Extremely Low Gestational Age Newborns; ASD: autism spectrum disorder; BMI: body mass index; DSM: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders."

A recent study by Poganik and colleagues showed that severe stress in mice and humans transiently elevates biological age of several tissues, and this transient age increase is reversible when the stress is removed. These studies suggest new strategies for reversing normal aging. However, it is important to note that developmental origin of health and disease studies have shown that developmental exposure to toxic chemicals such as lead causes permanent changes in neuron shape, connectivity and cellular hyperplasia of organs such as the heart and liver. In this review, the PEER hypothesis speculates that the hallmarks of aging and the hallmarks of developmental origin of health and disease intersect at PEERs."

Moreover, obesity is an increasingly concerning public health issue across the world and its prevalence is rising amongst women of reproductive age. The fertility of over-weight and obese women is reduced and they experience a higher rate of miscarriage. In pregnant women obesity not only increases the risk of antenatal complications, such as preeclampsia and gestational diabetes, but also fetal abnormalities, and consequently the overall feto-maternal mortality. Ultrasound is one of the most valuable methods to predict and evaluate pregnancy complications. However, in overweight and obese pregnant women, the ultrasound examination is met with several challenges, mainly due to an impaired acoustic window. Overall obesity in pregnancy poses special challenges and constraints to the antenatal care and increases the rate of pregnancy complications, as well as complications later in life for the mother and child.© 2023.

The study of epigenetic factors that affect gene expression, such as DNA methylation, has become an important area of research in ASD. In recent years, there has been an increasing body of evidence pointing to epigenetic mechanisms that influence brain development, as in the case of ASD, when gene methylation dysregulation is present. Our analysis revealed 853 differentially methylated CpG in ASD patients, affecting 509 genes across the genome. Enrichment analysis showed five related diseases, including autistic disorder and mental disorders, which are particularly significant. In this work, we identified 64 genes that were previously reported in the SFARI gene database, classified according to their impact index. Additionally, we identified new genes that have not been previously reported as candidates with differences in the methylation patterns of Mexican children with ASD."

Identification of patients likely to recur using noninvasive approaches could inform treatment strategy, whether intervention or monitoring. In this study, we analyze the DNA methylation levels in blood (serum and plasma) and tissue samples from 155 meningioma patients, compared to other central nervous system tumor and non-tumor entities. We discover DNA methylation markers unique to meningiomas and use artificial intelligence to create accurate and universal models for identifying and predicting meningioma recurrence, using either blood or tissue samples. Here we show that liquid biopsy is a potential noninvasive and reliable tool for diagnosing and predicting outcomes in meningioma patients. This approach can improve personalized management strategies for these patients.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."

An Updated Review on Genetic Peripheral Markers.,Int J Mol Sci,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia that affects millions of individuals worldwide. Although the research over the last decades has provided new insight into AD pathophysiology, there is currently no cure for the disease. AD is often only diagnosed once the symptoms have become prominent, particularly in the late-onset (sporadic) form of AD. Consequently, it is essential to further new avenues for early diagnosis. With recent advances in genomic analysis and a lower cost of use, the exploration of genetic markers alongside RNA molecules can offer a key avenue for early diagnosis. We have here provided a brief overview of potential genetic markers differentially expressed in peripheral tissues in AD cases compared to controls, as well as considering the changes to the dynamics of RNA molecules. By integrating both genotype and RNA changes reported in AD, biomarker profiling can be key for developing reliable AD diagnostic tools."

Here, we summarize latest advancements in CRISPR/Cas genome editing of fruit crops, including efforts to decipher the mechanisms behind plant development and plant immunity, We also highlight the potential challenges and improvements in the application of genome editing tools to fruit crops, including optimizing the expression of CRISPR/Cas cassette, improving the delivery efficiency of CRISPR/Cas reagents, increasing the specificity of genome editing, and optimizing the transformation and regeneration system. In addition, we propose the perspectives on the application of genome editing in crop breeding especially in fruit crops and highlight the potential challenges. It is worth noting that efforts to manipulate fruit crops with genome editing systems are urgently needed for fruit crops breeding and demonstration.© 2023. The Author(s)."
,37789398,Warming-induced changes of broccoli head to cauliflower-like curd in Brassica oleracea are regulated by DNA methylation as revealed by methylome and transcriptome co-profiling.,Mol Hortic,"Increasingly warming temperature impacts on all aspects of growth and development in plants. Flower development is a complex process that is very sensitive to ambient temperature, and warming temperatures often lead to abnormal flower development and remarkably reduce the quality and yield of inflorescent vegetables and many other crops, which can be exemplified by Brassica oleracea cv. Green Harmony F1, a broccoli cultivar, whose floral development is ceased at inflorescence meristem (at 28 °C) or floral primordium stage (at 22 °C), forming a cauliflower-like curd (28 °C) or intermediate curd (22 °C) instead of normal broccoli head at 16 °C. However, the underlying molecular regulatory mechanisms are not well understood. Here we report that warming temperature (28 °C or 22 °C) induced hypermethylation of the genome, especially the promoter regions of such sets of genes as ribosome biogenesis-related and others, leading to the suppression of the apex-highly-expressed distinctive genes, subsequently resulting in the abnormal floral development, as revealed by methylome and transcriptome co-profiling. The regulation of warming-induced abnormal floral development in broccoli was further verified by the fact that the DNA methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine (5-azaC) released the expression of genes from the warming temperature-induced suppression, and restored the broccoli development to normalcy at warming temperature. The research provided new approaches to breeding broccoli and other crops for growing in wider or warmer temperature zones. Graphical Abstract.© 2022. The Author(s)."
,37840147,Methylomics and cancer: the current state of methylation profiling and marker development for clinical care.,Cancer Cell Int,"Epigenetic modifications have long been recognized as an essential level in transcriptional regulation linking behavior and environmental conditions or stimuli with biological processes and disease development. Among them, methylation is the most abundant of these reversible epigenetic marks, predominantly occurring on DNA, RNA, and histones. Methylation modification is intimately involved in regulating gene transcription and cell differentiation, while aberrant methylation status has been linked with cancer development in several malignancies. Early detection and precise restoration of dysregulated methylation form the basis for several epigenetics-based therapeutic strategies. In this review, we summarize the current basic understanding of the regulation and mechanisms responsible for methylation modification and cover several cutting-edge research techniques for detecting methylation across the genome and transcriptome. We then explore recent advances in clinical diagnostic applications of methylation markers of various cancers and address the current state and future prospects of methylation modifications in therapies for different diseases, especially comparing pharmacological methylase/demethylase inhibitors with the CRISPRoff/on methylation editing systems. This review thus provides a resource for understanding the emerging role of epigenetic methylation in cancer, the use of methylation-based biomarkers in cancer detection, and novel methylation-targeted drugs.© 2023.

,37893796,Relationship between Composite Dietary Antioxidant Index and Aging.,Healthcare (Basel),"Numerous studies have demonstrated a close relationship between antioxidant-rich diets and comorbidities as well as mortality. However, the relationship between such diets and aging remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between the Composite Dietary Antioxidant Index (CDAI) and aging.All participants were from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2001-2010. Phenotypic age was calculated using a formula and subtracted from the chronological age to determine the aging. When the phenotypic age exceeded the chronological age, it was considered as aging. A weighted logistic regression model was employed to explore the relationship between CDAI and aging. Restricted cubic splines (RCSs) were used to examine the potential nonlinear relationship between them. Subgroup analysis and joint analysis were conducted to explore the effect of modifiers in these relationships.A total of 19,212 participants (weighted: 165,285,442 individuals) were included in this study. The weighted logistic regression model showed a significant correlation between CDAI and the risk of aging (OR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.84-0.96). RCS analysis revealed an L-shaped dose-response relationship between CDAI and the risk of aging. Subgroup analysis indicated that the association between CDAI and aging was more pronounced in middle-aged individuals and non-smokers. The joint analysis demonstrated that although smoking accelerated aging among participants, a high CDAI diet could still offset these damages.The association between high CDAI and reduced risk of aging is particularly significant in young and middle-aged individuals and non-smokers. Consuming foods rich in CDAI components may potentially lower the risk of aging."
,37887295,Reappraisal of the Concept of Accelerated Aging in Neurodegeneration and Beyond.,Cells,"Genetic and epigenetic changes, oxidative stress and inflammation influence the rate of aging, which diseases, lifestyle and environmental factors can further accelerate. In accelerated aging (AA), the biological age exceeds the chronological age.The objective of this study is to reappraise the AA concept critically, considering its weaknesses and limitations.We reviewed more than 300 recent articles dealing with the physiology of brain aging and neurodegeneration pathophysiology.(1) Application of the AA concept to individual organs outside the brain is challenging as organs of different systems age at different rates. (2) There is a need to consider the deceleration of aging due to the potential use of the individual structure-functional reserves. The latter can be restored by pharmacological and/or cognitive therapy, environment, etc. (3) The AA concept lacks both standardised terminology and methodology. (4) Changes in specific molecular biomarkers (MBM) reflect aging-related processes; however, numerous MBM candidates should be validated to consolidate the AA theory. (5) The exact nature of many potential causal factors, biological outcomes and interactions between the former and the latter remain largely unclear.Although AA is commonly recognised as a perspective theory, it still suffers from a number of gaps and limitations that assume the necessity for an updated AA concept."
,37845359,Relationship between dietary macronutrients intake and biological aging: a cross-sectional analysis of NHANES data.,Eur J Nutr,"This study aimed to investigate the association between macronutrient intake and biological age.Data were collected from 26,381 adults who participated in the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Two biological ages were estimated using the Klemera-Doubal method (KDM) and PhenoAge algorithms. Biological age acceleration (AA) was computed as the difference between biological age and chronological age. The associations between macronutrient intakes and AA were investigated.After fully adjusting for confounding factors, negative associations were observed between AA and fiber intake (KDM-AA: β - 0.53, 95% CI - 0.62, - 0.43, P < 0.05; PhenoAge acceleration: β - 0.30, 95% CI - 0.35, - 0.25, P < 0.05). High-quality carbohydrate intake was associated with decreased AA (KDM-AA: β - 0.57, 95% CI - 0.67, - 0.47, P < 0.05; PhenoAge acceleration: β - 0.32, 95% CI - 0.37, - 0.26, P < 0.05), while low-quality carbohydrate was associated with increased AA (KDM-AA: β 0.30, 95% CI 0.21, 0.38, P < 0.05; PhenoAge acceleration: β 0.16, 95% CI 0.11, 0.21, P < 0.05). Plant protein was associated with decreased AA (KDM-AA: β - 0.39, 95% CI - 0.51, - 0.27, P < 0.05; PhenoAge acceleration: β - 0.21, 95% CI - 0.26, - 0.15, P < 0.05). Long-chain SFA intake increased AA (KDM-AA: β 0.16, 95% CI 0.08, 0.24, P < 0.05; PhenoAge acceleration: β 0.11, 95% CI 0.07, 0.15, P < 0.05). ω-3 PUFA was associated with decreased KDM-AA (β - 0.18, 95% CI - 0.27, - 0.08, P < 0.05) and PhenoAge acceleration (β - 0.09, 95% CI - 0.13, - 0.04, P < 0.05).Our findings suggest that dietary fiber, high-quality carbohydrate, plant protein, and ω-3 PUFA intake may have a protective effect against AA, while low-quality carbohydrate and long-chain SFA intake may increase AA. Therefore, dietary interventions aimed at modifying macronutrient intakes may be useful in preventing or delaying age-related disease and improving overall health.© 2023.

,37810111,Accelerometer-measured physical activity patterns are associated with phenotypic age: Isotemporal substitution effects.,Heliyon,"Prolonged sitting appears to accelerate aging, while optimal physical activity patterns have been found to delay the process. It is an emerging topic, and no conclusions have been reached regarding the relationship between physical activity patterns and biomarkers-measured aging. Hence, the aim of this study was to investigate the association between sensor-based objectively measured physical activity and phenotypic age using a nationwide population from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in the United States. Weighted linear regression models were performed to evaluate the association between sedentary behavior, light-intensity physical activity (LPA), moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and phenotypic age. A total of 6439 eligible participants were included and the weighted respondents were 49,964,300. Results showed that prolonged sitting was positively associated with phenotypic age in the fully adjusted model [β (95% CI): 0.009(0.007,0.011), p < 0.001], while increasing volume of LPA and MVPA was associated with younger phenotypic age using the fully adjusted model [β (95% CI): -0.010(-0.013,-0.006), p < 0.001; -0.062(-0.075,-0.048), p < 0.001]. By utilizing the Isotemporal Substitution Model, it was found that replacing 30 min of sedentary behavior with 30 min of LPA or MVPA per day was associated with estimated 0.4 or 1.9 years of phenotypic age reduction. According to the study's findings, maintaining a certain level of physical activity could delay the process of aging and intensity matters.© 2023 The Authors."
,37782438,NA,NA,"Alström syndrome (AS) is an ultra-rare disorder characterised by early-onset multi-organ dysfunction, such as insulin resistance, obesity, dyslipidaemia, and renal and cardiovascular disease. The objective is to explore whether AS is a disease of accelerated ageing and whether changes over time on echocardiography could reflect accelerated cardiac ageing. Cross-sectional measurement of Phenoage and retrospective analysis of serial echocardiography were performed between March 2012 and November 2022. The setting is a single national tertiary service jointly run by health service and patient charity. Forty-five adult patients aged over 16 years were included, 64% were male and 67% of White ethnicity. The median Phenoage was 48 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 35-72) in the 34 patients for whom this was calculable, which was significantly higher than the median chronological age of 29 years (IQR: 22-39, p<0.001). Phenoage was higher than chronological age in 85% (N=29) of patients, with a median difference of +18 years (IQR: +4, +34). On echocardiography, significant decreases were observed over time in left ventricular (LV) size at end-diastole (average of 0.046 cm per year, p<0.001) and end-systole (1.1% per year, p=0.025), with significant increase in posterior wall thickness at end-diastole (0.009 cm per year, p=0.008). LV systolic function measured by global longitudinal strain reduced (0.34 percentage points per year, p=0.020) and E/e'lat increased (2.5% per year, p=0.019). Most AS patients display a higher Phenoage compared to chronological age. Cardiac changes in AS patients were also reflective of accelerated ageing, with a reduction in LV size and increased wall thickening. AS may be a paradigm disease for premature ageing.© 2023.

The ""response-to-injury"" model proposed by Dr. Russell Ross in 1999 emphasizes inflammation as a critical factor in atherosclerosis development, with atherosclerotic plaques forming due to endothelial cell (EC) injury, followed by myeloid cell adhesion and invasion into the blood vessel walls. Recent evidence indicates that cancer and its treatments can lead to long-term complications, including CVD. Cellular senescence, a hallmark of aging, is implicated in CVD pathogenesis, particularly in cancer survivors. However, the precise mechanisms linking premature senescence to CVD in cancer survivors remain poorly understood.

,37780865,Evaluation of quantitative biomarkers of aging in human PBMCs.,Front Aging,"Functional decline with age contributes significantly to the burden of disease in developed countries. There is growing interest in the development of therapeutic interventions which slow or even reverse aging. Time and cost constraints prohibit the testing of a large number of interventions for health and lifespan extension in model organisms. Cell-based models of aging could enable high throughput testing of potential interventions. Despite extensive reports in the literature of cell properties that correlate with donor age, few are robustly observed across different laboratories. This casts doubt on the extent that aging signatures are captured in cultured cells. We tested molecular changes previously reported to correlate with donor age in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and evaluated their suitability for inclusion in a panel of functional aging measures. The tested measures spanned several pathways implicated in aging including epigenetic changes, apoptosis, proteostasis, and intracellular communication. Surprisingly, only two markers correlated with donor age. DNA methylation age accurately predicted donor age confirming this is a robust aging biomarker. Additionally, the apoptotic marker CD95 correlated with donor age but only within subsets of PBMCs. To demonstrate cellular rejuvenation in response to a treatment will require integration of multiple read-outs of cell function. However, building a panel of measures to detect aging in cells is challenging and further research is needed to identify robust predictors of age in humans.Copyright © 2023 Owen, Phie, Huynh, Needham and Fraser."

We aimed to investigate the relationship between Life's Essential 8 (LE8), a currently updated measure of cardiovascular health (CVH), and biological ageing.This cross-sectional study selected adults ≥ 20 years of age from the 2005-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. LE8 scores (range 0-100) were obtained from measurements based on American Heart Association definitions, divided into health behavior and health factor scores. Biological ageing was assessed by different methods including phenotypic age, phenotypic age acceleration (PhenoAgeAccel), biological age and biological age acceleration (BioAgeAccel). Correlations were analyzed by weighted linear regression and restricted cubic spline models.Of the 11,729 participants included, the mean age was 47.41 ± 0.36 years and 5983 (51.01%) were female. The mean phenotypic and biological ages were 42.96 ± 0.41 and 46.75 ± 0.39 years, respectively, and the mean LE8 score was 67.71 ± 0.35. After adjusting for potential confounders, higher LE8 scores were associated with lower phenotypic age, biological age, PhenoAgeAccel, and BioAgeAccel, with nonlinear dose-response relationships. Negative associations were also found between health behavior and health factor scores and biological ageing, and were stronger for health factors. In health factor-specific analyses, the β negativity was greater for blood glucose and blood pressure. The inverse correlations of LE8 scores with phenotypic age and biological age in the stratified analyses remained solid across strata.LE8 and its subscale scores were strongly negatively related to biological ageing.

,37679407,Evaluating genomic signatures of aging in brain tissue as it relates to Alzheimer's disease.,Sci Rep,"Telomere length (TL) attrition, epigenetic age acceleration, and mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNAcn) decline are established hallmarks of aging. Each has been individually associated with Alzheimer's dementia, cognitive function, and pathologic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Epigenetic age and mtDNAcn have been studied in brain tissue directly but prior work on TL in brain is limited to small sample sizes and most studies have examined leukocyte TL. Importantly, TL, epigenetic age clocks, and mtDNAcn have not been studied jointly in brain tissue from an AD cohort. We examined dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) tissue from N = 367 participants of the Religious Orders Study (ROS) or the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP). TL and mtDNAcn were estimated from whole genome sequencing (WGS) data and cortical clock age was computed on 347 CpG sites. We examined dementia, MCI, and level of and change in cognition, pathologic AD, and three quantitative AD traits, as well as measures of other neurodegenerative diseases and cerebrovascular diseases (CVD). We previously showed that mtDNAcn from DLPFC brain tissue was associated with clinical and pathologic features of AD. Here, we show that those associations are independent of TL. We found TL to be associated with β-amyloid levels (beta = - 0.15, p = 0.023), hippocampal sclerosis (OR = 0.56, p = 0.0015) and cerebral atherosclerosis (OR = 1.44, p = 0.0007). We found strong associations between mtDNAcn and clinical measures of AD. The strongest associations with pathologic measures of AD were with cortical clock and there were associations of mtDNAcn with global AD pathology and tau tangles. Of the other pathologic traits, mtDNAcn was associated with hippocampal sclerosis, macroscopic infarctions and CAA and cortical clock was associated with Lewy bodies. Multi-modal age acceleration, accelerated aging on both mtDNAcn and cortical clock, had greater effect size than a single measure alone. These findings highlight for the first time that age acceleration determined on multiple genomic measures, mtDNAcn and cortical clock may have a larger effect on AD/AD related disorders (ADRD) pathogenesis than single measures.© 2023.

,37892208,NA,NA,"The androgens/androgen receptor (AR) axis is the main therapeutic target in prostate cancer (PCa). However, while initially responsive, a subset of tumors loses AR expression through mechanisms putatively associated with epigenetic modifications. In this study, we assessed the link between the presence of CpG methylation in the 5'UTR and promoter regions of AR and loss of AR expression. Hence, we characterized and compared the methylation signature at CpG resolution of these regulatory regions in vitro, both at basal levels and following treatment with 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (DAC) alone, or in combination with Trichostatin A (TSA). Our results showed heterogeneity in the methylation signature of AR negative cell lines and pinpointed the proximal promoter region as the most consistently methylated site in DU-145. Furthermore, this region was extremely resistant to the demethylating effects of DAC and was only significantly demethylated upon concomitant treatment with TSA. Nevertheless, no AR re-expression was detected at the mRNA or protein level. Importantly, after treatment, there was a significant increase in repressive histone marks at AR region 1 in DU-145 cells. Altogether, our data indicate that AR region 1 genomic availability is crucial for AR expression and that the inhibition of histone methyltransferases might hold promise for AR re-expression."

Reliable genotyping data and pre-selected beneficial loci can be used to improve prediction accuracy. Previously, we reported a low-coverage sequencing genotyping method that yielded 11.3 million highly accurate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in pigs. Here, we introduce a method termed selective linkage disequilibrium pruning (SLDP), which refines the set of SNPs that show a large gain during prediction of complex traits using whole-genome SNP data.We used the SLDP method to identify and select markers among millions of SNPs based on genome-wide association study (GWAS) prior information. We evaluated the performance of SLDP with respect to three real traits and six simulated traits with varying genetic architectures using two representative models (genomic best linear unbiased prediction and BayesR) on samples from 3579 Duroc boars. SLDP was determined by testing 180 combinations of two core parameters (GWAS P-value thresholds and linkage disequilibrium r2). The parameters for each trait were optimized in the training population by five fold cross-validation and then tested in the validation population. Similar to previous GWAS prior-based methods, the performance of SLDP was mainly affected by the genetic architecture of the traits analyzed. Specifically, SLDP performed better for traits controlled by major quantitative trait loci (QTL) or a small number of quantitative trait nucleotides (QTN). Compared with two commercial SNP chips, genotyping-by-sequencing data, and an unselected whole-genome SNP panel, the SLDP strategy led to significant improvements in prediction accuracy, which ranged from 0.84 to 3.22% for real traits controlled by major or moderate QTL and from 1.23 to 11.47% for simulated traits controlled by a small number of QTN.The SLDP marker selection method can be incorporated into mainstream prediction models to yield accuracy improvements for traits with a relatively simple genetic architecture, however, it has no significant advantage for traits not controlled by major QTL. The main factors that affect its performance are the genetic architecture of traits and the reliability of GWAS prior information. Our findings can facilitate the application of WGS-based genomic selection.© 2023. ’Institut National de Recherche en Agriculture, Alimentation et Environnement (INRAE)."

,37877123,Chromatin: the old and young of it.,Front Mol Biosci,"Aging affects nearly all aspects of our cells, from our DNA to our proteins to how our cells handle stress and communicate with each other. Age-related chromatin changes are of particular interest because chromatin can dynamically respond to the cellular and organismal environment, and many modifications at chromatin are reversible. Changes at chromatin occur during aging, and evidence from model organisms suggests that chromatin factors could play a role in modulating the aging process itself, as altering proteins that work at chromatin often affect the lifespan of yeast, worms, flies, and mice. The field of chromatin and aging is rapidly expanding, and high-resolution genomics tools make it possible to survey the chromatin environment or track chromatin factors implicated in longevity with precision that was not previously possible. In this review, we discuss the state of chromatin and aging research. We include examples from yeast,Drosophila, mice, and humans, but we particularly focus on the commonly used aging model, the wormCaenorhabditis elegans, in which there are many examples of chromatin factors that modulate longevity. We include evidence of both age-related changes to chromatin and evidence of specific chromatin factors linked to longevity in core histones, nuclear architecture, chromatin remodeling, and histone modifications.Copyright © 2023 Emerson and Lee."
,37830606,Aging and Age-Related Epigenetic Drift in the Pathogenesis of Leukemia and Lymphomas: New Therapeutic Targets.,Cells,"One of the traits of cancer cells is abnormal DNA methylation patterns. The idea that age-related epigenetic changes may partially explain the increased risk of cancer in the elderly is based on the observation that aging is also accompanied by comparable changes in epigenetic patterns. Lineage bias and decreased stem cell function are signs of hematopoietic stem cell compartment aging. Additionally, aging in the hematopoietic system and the stem cell niche have a role in hematopoietic stem cell phenotypes linked with age, such as leukemia and lymphoma. Understanding these changes will open up promising pathways for therapies against age-related disorders because epigenetic mechanisms are reversible. Additionally, the development of high-throughput epigenome mapping technologies will make it possible to identify the ""epigenomic identity card"" of every hematological disease as well as every patient, opening up the possibility of finding novel molecular biomarkers that can be used for diagnosis, prediction, and prognosis."

This scientific review focuses on the central importance of genomic instability during the aging process, encompassing a range of cellular and molecular changes that occur with advancing age. In particular, this revision addresses the genetic and epigenetic alterations that contribute to genomic instability, such as telomere shortening, DNA damage accumulation, and decreased DNA repair capacity. Furthermore, the review explores the epigenetic changes that occur with aging, including modifications to histones, DNA methylation patterns, and the role of non-coding RNAs. Finally, the review discusses the organization of chromatin and its contribution to genomic instability, including heterochromatin loss, chromatin remodeling, and changes in nucleosome and histone abundance. In conclusion, this review highlights the fundamental role that genomic instability plays in the aging process and underscores the need for continued research into these complex biological mechanisms."
,37754272,Integrated Multimodal Omics and Dietary Approaches for the Management of Neurodegeneration.,Epigenomes,"Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, are caused by a combination of multiple events that damage neuronal function. A well-characterized biomarker of neurodegeneration is the accumulation of proteinaceous aggregates in the brain. However, the gradually worsening symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases are unlikely to be solely due to the result of a mutation in a single gene, but rather a multi-step process involving epigenetic changes. Recently, it has been suggested that a fraction of epigenetic alternations may be correlated to neurodegeneration in the brain. Unlike DNA mutations, epigenetic alterations are reversible, and therefore raise the possibilities for therapeutic intervention, including dietary modifications. Additionally, reactive oxygen species may contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease through epigenetic alternation. Given that the antioxidant properties of plant-derived phytochemicals are likely to exhibit pleiotropic effects against ROS-mediated epigenetic alternation, dietary intervention may be promising for the management of neurodegeneration in these diseases. In this review, the state-of-the-art applications using single-cell multimodal omics approaches, including epigenetics, and dietary approaches for the identification of novel biomarkers and therapeutic approaches for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases are discussed."
,37710009,FOXO transcription factors as mediators of stress adaptation.,Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol,"The forkhead box protein O (FOXO, consisting of FOXO1, FOXO3, FOXO4 and FOXO6) transcription factors are the mammalian orthologues of Caenorhabditis elegans DAF-16, which gained notoriety for its capability to double lifespan in the absence of daf-2 (the gene encoding the worm insulin receptor homologue). Since then, research has provided many mechanistic details on FOXO regulation and FOXO activity. Furthermore, conditional knockout experiments have provided a wealth of data as to how FOXOs control development and homeostasis at the organ and organism levels. The lifespan-extending capabilities of DAF-16/FOXO are highly correlated with their ability to induce stress response pathways. Exogenous and endogenous stress, such as cellular redox stress, are considered the main drivers of the functional decline that characterizes ageing. Functional decline often manifests as disease, and decrease in FOXO activity indeed negatively impacts on major age-related diseases such as cancer and diabetes. In this context, the main function of FOXOs is considered to preserve cellular and organismal homeostasis, through regulation of stress response pathways. Paradoxically, the same FOXO-mediated responses can also aid the survival of dysfunctional cells once these eventually emerge. This general property to control stress responses may underlie the complex and less-evident roles of FOXOs in human lifespan as opposed to model organisms such as C. elegans.© 2023.

,37845234,Genome-wide analysis of the interplay between chromatin-associated RNA and 3D genome organization in human cells.,Nat Commun,"The interphase genome is dynamically organized in the nucleus and decorated with chromatin-associated RNA (caRNA). It remains unclear whether the genome architecture modulates the spatial distribution of caRNA and vice versa. Here, we generate a resource of genome-wide RNA-DNA and DNA-DNA contact maps in human cells. These maps reveal the chromosomal domains demarcated by locally transcribed RNA, hereafter termed RNA-defined chromosomal domains. Further, the spreading of caRNA is constrained by the boundaries of topologically associating domains (TADs), demonstrating the role of the 3D genome structure in modulating the spatial distribution of RNA. Conversely, stopping transcription or acute depletion of RNA induces thousands of chromatin loops genome-wide. Activation or suppression of the transcription of specific genes suppresses or creates chromatin loops straddling these genes. Deletion of a specific caRNA-producing genomic sequence promotes chromatin loops that straddle the interchromosomal target sequences of this caRNA. These data suggest a feedback loop where the 3D genome modulates the spatial distribution of RNA, which in turn affects the dynamic 3D genome organization.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."

,37709751,A landscape of complex tandem repeats within individual human genomes.,Nat Commun,"Markedly expanded tandem repeats (TRs) have been correlated with ~60 diseases. TR diversity has been considered a clue toward understanding missing heritability. However, haplotype-resolved long TRs remain mostly hidden or blacked out because their complex structures (TRs composed of various units and minisatellites containing >10-bp units) make them difficult to determine accurately with existing methods. Here, using a high-precision algorithm to determine complex TR structures from long, accurate reads of PacBio HiFi, an investigation of 270 Japanese control samples yields several genome-wide findings. Approximately 322,000 TRs are difficult to impute from the surrounding single-nucleotide variants. Greater genetic divergence of TR loci is significantly correlated with more events of younger replication slippage. Complex TRs are more abundant than single-unit TRs, and a tendency for complex TRs to consist of <10-bp units and single-unit TRs to be minisatellites is statistically significant at loci with ≥500-bp TRs. Of note, 8909 loci with extended TRs (>100b longer than the mode) contain several known disease-associated TRs and are considered candidates for association with disorders. Overall, complex TRs and minisatellites are found to be abundant and diverse, even in genetically small Japanese populations, yielding insights into the landscape of long TRs.© 2023.

,37809092,Potential drug targets for asthma identified in the plasma and brain through Mendelian randomization analysis.,Front Immunol,"Asthma is a heterogeneous disease, and the involvement of neurogenic inflammation is crucial in its development. The standardized treatments focus on alleviating symptoms. Despite the availability of medications for asthma, they have proven to be inadequate in controlling relapses and halting the progression of the disease. Therefore, there is a need for novel drug targets to prevent asthma.We utilized Mendelian randomization to investigate potential drug targets for asthma. We analyzed summary statistics from the UK Biobank and then replicated our findings in GWAS data by Demenais et al. and the FinnGen cohort. We obtained genetic instruments for 734 plasma and 73 brain proteins from recently reported GWAS. Next, we utilized reverse causal relationship analysis, Bayesian co-localization, and phenotype scanning as part of our sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, we performed a comparison and protein-protein interaction analysis to identify causal proteins. We also analyzed the possible consequences of our discoveries by the given existing asthma drugs and their targets.Using Mendelian randomization analysis, we identified five protein-asthma pairs that were significant at the Bonferroni level (P< 6.35 × 10-5). Specifically, in plasma, we found that an increase of one standard deviation in IL1R1 and ECM1 was associated with an increased risk of asthma, while an increase in ADAM19 was found to be protective. The corresponding odds ratios were 1.03 (95% CI, 1.02-1.04), 1.00 (95% CI, 1.00-1.01), and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.98-0.99), respectively. In the brain, per 10-fold increase in ECM1 (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.03-1.08) and PDLIM4 (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.04-1.07) increased the risk of asthma. Bayesian co-localization found that ECM1 in the plasma (coloc.abf-PPH4 = 0.965) and in the brain (coloc.abf-PPH4 = 0.931) shared the same mutation with asthma. The target proteins of current asthma medications were found to interact with IL1R1. IL1R1 and PDLIM4 were validated in two replication cohorts.Our integrative analysis revealed that asthma risk is causally affected by the levels of IL1R1, ECM1, and PDLIM4. The results suggest that these three proteins have the potential to be used as drug targets for asthma, and further investigation through clinical trials is needed.Copyright © 2023 Wang, Wang, Yan, Liu and Xu."

There have been very few developments in its diagnosis and treatment over the past decades. It is urgently needed to explore potential novel biomarkers and drug targets for SCLC.Methods:Two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) was performed to investigate causal associations between SCLC and plasma proteins using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics of SCLC from Transdisciplinary Research Into Cancer of the Lung Consortium (nCase= 2,791 vs. nControl= 20,580), and was validated in another cohort (nCase= 2,664 vs. nControl= 21,444). 734 plasma proteins and their genetic instruments of cis-acting protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) were used, whereas external plasma proteome data was retrieved from deCODE database. Bidirectional MR, Steiger filtering and phenotype scanning were applied to further verify the associations.Results:Seven significant (p< 6.81 × 10-5) plasma protein-SCLC pairs were identified by MR analysis, including ACP5 (OR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.67-0.86), CPB2 (OR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.86-0.95), GSTM3 (OR = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.33-0.63), SHMT1 (OR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.64-0.86), CTSB (OR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.71-0.88), NTNG1 (OR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.74-0.90) and FAM171B (OR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.21-1.62). The external validation confirmed that CPB2, GSTM3 and NTNG1 had protective effects against SCLC, while FAM171B increased SCLC risk. However, the reverse causality analysis revealed that SCLC caused significant changes in plasma levels of most of these proteins, including decreases of ACP5, CPB2, GSTM3 and NTNG1, and the increase of FAM171B.Conclusion:This integrative analysis firstly suggested the causal associations between SCLC and plasma proteins, and the identified several proteins may be promising novel drug targets or biomarkers for SCLC.Copyright © 2023 Wu, Wang, Yang, Han, Wang, Kang and Zhao."
,37735436,Proteome-wide mendelian randomization study implicates therapeutic targets in common cancers.,J Transl Med,"The interest in targeted cancer therapies has been growing rapidly. While numerous cancer biomarkers and targeted treatment strategies have been developed and employed, there are still significant limitations and challenges in the early diagnosis and targeted treatment of cancers. Accordingly, there is an urgent need to identify novel targets and develop new targeted drugs.The study was conducted using combined cis-Mendelian randomization (cis-MR) and colocalization analysis. We analyzed data from 732 plasma proteins to identify potential drug targets associated with eight site-specific cancers. These findings were further validated using the UK Biobank dataset. Then, a protein-protein interaction network was also constructed to examine the interplay between the identified proteins and the targets of existing cancer medications.This MR analysis revealed associations between five plasma proteins and prostate cancer, five with breast cancer, and three with lung cancer. Subsequently, these proteins were classified into four distinct target groups, with a focus on tier 1 and 2 targets due to their higher potential to become drug targets. Our study indicatied that genetically predicted KDELC2 (OR: 0.89, 95% CI 0.86-0.93) and TNFRSF10B (OR: 0.74, 95% CI 0.65-0.83) are inversely associated with prostate cancer. Furthermore, we observed an inverse association between CPNE1 (OR: 0.96, 95% CI 0.94-0.98) and breast cancer, while PDIA3 (OR: 1.19, 95% CI 1.10-1.30) were found to be associated with the risk of breast cancer. In addition, we also propose that SPINT2 (OR: 1.05, 95% CI 1.03-1.06), GSTP1 (OR: 0.82, 95% CI 0.74-0.90), and CTSS (OR: 0.91, 95% CI 0.88-0.95) may serve as potential therapeutic targets in prostate cancer. Similarly, GDI2 (OR: 0.85, 95% CI 0.80-0.91), ISLR2 (OR: 0.87, 95% CI 0.82-0.93), and CTSF (OR: 1.14, 95% CI 1.08-1.21) could potentially be targets for breast cancer. Additionally, we identified SFTPB (OR: 0.93, 95% CI 0.91-0.95), ICAM5 (OR: 0.95, 95% CI 0.93-0.97), and FLRT3 (OR: 1.10, 95% CI 1.05-1.15) as potential targets for lung cancer.

However, the mechanisms of DNA condensation are not fully understood due to the inability of experiments to access cation distributions and the complex interplay of energetic and entropic forces during assembly. By constructing free energy surfaces using exhaustive sampling and detailed analysis of cation distributions, we elucidate the mechanism of DNA condensation in different salt conditions and with different DNA sequences. We found that DNA condensation is facilitated by the correlated dynamics of the localized cations at the grooves of DNA helices. These dynamics are strongly dependent on the salt conditions and DNA sequences. In the presence of magnesium ions, major groove binding facilitates attraction. In contrast, in the presence of polyvalent cations, minor groove binding serves to create charge patterns, leading to condensation. Our findings present a novel advancement in the field and have broad implications for understanding and controlling nucleic acid complexesin vivoandin vitro."

,37736707,NA,NA,"The mitochondria are central in the cellular response to changing environmental conditions resulting from disease states, environmental exposures or normal physiological processes. Although the influences of environmental stressors upon the nuclear epigenome are well characterized, the existence and role of the mitochondrial epigenome remains contentious. Here, by quantifying the mitochondrial epigenomic response of pineal gland cells to circadian stress, we confirm the presence of extensive cytosine methylation within the mitochondrial genome. Furthermore, we identify distinct epigenetically plastic regions (mtDMRs) which vary in cytosinic methylation, primarily in a non CpG context, in response to stress and in a sex-specific manner. Motifs enriched in mtDMRs contain recognition sites for nuclear-derived DNA-binding factors (ATF4, HNF4A) important in the cellular metabolic stress response, which we found to be conserved across diverse vertebrate taxa. Together, these findings suggest a new layer of mito-nuclear interaction in which the nuclear metabolic stress response could alter mitochondrial transcriptional dynamics through the binding of nuclear-derived transcription factors in a methylation-dependent context.© 2023.

,37872275,NA,NA,"Variants of uncertain significance (VUS) are a significant issue for the molecular diagnosis of rare diseases. The publication of episignatures as effective biomarkers of certain Mendelian neurodevelopmental disorders has raised hopes to help classify VUS. However, prediction abilities of most published episignatures have not been independently investigated yet, which is a prerequisite for an informed and rigorous use in a diagnostic setting. We generated DNA methylation data from 101 carriers of (likely) pathogenic variants in ten different genes, 57 VUS carriers, and 25 healthy controls. Combining published episignature information and new validation data with a k-nearest-neighbour classifier within a leave-one-out scheme, we provide unbiased specificity and sensitivity estimates for each of the signatures. Our procedure reached 100% specificity, but the sensitivities unexpectedly spanned a very large spectrum. While ATRX, DNMT3A, KMT2D, and NSD1 signatures displayed a 100% sensitivity, CREBBP-RSTS and one of the CHD8 signatures reached <40% sensitivity on our dataset. Remaining Cornelia de Lange syndrome, KMT2A, KDM5C and CHD7 signatures reached 70-100% sensitivity at best with unstable performances, suffering from heterogeneous methylation profiles among cases and rare discordant samples. Our results call for cautiousness and demonstrate that episignatures do not perform equally well. Some signatures are ready for confident use in a diagnostic setting. Yet, it is imperative to characterise the actual validity perimeter and interpretation of each episignature with the help of larger validation sample sizes and in a broader set of episignatures.© 2023.

These diseases are characterized by chronic inflammation, and alterations in histone modifications have been linked to their development and progression. Furthermore, the gut microbiota plays a crucial role in regulating immune responses and maintaining gut homeostasis, and it has been shown to exert effects on histone modifications and gene expression in host cells. Recent advances in our understanding of the roles of histone-modifying enzymes and their associated chromatin modifications in IBD and CRC have provided new insights into potential therapeutic interventions. In particular, inhibitors of histone-modifying enzymes have been explored in clinical trials as a possible therapeutic approach for these diseases. This review aims to explore these potential therapeutic interventions and analyze previous and ongoing clinical trials that examined the use of histone-modifying enzyme inhibitors for the treatment of IBD and CRC.

The nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) serves as a principal redox transcriptional factor in the lens, offering a line of defense against oxidative stress. In response to oxidative challenges, Nrf2 dissociates from its inhibitor, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), moves to the nucleus, and binds to the antioxidant response element (ARE) to activate the Nrf2-dependent antioxidant system. In parallel, oxidative stress also induces endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS). Reactive oxygen species (ROS), generated during oxidative stress, can directly damage proteins, causing them to misfold. Initially, the unfolded protein response (UPR) activates to mitigate excessive misfolded proteins. Yet, under persistent or severe stress, the failure to rectify protein misfolding leads to an accumulation of these aberrant proteins, pushing the UPR towards an apoptotic pathway, further contributing to cataractogenesis. Importantly, there is a dynamic interaction between the Nrf2 antioxidant system and the ERS/UPR mechanism in the lens. This interplay, where ERS/UPR can modulate Nrf2 expression and vice versa, holds potential therapeutic implications for cataract prevention and treatment. This review explores the intricate crosstalk between these systems, aiming to illuminate strategies for future advancements in cataract prevention and intervention. The Nrf2-dependent antioxidant system communicates and cross-talks with the ERS/UPR pathway. Both mechanisms are proposed to play pivotal roles in the onset of cataract formation.© 2023.

,37781669,DNA methylation is not associated with sensitization to or dietary introduction of highly allergenic foods in a subset of the CHILD cohort at age 1 year.,J Allergy Clin Immunol Glob,"In the first year of life, DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns are established and are particularly susceptible to exposure-induced changes. Some of these changes may leave lasting effects by persistently altering gene expression or cell type composition or function, contributing to disease.In this discovery study, we investigated DNAm associations with sensitization to peanut, egg, or cow's milk and hypothesized that genes demonstrating DNAm differences in immune cells may play a role in the development of food sensitization.Infant sensitization (a skin prick test wheal size that is at least 2 mm greater than the negative control) was measured to peanut, egg, and cow's milk at age 1 year, and ages of food introduction were reported prospectively. PBMC DNAm was measured in blood samples at 1 year in 144 infants, oversampled for atopy or wheeze. Statistical analysis of Illumina 450k array DNAm data was conducted in R with adjustment for clinical and genetic covariables and a minimum effect size of 1%, false discovery rate of 5%, and medium-confidence false discovery rate threshold of 20%.There were no DNAm differences between infants with and without peanut, egg, or cow's milk sensitization. Borderline significant sites with high effect sizes were enriched for methylation quantitative trait loci, hinting at genetic factors influencing DNAm at these sites. DNAm patterns did not differ by peanut or egg introduction before or after 12 months.This small pilot study did not show differences in methylation by food sensitization or introduction, but it did demonstrate DNAm patterns linked to genetic variants.© 2023 The Authors."
,37660305,NA,NA,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common metabolic disorder, usually diagnosed during the third trimester of pregnancy that usually disappears after delivery. In GDM, the excess of glucose, fatty acids, and amino acids results in foetuses large for gestational age. Hyperglycaemia and insulin resistance accelerate the metabolism, raising the oxygen demand, and creating chronic hypoxia and inflammation. Women who experienced GDM and their offspring are at risk of developing type-2 diabetes, obesity, and other metabolic or cardiovascular conditions later in life. Genetic factors may predispose the development of GDM; however, they do not account for all GDM cases; lifestyle and diet also play important roles in GDM development by modulating epigenetic signatures and the body's microbial composition; therefore, this is a condition with a complex, multifactorial aetiology. In this context, we revised published reports describing GDM-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), DNA methylation and microRNA expression in different tissues (such as placenta, umbilical cord, adipose tissue, and peripheral blood), and microbial composition in the gut, oral cavity, and vagina from pregnant women with GDM, as well as the bacterial composition of the offspring. Altogether, these reports indicate that a number of SNPs are associated to GDM phenotypes and may predispose the development of the disease. However, extrinsic factors (lifestyle, nutrition) modulate, through epigenetic mechanisms, the risk of developing the disease, and some association exists between the microbial composition with GDM in an organ-specific manner. Genes, epigenetic signatures, and microbiota could be transferred to the offspring, increasing the possibility of developing chronic degenerative conditions through postnatal life.© 2023.

,37761822,Epigenetic Modulations for Prevention of Infectious Diseases in Shrimp Aquaculture.,Genes (Basel),"Aquaculture assumes a pivotal role in meeting the escalating global food demand, and shrimp farming, in particular, holds a significant role in the global economy and food security, providing a rich source of nutrients for human consumption. Nonetheless, the industry faces formidable challenges, primarily attributed to disease outbreaks and the diminishing efficacy of conventional disease management approaches, such as antibiotic usage. Consequently, there is an urgent imperative to explore alternative strategies to ensure the sustainability of the industry. In this context, the field of epigenetics emerges as a promising avenue for combating infectious diseases in shrimp aquaculture. Epigenetic modulations entail chemical alterations in DNA and proteins, orchestrating gene expression patterns without modifying the underlying DNA sequence through DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNA molecules. Utilizing epigenetic mechanisms presents an opportunity to enhance immune gene expression and bolster disease resistance in shrimp, thereby contributing to disease management strategies and optimizing shrimp health and productivity. Additionally, the concept of epigenetic inheritability in marine animals holds immense potential for the future of the shrimp farming industry. To this end, this comprehensive review thoroughly explores the dynamics of epigenetic modulations in shrimp aquaculture, with a particular emphasis on its pivotal role in disease management. It conveys the significance of harnessing advantageous epigenetic changes to ensure the long-term viability of shrimp farming while deliberating on the potential consequences of these interventions. Overall, this appraisal highlights the promising trajectory of epigenetic applications, propelling the field toward strengthening sustainability in shrimp aquaculture."
,37865667,Expanding causal genes for Parkinson's disease via multi-omics analysis.,NPJ Parkinsons Dis,"Genome‑wide association studies (GWASs) have revealed numerous loci associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, some potential causal/risk genes were still not revealed and no etiological therapies are available. To find potential causal genes and explore genetically supported drug targets for PD is urgent. By integrating the expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) datasets from multiple tissues (blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain) and PD GWAS summary statistics, a pipeline combing Mendelian randomization (MR), Steiger filtering analysis, Bayesian colocalization, fine mapping, Protein-protein network and enrichment analysis were applied to identify potential causal genes for PD. As a result, GPNMB displayed a robust causal role for PD at the protein level in the blood, CSF and brain, and transcriptional level in the brain, while the protective role of CD38 (in brain pQTL and eQTL) was also identified. We also found inconsistent roles of DGKQ on PD between protein and mRNA levels. Another 9 proteins (CTSB, ARSA, SEC23IP, CD84, ENTPD1, FCGR2B, BAG3, SNCA, FCGR2A) were associated with the risk for PD based on only a single pQTL after multiple corrections. We also identified some proteins' interactions with known PD causative genes and therapeutic targets. In conclusion, this study suggested GPNMB, CD38, and DGKQ may act in the pathogenesis of PD, but whether the other proteins involved in PD needs more evidence. These findings would help to uncover the genes underlying PD and prioritize targets for future therapeutic interventions.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."
,37779905,"Metabolite profiles and DNA methylation in metabolic syndrome: a two-sample, bidirectional Mendelian randomization.",Front Genet,"Introduction:Metabolic syndrome (MetS) increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and death. Previous '-omics' studies have identified dysregulated serum metabolites and aberrant DNA methylation in the setting of MetS. However, the relationship between the metabolome and epigenome have not been elucidated. In this study, we identified serum metabolites associated with MetS and DNA methylation, and we conducted bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) to assess causal relationships between metabolites and methylation.Methods:We leveraged metabolomic and genomic data from a national United States cohort of older adults (REGARDS), as well as metabolomic, epigenomic, and genomic data from a family-based study of hypertension (HyperGEN). We conducted metabolite profiling for MetS in REGARDS using weighted logistic regression models and validated them in HyperGEN. Validated metabolites were selected for methylation studies which fit linear mixed models between metabolites and six CpG sites previously linked to MetS. Statistically significant metabolite-CpG pairs were selected for two-sample, bidirectional MR.Results:Forward MR indicated that glucose and serine metabolites were causal on CpG methylation nearCPT1A[B(SE): -0.003 (0.002),p= 0.028 and B(SE): 0.029 (0.011),p= 0.030, respectively] and that serine metabolites were causal onABCG1[B(SE): -0.008(0.003),p= 0.006] andSREBF1[B(SE): -0.009(0.004),p= 0.018] methylation,which suggested a protective effect of serine. Reverse MR showed a bidirectional relationship between cg06500161 (ABCG1) and serine [B(SE): -1.534 (0.668),p= 0.023].Discussion:The metabolome may contribute to the relationship between MetS and epigenetic modifications.Copyright © 2023 Jones, Ament, Patki, Chaudhary, Srinivasasainagendra, Kijpaisalratana, Absher, Tiwari, Arnett, Kimberly and Irvin."
,37857935,Integrative analyses highlight functional regulatory variants associated with neuropsychiatric diseases.,Nat Genet,"Noncoding variants of presumed regulatory function contribute to the heritability of neuropsychiatric disease. A total of 2,221 noncoding variants connected to risk for ten neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, major depression, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and schizophrenia, were studied in developing human neural cells. Integrating epigenomic and transcriptomic data with massively parallel reporter assays identified differentially-active single-nucleotide variants (daSNVs) in specific neural cell types. Expression-gene mapping, network analyses and chromatin looping nominated candidate disease-relevant target genes modulated by these daSNVs. Follow-up integration of daSNV gene editing with clinical cohort analyses suggested that magnesium transport dysfunction may increase neuropsychiatric disease risk and indicated that common genetic pathomechanisms may mediate specific symptoms that are shared across multiple neuropsychiatric diseases.© 2023.

,37845353,NA,NA,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a common disease with substantial heritability. In this study, we performed a genome-wide association meta-analysis from 14 discovery cohorts and uncovered 141 independent associations, including 97 previously unreported loci. A polygenic risk score derived from meta-analysis explained AAA risk beyond clinical risk factors. Genes at AAA risk loci indicate involvement of lipid metabolism, vascular development and remodeling, extracellular matrix dysregulation and inflammation as key mechanisms in AAA pathogenesis. These genes also indicate overlap between the development of AAA and other monogenic aortopathies, particularly via transforming growth factor β signaling. Motivated by the strong evidence for the role of lipid metabolism in AAA, we used Mendelian randomization to establish the central role of nonhigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol in AAA and identified the opportunity for repurposing of proprotein convertase, subtilisin/kexin-type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors. This was supported by a study demonstrating that PCSK9 loss of function prevented the development of AAA in a preclinical mouse model.© 2023.

,37799268,Modeling of horizontal pleiotropy identifies possible causal gene expression in systemic lupus erythematosus.,Front Lupus,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune condition with complex causes involving genetic and environmental factors. While genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified genetic loci associated with SLE, the functional genomic elements responsible for disease development remain largely unknown. Mendelian Randomization (MR) is an instrumental variable approach to causal inference based on data from observational studies, where genetic variants are employed as instrumental variables (IVs).This study utilized a two-step strategy to identify causal genes for SLE. In the first step, the classical MR method was employed, assuming the absence of horizontal pleiotropy, to estimate the causal effect of gene expression on SLE. In the second step, advanced probabilistic MR methods (PMR-Egger, MRAID, and MR-MtRobin) were applied to the genes identified in the first step, considering horizontal pleiotropy, to filter out false positives. PMR-Egger and MRAID analyses utilized whole blood expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and SLE GWAS summary data, while MR-MtRobin analysis used an independent eQTL dataset from multiple immune cell types along with the same SLE GWAS data.The initial MR analysis identified 142 genes, including 43 outside of chromosome 6. Subsequently, applying the advanced MR methods reduced the number of genes with significant causal effects on SLE to 66. PMR-Egger, MRAID, and MR-MtRobin, respectively, identified 13, 7, and 16 non-chromosome 6 genes with significant causal effects. All methods identified expression ofPHRF1gene as causal for SLE. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to enhance understanding of the functional roles and mechanisms of the identified genes in SLE development.The findings from the three MR methods exhibited overlapping genes with causal effects on SLE, demonstrating consistent results. However, each method also uncovered unique genes due to different modelling assumptions and technical factors, highlighting the complementary nature of the approaches. Importantly, MRAID demonstrated a reduced percentage of causal genes from the Major Histocompatibility complex (MHC) region on chromosome 6, indicating its potential in minimizing false positive findings. This study contributes to unraveling the mechanisms underlying SLE by employing advanced probabilistic MR methods to identify causal genes, thereby enhancing our understanding of SLE pathogenesis."
,37770633,Multitissue H3K27ac profiling of GTEx samples links epigenomic variation to disease.,Nat Genet,"Genetic variants associated with complex traits are primarily noncoding, and their effects on gene-regulatory activity remain largely uncharacterized. To address this, we profile epigenomic variation of histone mark H3K27ac across 387 brain, heart, muscle and lung samples from Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx). We annotate 282 k active regulatory elements (AREs) with tissue-specific activity patterns. We identify 2,436 sex-biased AREs and 5,397 genetically influenced AREs associated with 130 k genetic variants (haQTLs) across tissues. We integrate genetic and epigenomic variation to provide mechanistic insights for disease-associated loci from 55 genome-wide association studies (GWAS), by revealing candidate tissues of action, driver SNPs and impacted AREs. Lastly, we build ARE-gene linking scores based on genetics (gLink scores) and demonstrate their unique ability to prioritize SNP-ARE-gene circuits. Overall, our epigenomic datasets, computational integration and mechanistic predictions provide valuable resources and important insights for understanding the molecular basis of human diseases/traits such as schizophrenia.© 2023.

However, the efficiency and precision of base editing perturbations vary, confounding the assessment of variant-induced phenotypic effects. Here, we provide an integrated pipeline that improves the estimation of variant impact in base editing screens. We perform high-throughput ABE8e-SpRY base editing screens with an integrated reporter construct to measure the editing efficiency and outcomes of each gRNA alongside their phenotypic consequences. We introduce BEAN, a Bayesian network that accounts for per-guide editing outcomes and target site chromatin accessibility to estimate variant impacts. We show this pipeline attains superior performance compared to existing tools in variant classification and effect size quantification. We use BEAN to pinpoint common variants that alter LDL uptake, implicating novel genes. Additionally, through saturation base editing ofLDLR, we enable accurate quantitative prediction of the effects of missense variants on LDL-C levels, which aligns with measurements in UK Biobank individuals, and identify structural mechanisms underlying variant pathogenicity. This work provides a widely applicable approach to improve the power of base editor screens for disease-associated variant characterization."
,37726359,NA,NA,"Schizophrenia is a debilitating psychiatric disorder associated with a reduced fertility and decreased life expectancy, yet common predisposing variation substantially contributes to the onset of the disorder, which poses an evolutionary paradox. Previous research has suggested balanced selection, a mechanism by which schizophrenia risk alleles could also provide advantages under certain environments, as a reliable explanation. However, recent studies have shown strong evidence against a positive selection of predisposing loci. Furthermore, evolutionary pressures on schizophrenia risk alleles could have changed throughout human history as new environments emerged. Here in this study, we used 1000 Genomes Project data to explore the relationship between schizophrenia predisposing loci and recent natural selection (RNS) signatures after the human diaspora out of Africa around 100,000 years ago on a genome-wide scale. We found evidence for significant enrichment of RNS markers in derived alleles arisen during human evolution conferring protection to schizophrenia. Moreover, both partitioned heritability and gene set enrichment analyses of mapped genes from schizophrenia predisposing loci subject to RNS revealed a lower involvement in brain and neuronal related functions compared to those not subject to RNS. Taken together, our results suggest non-antagonistic pleiotropy as a likely mechanism behind RNS that could explain the persistence of schizophrenia common predisposing variation in human populations due to its association to other non-psychiatric phenotypes.© 2023.

However, identification of trait-relevant cell populations is often impeded by inherent technical noise and high sparsity in scRNA-seq data. Here, we developed scPagwas, a computational approach that uncovers trait-relevant cellular context by integrating pathway activation transformation of scRNA-seq data and GWAS summary statistics. scPagwas effectively prioritizes trait-relevant genes, which facilitates identification of trait-relevant cell types/populations with high accuracy in extensive simulated and real datasets. Cellular-level association results identified a novel subpopulation of naive CD8+T cells related to COVID-19 severity and oligodendrocyte progenitor cell and microglia subsets with critical pathways by which genetic variants influence Alzheimer's disease. Overall, our approach provides new insights for the discovery of trait-relevant cell types and improves the mechanistic understanding of disease variants from a pathway perspective.© 2023 The Author(s)."
,37689782,Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms.,Nat Commun,"Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."
,37904118,Genetic correlation for alcohol consumption between Europeans and East Asians.,BMC Genomics,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many genetic variants associated with alcohol consumption in Europeans and East Asians, as well as other populations. However, the genetic homogeneity and heterogeneity between these populations have not been thoroughly investigated, despite evidence of varying effect sizes of variants between ethnicities and the presence of population-specific strong signals of selection on loci associated with alcohol consumption. In order to better understand the relationship between Europeans and East Asians in the genetic architecture of alcohol consumption, we compared their heritability and evaluated their genetic correlation using GWAS results from UK Biobank (UKB) and Biobank Japan (BBJ). We found that these two populations have low genetic correlation due to the large difference on chromosome 12. After excluding this chromosome, the genetic correlation was moderately high ([Formula: see text] = 0.544, p = 1.12e-4) and 44.31% of the genome-wide causal variants were inferred to be shared between Europeans and East Asians. Given those observations, we conducted a meta-analysis on UKB and BBJ and identified new signals, including the CADM2 gene on chromosome 3, which has been associated with various behavioral and metabolic traits. Overall, our findings suggest that the genetic architecture of alcohol consumption is largely shared between Europeans and East Asians, but there are exceptions such as the enrichment of heritability on chromosome 12 in East Asians.© 2023.

,37777856,NA,NA,"Suicidal behavior is heritable and is a major cause of death worldwide. Two large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWASs) recently discovered and cross-validated genome-wide significant (GWS) loci for suicide attempt (SA). The present study leveraged the genetic cohorts from both studies to conduct the largest GWAS meta-analysis of SA to date. Multi-ancestry and admixture-specific meta-analyses were conducted within groups of significant African, East Asian, and European ancestry admixtures.This study comprised 22 cohorts, including 43,871 SA cases and 915,025 ancestry-matched controls. Analytical methods across multi-ancestry and individual ancestry admixtures included inverse variance-weighted fixed-effects meta-analyses, followed by gene, gene-set, tissue-set, and drug-target enrichment, as well as summary-data-based Mendelian randomization with brain expression quantitative trait loci data, phenome-wide genetic correlation, and genetic causal proportion analyses.Multi-ancestry and European ancestry admixture GWAS meta-analyses identified 12 risk loci at p values <5×10-8. These loci were mostly intergenic and implicatedDRD2,SLC6A9,FURIN,NLGN1,SOX5,PDE4B, andCACNG2. The multi-ancestry SNP-based heritability estimate of SA was 5.7% on the liability scale (SE=0.003, p=5.7×10-80). Significant brain tissue gene expression and drug set enrichment were observed. There was shared genetic variation of SA with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, smoking, and risk tolerance after conditioning SA on both major depressive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder. Genetic causal proportion analyses implicated shared genetic risk for specific health factors.This multi-ancestry analysis of suicide attempt identified several loci contributing to risk and establishes significant shared genetic covariation with clinical phenotypes. These findings provide insight into genetic factors associated with suicide attempt across ancestry admixture populations, in veteran and civilian populations, and in attempt versus death."

,37716973,"The association between prenatal famine, DNA methylation and mental disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",Clin Epigenetics,"Undernutrition in pregnant women is an unfavorable environmental condition that can affect the intrauterine development via epigenetic mechanisms and thus have long-lasting detrimental consequences for the mental health of the offspring later in life. One epigenetic mechanism that has been associated with mental disorders and undernutrition is alterations in DNA methylation. The effect of prenatal undernutrition on the mental health of adult offspring can be analyzed through quasi-experimental studies such as famine studies. The present systematic review and meta-analysis aims to analyze the association between prenatal famine exposure, DNA methylation, and mental disorders in adult offspring. We further investigate whether altered DNA methylation as a result of prenatal famine exposure is prospectively linked to mental disorders.We conducted a systematic search of the databases PubMed and PsycINFO to identify relevant records up to September 2022 on offspring whose mothers experienced famine directly before and/or during pregnancy, examining the impact of prenatal famine exposure on the offspring's DNA methylation and/or mental disorders or symptoms.The systematic review showed that adults who were prenatally exposed to famine had an increased risk of schizophrenia and depression. Several studies reported an association between prenatal famine exposure and hyper- or hypomethylation of specific genes. The largest number of studies reported differences in DNA methylation of the IGF2 gene. Altered DNA methylation of the DUSP22 gene mediated the association between prenatal famine exposure and schizophrenia in adult offspring. Meta-analysis confirmed the increased risk of schizophrenia following prenatal famine exposure. For DNA methylation, meta-analysis was not suitable due to different microarrays/data processing approaches and/or unavailable data.Prenatal famine exposure is associated with an increased risk of mental disorders and DNA methylation changes. The findings suggest that changes in DNA methylation of genes involved in neuronal, neuroendocrine, and immune processes may be a mechanism that promotes the development of mental disorders such as schizophrenia and depression in adult offspring. Such findings are crucial given that undernutrition has risen worldwide, increasing the risk of famine and thus also of negative effects on mental health.© 2023.

,37732532,Alteration of relative telomere length and telomerase reverse transcriptase expression in the granulosa cells of women during aging and assessment of in vitro fertilization outcomes.,Mol Med Rep,"Telomere attrition plays a critical role in the reproductive aging process in humans. Telomere length (TL) is typically regulated by telomerase, the main component of which is telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT). The aim of the present study was to investigate the changes of relative TL (RTL) and TERT expression in granulosa cells (GCs) during aging and its association with reproduction. Clinical data on the frozen‑thawed embryo transfer cycles of older (>35 year old) and younger (≤35 year old) women from a single center over a 3‑year period were retrospectively analyzed. Preimplantation genetic testing for chromosome aneuploidies in older women during the same period was also analyzed. Following the analysis of the data, several biological characteristics of senescent GCs were explored. In addition, a total of 160 women who were undergoing their ﬁrst fresh cycle ofin vitrofertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection were included in the study. GCs were collected from all participants. The changes of RTL and TERT expression in GCs during aging were investigated using quantitative PCR and western blotting. The associations of RTL and TERT with IVF outcomes were also assessed. The clinical data demonstrated that the pregnancy and live birth rates of women aged >35 years were ~20% lower than those of women aged ≤35 years, and the number of embryos with aneuploidy was 7‑fold of that without euploidy in the older age group. An aging‑induced change in follicle stimulating hormone receptor expression was observed. A shorter TL and increased TERT expression were detected in the older women. A significant inverse correlation between the expression levels of TERT and oocyte yield was identified. However, no association of RTL and TERT with blastocyst formation rate and the probability of clinical pregnancy was detected. It may be concluded that RTL and TERT alterations in GCs are potential determinants of ovarian aging. TERT expression in GCs appears to be a potential biomarker for the prediction of ovarian response, which provides a novel strategy for the assessment of female fertility."
,37884562,NA,NA,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most important causes of disability worldwide. While recent work provides insights into the molecular alterations in the brain of patients with MDD, whether these molecular signatures can be associated with the expression of specific symptom domains remains unclear. Here, we identified sex-specific gene modules associated with the expression of MDD, combining differential gene expression and co-expression network analyses in six cortical and subcortical brain regions. Our results show varying levels of network homology between males and females across brain regions, although the associations between these structures and the expression of MDD remain highly sex specific. We refined these associations to several symptom domains and identified transcriptional signatures associated with distinct functional pathways, including GABAergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission, metabolic processes and intracellular signal transduction, across brain regions associated with distinct symptomatic profiles in a sex-specific fashion. In most cases, these associations were specific to males or to females with MDD, although a subset of gene modules associated with common symptomatic features in both sexes were also identified. Together, our findings suggest that the expression of distinct MDD symptom domains associates with sex-specific transcriptional structures across brain regions.© 2023. The Author(s)."
,37822767,Ribosomal dysregulation: A conserved pathophysiological mechanism in human depression and mouse chronic stress.,PNAS Nexus,"The underlying biological mechanisms that contribute to the heterogeneity of major depressive disorder (MDD) presentation remain poorly understood, highlighting the need for a conceptual framework that can explain this variability and bridge the gap between animal models and clinical endpoints. Here, we hypothesize that comparative analysis of molecular data from different experimental systems of chronic stress, and MDD has the potential to provide insight into these mechanisms and address this gap. Thus, we compared transcriptomic profiles of brain tissue from postmortem MDD subjects and from mice exposed to chronic variable stress (CVS) to identify orthologous genes. Ribosomal protein genes (RPGs) were down-regulated, and associated ribosomal protein (RP) pseudogenes were up-regulated in both conditions. A seeded gene co-expression analysis using altered RPGs common between the MDD and CVS groups revealed that down-regulated RPGs homeostatically regulated the synaptic changes in both groups through a RP-pseudogene-driven mechanism. In vitro analysis demonstrated that the RPG dysregulation was a glucocorticoid-driven endocrine response to stress. In silico analysis further demonstrated that the dysregulation was reversed during remission from MDD and selectively responded to ketamine but not to imipramine. This study provides the first evidence that ribosomal dysregulation during stress is a conserved phenotype in human MDD and chronic stress-exposed mouse. Our results establish a foundation for the hypothesis that stress-induced alterations in RPGs and, consequently, ribosomes contribute to the synaptic dysregulation underlying MDD and chronic stress-related mood disorders. We discuss the role of ribosomal heterogeneity in the variable presentations of depression and other mood disorders.© The Author(s) 2023.

Activated myeloid cells express CD13, which facilitates their migration into the site of injury. However, angiogenic blood vessels which play a role in recovery also express CD13. Overall, the specific contribution of CD13 to acute and chronic stroke outcomes is unknown.CD13 expression was estimated in both mice and humans after the ischemic stroke. Young (8-12 weeks) male wild-type and global CD13 knockout (KO) mice were used for this study. Mice underwent 60 min of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by reperfusion. For acute studies, the mice were euthanized at either 24- or 72 h post-stroke. For chronic studies, the Y-maze, Barnes maze, and the open field were performed on day 7 and day 28 post-stroke. Mice were euthanized at day 30 post-stroke and the brains were collected for assessment of inflammation, white matter injury, tissue loss, and angiogenesis. Flow cytometry was performed on days 3 and 7 post-stroke to quantify infiltrated monocytes and neutrophils and CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling.Brain CD13 expression and infiltrated CD13+monocytes and neutrophils increased acutely after the stroke. The brain CD13+lectin+blood vessels increased on day 15 after the stroke. Similarly, an increase in the percentage area CD13 was observed in human stroke patients at the subacute time after stroke. Deletion of CD13 resulted in reduced infarct volume and improved neurological recovery after acute stroke. However, CD13KO mice had significantly worse memory deficits, amplified gliosis, and white matter damage compared to wild-type animals at chronic time points. CD13-deficient mice had an increased percentage of CXCL12+cells but a reduced percentage of CXCR4+cells and decreased angiogenesis at day 30 post-stroke.CD13 is involved in the trans-migration of monocytes and neutrophils after stroke, and acutely, led to decreased infarct size and improved behavioral outcomes. However, loss of CD13 led to reductions in post-stroke angiogenesis by reducing CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling.© 2023. BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature."
,37761863,NA,NA,"The prevalence of depressive symptoms in adolescents is 12-18% and is twice as frequent in females. Sleep problems and thoughts of death are depressive symptoms or co-occurrent phenomena. Family maltreatment is a risk factor for later depressive symptoms and the period circadian regulator (PER) has been studied in relation to neurotransmitters, adaptation to stress, and winter depression. The purpose of this work was to study the relation of the three-way interactions of sex, PER2rs56013859, and family maltreatment in relation to core depressive symptoms, sleep complaints, and thoughts of death and suicide in self-reports from a cohort of Swedish adolescents in 2012, 2015, and 2018. Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses with linear and logistic regressions were used to study the relationships to the three outcomes. The three-way interaction was related to core depressive symptoms at both baseline and six years later. In contrast, the model did not show any relation to the other dependent variables. At 13-15 years, a sex-related differential expression was observed: females with the minor allele C:C/C:T exposed to family maltreatment showed higher levels of core depressive symptoms. Six years later, the trend was inverted among carriers of minor alleles."
,37735504,Sex- and suicide-specific alterations in the kynurenine pathway in the anterior cingulate cortex in major depression.,Neuropsychopharmacology,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a serious psychiatric disorder that in extreme cases can lead to suicide. Evidence suggests that alterations in the kynurenine pathway (KP) contribute to the pathology of MDD. Activation of the KP leads to the formation of neuroactive metabolites, including kynurenic acid (KYNA) and quinolinic acid (QUIN). To test for changes in the KP, postmortem anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was obtained from the National Institute of Health NeuroBioBank. Gene expression of KP enzymes and relevant neuroinflammatory markers were investigated via RT-qPCR (Fluidigm) and KP metabolites were measured using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in tissue from individuals with MDD (n = 44) and matched nonpsychiatric controls (n = 36). We report increased IL6 and IL1B mRNA in MDD. Subgroup analysis found that female MDD subjects had significantly decreased KYNA and a trend decrease in the KYNA/QUIN ratio compared to female controls. In addition, MDD subjects that died by suicide had significantly decreased KYNA in comparison to controls and MDD subjects that did not die by suicide, while subjects that did not die by suicide had increased KYAT2 mRNA, which we hypothesise may protect against a decrease in KYNA. Overall, we found sex- and suicide-specific alterations in the KP in the ACC in MDD. This is the first molecular evidence in the brain of subgroup specific changes in the KP in MDD, which not only suggests that treatments aimed at upregulation of the KYNA arm in the brain may be favourable for female MDD sufferers but also might assist managing suicidal behaviour.© 2023.

,37723284,Functional genomic mechanisms of opioid action and opioid use disorder: a systematic review of animal models and human studies.,Mol Psychiatry,"In the past two decades, over-prescription of opioids for pain management has driven a steep increase in opioid use disorder (OUD) and death by overdose, exerting a dramatic toll on western countries. OUD is a chronic relapsing disease associated with a lifetime struggle to control drug consumption, suggesting that opioids trigger long-lasting brain adaptations, notably through functional genomic and epigenomic mechanisms. Current understanding of these processes, however, remain scarce, and have not been previously reviewed systematically. To do so, the goal of the present work was to synthesize current knowledge on genome-wide transcriptomic and epigenetic mechanisms of opioid action, in primate and rodent species. Using a prospectively registered methodology, comprehensive literature searches were completed in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science. Of the 2709 articles identified, 73 met our inclusion criteria and were considered for qualitative analysis. Focusing on the 5 most studied nervous system structures (nucleus accumbens, frontal cortex, whole striatum, dorsal striatum, spinal cord; 44 articles), we also conducted a quantitative analysis of differentially expressed genes, in an effort to identify a putative core transcriptional signature of opioids. Only one gene, Cdkn1a, was consistently identified in eleven studies, and globally, our results unveil surprisingly low consistency across published work, even when considering most recent single-cell approaches. Analysis of sources of variability detected significant contributions from species, brain structure, duration of opioid exposure, strain, time-point of analysis, and batch effects, but not type of opioid. To go beyond those limitations, we leveraged threshold-free methods to illustrate how genome-wide comparisons may generate new findings and hypotheses. Finally, we discuss current methodological development in the field, and their implication for future research and, ultimately, better care.© 2023. The Author(s)."
,37704386,Why and How to Account for Sex and Gender in Brain and Behavioral Research.,J Neurosci,"Long overlooked in neuroscience research, sex and gender are increasingly included as key variables potentially impacting all levels of neurobehavioral analysis. Still, many neuroscientists do not understand the difference between the terms ""sex"" and ""gender,"" the complexity and nuance of each, or how to best include them as variables in research designs. This TechSights article outlines rationales for considering the influence of sex and gender across taxa, and provides technical guidance for strengthening the rigor and reproducibility of such analyses. This guidance includes the use of appropriate statistical methods for comparing groups as well as controls for key covariates of sex (e.g., total intracranial volume) and gender (e.g., income, caregiver stress, bias). We also recommend approaches for interpreting and communicating sex- and gender-related findings about the brain, which have often been misconstrued by neuroscientists and the lay public alike.Copyright © 2023 the authors."
,37693466,The pivotal role of the X-chromosome in the genetic architecture of the human brain.,medRxiv,"Genes on the X-chromosome are extensively expressed in the human brain, resulting in substantial influences on brain development, intellectual disability, and other brain-related disorders. To comprehensively investigate the X-chromosome's impact on the cerebral cortex, white matter tract microstructures, and intrinsic and extrinsic brain functions, we examined 2,822 complex brain imaging traits obtained fromn=34,000subjects in the UK Biobank. We unveiled potential autosome-X-chromosome interaction, while proposing an atlas of dosage compensation (DC) for each set of traits. We observed a pronounced X-chromosome impact on the corticospinal tract and the functional amplitude and connectivity of visual networks. In association studies, we identified 50 genome-wide significant trait-locus pairs enriched in Xq28, 22 of which replicated in independent datasets (n=4,900). Notably, 13 newly identified pairs were in the X-chromosome's non-pseudo-autosomal regions (NPR). The volume of the right ventral diencephalon shared genetic architecture with schizophrenia and educational attainment in a locus indexed by rs2361468 (located ~3kb upstream ofPJA1, a conserved and ubiquitously expressed gene implicated in multiple psychiatric disorders). No significant associations were identified in the pseudo-autosomal regions (PAR) or the Y-chromosome. Finally, we explored sex-specific associations on the X-chromosome and compared differing genetic effects between sexes. We found much more associations can be identified in males (33 versus 9) given a similar sample size. In conclusion, our research provides invaluable insights into the X-chromosome's role in the human brain, contributing to the observed sex differences in brain structure and function."
,37693465,Relationship between sex biases in gene expression and sex biases in autism and Alzheimer's disease.,medRxiv,"Sex differences in the brain may play an important role in sex-differential prevalence of neuropsychiatric conditions. In order to understand the transcriptional basis of sex differences, we analyzed multiple, large-scale, human postmortem brain RNA-seq datasets using both within-region and pan-regional frameworks. We find evidence of sex-biased transcription in many autosomal genes, some of which provide evidence for pathways and cell population differences between chromosomally male and female individuals. These analyses also highlight regional differences in the extent of sex-differential gene expression. We observe an increase in specific neuronal transcripts in male brains and an increase in immune and glial function-related transcripts in female brains. Integration with single-cell data suggests this corresponds to sex differences in cellular states rather than cell abundance. Integration with case-control gene expression studies suggests a female molecular predisposition towards Alzheimer's disease, a female-biased disease. Autism, a male-biased diagnosis, does not exhibit a male predisposition pattern in our analysis. Finally, we provide region specific analyses of sex differences in brain gene expression to enable additional studies at the interface of gene expression and diagnostic differences."
,37781451,An evidence-based debate on epigenetics and immunosenescence in COVID-19.,Curr Res Immunol,"Immunosenescence contributes to the decline of immune function leading to a reduced ability to respond to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in elderly patients. Clinical course of COVID-19 is widely heterogeneous and guided by the possible interplay between genetic background and epigenetic-sensitive mechanisms underlying the immunosenescence which could explain, at least in part, the higher percentage of disease severity in elderly individuals. The most convincing evidence regards the hypomethylation of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) promoter gene in lungs as well as the citrullination of histone H3 in neutrophils which have been associated with worsening of COVID-19 outcome in elderly patients. In contrast, centenarians who have showed milder symptoms have been associated to a younger ""epigenetic age"" based on DNA methylation profiles at specific genomic sites (epigenetic clock). Some large prospective studies showed that the acceleration of epigenetic aging as well as the shortening of telomeres were significantly associated with lymphopenia and poor outcome suggesting prognostic biomarkers in elderly COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, randomized clinical trials showed that statins, L-arginine, and resveratrol could mediate anti-inflammatory effectsviaindirect epigenetic interference and might improve COVID-19 outcome. Here, we discuss the epigenetic-sensitive events which might contribute to increase the risk of severity and mortality in older subjects and possible targeted therapies to counteract immunosenescence.© 2023 The Authors."
,37746266,Tissue-specific biological aging predicts progression in prostate cancer and acute myeloid leukemia.,Front Oncol,"Chronological aging is a well-recognized diagnostic and prognostic factor in multiple cancer types, yet the role of biological aging in manifesting cancer progression has not been fully explored yet.Given the central role of chronological aging in prostate cancer and AML incidence, here we investigate a tissue-specific role of biological aging in prostate cancer and AML progression. We have employed Cox proportional hazards modeling to associate biological aging genes with cancer progression for patients from specific chronological aging groups and for patients with differences in initial cancer aggressiveness.Our prostate cancer-specific investigations nominated four biological aging genes (CD44, GADD45B, STAT3, GFAP) significantly associated with time to disease progression in prostate cancer in Taylor et al. patient cohort. Stratified survival analysis on Taylor dataset and validation on an independent TCGA and DKFZ PRAD patient cohorts demonstrated ability of these genes to predict prostate cancer progression, especially for patients with higher Gleason score and for patients younger than 60 years of age. We have further tested the generalizability of our approach and applied it to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Our analysis nominated three AML-specific biological aging genes (CDC42EP2, CDC42, ALOX15B) significantly associated with time to AML overall survival, especially for patients with favorable cytogenetic risk score and for patients older than 56 years of age.Comparison of the identified PC and AML markers to genes selected at random and to known markers of progression demonstrated robustness of our results and nominated the identified biological aging genes as valuable markers of prostate cancer and AML progression, opening new avenues for personalized therapeutic management and potential novel treatment investigations.Copyright © 2023 Ramakrishnan, Datta, Panja, Patel, Liu, Craige, Chu, Jean-Marie, Oladoja, Kim and Mitrofanova."
,37686149,Circulating microRNAs as Potential Biomarkers in Pancreatic Cancer-Advances and Challenges.,Int J Mol Sci,"There is an urgent unmet need for robust and reliable biomarkers for early diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of response to specific treatments of many aggressive and deadly cancers, such as pancreatic cancer, and liquid biopsy-based miRNA profiling has the potential for this. MiRNAs are a subset of non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of a multitude of genes post-transcriptionally and thus are potential diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers and have also emerged as potential therapeutics. Because miRNAs are involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of their target mRNAs via repressing gene expression, defects in miRNA biogenesis pathway and miRNA expression perturb the expression of a multitude of oncogenic or tumor-suppressive genes that are involved in the pathogenesis of various cancers. As such, numerous miRNAs have been identified to be downregulated or upregulated in many cancers, functioning as either oncomes or oncosuppressor miRs. Moreover, dysregulation of miRNA biogenesis pathways can also change miRNA expression and function in cancer. Profiling of dysregulated miRNAs in pancreatic cancer has been shown to correlate with disease diagnosis, indicate optimal treatment options and predict response to a specific therapy. Specific miRNA signatures can track the stages of pancreatic cancer and hold potential as diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive markers, as well as therapeutics such as miRNA mimics and miRNA inhibitors (antagomirs). Furthermore, identified specific miRNAs and genes they regulate in pancreatic cancer along with downstream pathways can be used as potential therapeutic targets. However, a limited understanding and validation of the specific roles of miRNAs, lack of tissue specificity, methodological, technical, or analytical reproducibility, harmonization of miRNA isolation and quantification methods, the use of standard operating procedures, and the availability of automated and standardized assays to improve reproducibility between independent studies limit bench-to-bedside translation of the miRNA biomarkers for clinical applications. Here I review recent findings on miRNAs in pancreatic cancer pathogenesis and their potential as diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive markers."
,37714957,Imprinted genes and the manipulation of parenting in mammals.,Nat Rev Genet,"Genomic imprinting refers to the parent-of-origin expression of genes, which originates from epigenetic events in the mammalian germ line. The evolution of imprinting may reflect a conflict over resource allocation early in life, with silencing of paternal genes in offspring soliciting increased maternal provision and silencing of maternal genes limiting demands on the mother. Parental caregiving has been identified as an area of potential conflict, with several imprinted genes serendipitously found to directly influence the quality of maternal care. Recent systems biology approaches, based on single-cell RNA sequencing data, support a more deliberate relationship, which is reinforced by the finding that imprinted genes expressed in the offspring influence the quality of maternal caregiving. These bidirectional, reiterative relationships between parents and their offspring are critical both for short-term survival and for lifelong wellbeing, with clear implications for human health.© 2023.

,37901453,Robustness of quantifying mediating effects of genetically regulated expression on complex traits with mediated expression score regression.,Biol Methods Protoc,"Genetic association signals have been mostly found in noncoding regions through genome-wide association studies (GWAS), suggesting the roles of gene expression regulation in human diseases and traits. However, there has been limited success in colocalizing expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) with disease-associated variants. Mediated expression score regression (MESC) is a recently proposed method to quantify the proportion of trait heritability mediated by genetically regulated gene expressions (GReX). Applications of MESC to GWAS results have yielded low estimation of mediated heritability for many traits. As MESC relies on stringent independence assumptions betweencis-eQTL effects, gene effects, and nonmediated SNP effects, it may fail to characterize the true relationships between those effect sizes, which leads to biased results. Here, we consider the robustness of MESC to investigate whether the low fraction of mediated heritability inferred by MESC reflects biological reality for complex traits or is an underestimation caused by model misspecifications. Our results suggest that MESC may lead to biased estimates of mediated heritability with misspecification of gene annotations leading to underestimation, whereas misspecification of SNP annotations may lead to overestimation. Furthermore, errors in eQTL effect estimates may lead to underestimation of mediated heritability.© The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press."
,37857874,NA,NA,"The cerebral ventricles are recognized as windows into brain development and disease, yet their genetic architectures, underlying neural mechanisms and utility in maintaining brain health remain elusive. Here we aggregated genetic and neuroimaging data from 61,974 participants (age range, 9 to 98 years) in five cohorts to elucidate the genetic basis of ventricular morphology and examined their overlap with neuropsychiatric traits. Genome-wide association analysis in a discovery sample of 31,880 individuals identified 62 unique loci and 785 candidate genes associated with ventricular morphology. We replicated over 80% of loci in a well-matched cohort of lateral ventricular volume. Gene set analysis revealed enrichment of ventricular-trait-associated genes in biological processes and disease pathogenesis during both early brain development and degeneration. We explored the age-dependent genetic associations in cohorts of different age groups to investigate the possible roles of ventricular-trait-associated loci in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative processes. We describe the genetic overlap between ventricular and neuropsychiatric traits through comprehensive integrative approaches under correlative and causal assumptions. We propose the volume of the inferior lateral ventricles as a heritable endophenotype to predict the risk of Alzheimer's disease, which might be a consequence of prodromal Alzheimer's disease. Our study provides an advance in understanding the genetics of the cerebral ventricles and demonstrates the potential utility of ventricular measurements in tracking brain disorders and maintaining brain health across the lifespan.© 2023.

,37841863,The impact of blood MCP-1 levels on Alzheimer's disease with genetic variation of UNC5C and NAV3 loci.,Res Sq,"Previous study shows that monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), which is implicated in the peripheral proinflammatory cascade and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, modulates the genetic risks of AD in established AD loci.In this study, we hypothesized that blood MCP-1 impacts the AD risk of genetic variants beyond known AD loci. We thus performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using the logistic regression via generalized estimating equations (GEE) and the Cox proportional-hazards models to examine the interactive effects between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and blood MCP-1 level on AD in three cohorts: the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Religious Orders Study/Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP).We identified SNPs in two genes, neuron navigator 3 (NAV3, also named Unc-53 Homolog 3, rs696468) (p < 7.55×10- 9) and Unc-5 Netrin Receptor C (UNC5Crs72659964) (p < 1.07×10- 8) that showed an association between increasing levels of blood MCP-1 and AD. Elevating blood MCP-1 concentrations increased AD risk and AD pathology in genotypes ofNAV3(rs696468-CC) andUNC5C(rs72659964-AT + TT), but did not influence the other counterpart genotypes of these variants.NAV3andUNC5Care homologs and may increase AD risk through dysregulating the functions of neurite outgrowth and guidance. Overall, the association of risk alleles ofNAV3andUNC5Cwith AD is enhanced by peripheral MCP-1 level, suggesting that lowering the level of blood MCP-1 may reduce the risk of developing AD for people with these genotypes."
,37755483,Leveraging molecular quantitative trait loci to comprehend complex diseases/traits from the omics perspective.,Hum Genet,"Comprehending the molecular basis of quantitative genetic variation is a principal goal for complex diseases or traits. Molecular quantitative trait loci (molQTLs) have made it possible to investigate the effects of genetic variants hiding behind large-scale omics data. A deeper understanding of molQTL is urgently required in light of the multi-dimensionalization of omics data to more fully elucidate the pertinent biological mechanisms. Herein, we reviewed molQTLs with the corresponding resource from the omics perspective and further discussed the integrative strategy of GWAS-molQTL to infer their causal effects. Subsequently, we described the opportunities and challenges encountered by molQTL. The case studies showed that molQTL is essential for complex diseases and traits, whether single- or multi-omics QTLs. Overall, we highlighted the functional significance of genetic variants to employ the discovery of molQTL in complex diseases and traits.© 2023.

We are continuously updating the resource to further increase its utility for interpreting genetic associations with complex traits. Over the past two years, we have increased the number of uniformly processed studies from 21 to 31 and added X chromosome QTLs for 19 compatible studies. We have also implemented Leafcutter to directly identify splice-junction usage QTLs in all RNA sequencing datasets. Finally, to improve the interpretability of transcript-level QTLs, we have developed static QTL coverage plots that visualise the association between the genotype and average RNA sequencing read coverage in the region for all 1.7 million fine mapped associations. To illustrate the utility of these updates to the eQTL Catalogue, we performed colocalisation analysis between vitamin D levels in the UK Biobank and all molecular QTLs in the eQTL Catalogue. Although most GWAS loci colocalised both with eQTLs and transcript-level QTLs, we found that visual inspection could sometimes be used to distinguish primary splicing QTLs from those that appear to be secondary consequences of large-effect gene expression QTLs. While these visually confirmed primary splicing QTLs explain just 6/53 of the colocalising signals, they are significantly less pleiotropic than eQTLs and identify a prioritised causal gene in 4/6 cases.Copyright: © 2023 Kerimov et al.

,37764043,The Impact of Maternal Gut Microbiota during Pregnancy on Fetal Gut-Brain Axis Development and Life-Long Health Outcomes.,Microorganisms,"Gut microbiota plays a critical role in physiological regulation throughout life and is specifically modified to meet the demands of individual life stages and during pregnancy. Maternal gut microbiota is uniquely adapted to the pregnancy demands of the mother and the developing fetus. Both animal studies in pregnant germ-free rodents and human studies have supported a critical association between the composition of maternal microbiota during pregnancy and fetal development. Gut microbiota may also contribute to the development of the fetal gut-brain axis (GBA), which is increasingly recognized for its critical role in health and disease. Most studies consider birth as the time of GBA activation and focus on postnatal GBA development. This review focuses on GBA development during the prenatal period and the impact of maternal gut microbiota on fetal GBA development. It is hypothesized that adaptation of maternal gut microbiota to pregnancy is critical for the GBA prenatal development and maturation of GBA postnatally. Consequently, factors affecting maternal gut microbiota during pregnancy, such as maternal obesity, diet, stress and depression, infection, and medication, also affect fetal GBA development and are critical for GBA activity postnatally. Altered maternal gut microbiota during gestation has been shown to have long-term impact postnatally and multigenerational effects. Thus, understanding the impact of maternal gut microbiota during pregnancy on fetal GBA development is crucial for managing fetal, neonatal, and adult health, and should be included among public health priorities."
,37876194,Jaw size variation is associated with a novel craniofacial function for galanin receptor 2 in an adaptive radiation of pupfishes.,Proc Biol Sci,"Understanding the genetic basis of novel adaptations in new species is a fundamental question in biology. Here we demonstrate a new role for galr2 in vertebrate craniofacial development using an adaptive radiation of trophic specialist pupfishes endemic to San Salvador Island, Bahamas. We confirmed the loss of a putative Sry transcription factor binding site upstream of galr2 in scale-eating pupfish and found significant spatial differences in galr2 expression among pupfish species in Meckel's cartilage usingin situhybridization chain reaction (HCR). We then experimentally demonstrated a novel role for Galr2 in craniofacial development by exposing embryos to Garl2-inhibiting drugs. Galr2-inhibition reduced Meckel's cartilage length and increased chondrocyte density in both trophic specialists but not in the generalist genetic background. We propose a mechanism for jaw elongation in scale-eaters based on the reduced expression of galr2 due to the loss of a putative Sry binding site. Fewer Galr2 receptors in the scale-eater Meckel's cartilage may result in their enlarged jaw lengths as adults by limiting opportunities for a circulating Galr2 agonist to bind to these receptors during development. Our findings illustrate the growing utility of linking candidate adaptive SNPs in non-model systems with highly divergent phenotypes to novel vertebrate gene functions."
