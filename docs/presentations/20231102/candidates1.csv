,,No,20231102,prediction,37669030,Salivary Epigenetic Measures of Body Mass Index and Social Determinants of Health Across Childhood and Adolescence,JAMA Pediatr,"Children who are socioeconomically disadvantaged are at increased risk for high body mass index (BMI) and multiple diseases in adulthood. The developmental origins of health and disease hypothesis proposes that early life conditions affect later-life health in a manner that is only partially modifiable by later-life experiences.To examine whether epigenetic measures of BMI developed in adults are valid biomarkers of childhood BMI and if they are sensitive to early life social determinants of health.This population-based study of over 3200 children and adolescents aged 8 to 18 years included data from 2 demographically diverse US pediatric cohort studies that combine longitudinal and twin study designs. Analyses were conducted from 2021 to 2022.Socioeconomic status, marginalized groups.Salivary epigenetic BMI, BMI. Analyses were conducted to validate the use of saliva epigenetic BMI as a potential biomarker of child BMI and to examine associations between epigenetic BMI and social determinants of health.Salivary epigenetic BMI was calculated from 2 cohorts: (1) 1183 individuals aged 8 to 18 years (609 female [51%]; mean age, 13.4 years) from the Texas Twin Project and (2) 2020 children (1011 female [50%]) measured at 9 years of age and 15 years of age from the Future of Families and Child Well-Being Study. Salivary epigenetic BMI was associated with children's BMI (r = 0.36; 95% CI, 0.31-0.40 to r = 0.50; 95% CI, 0.42-0.59). Longitudinal analysis found that epigenetic BMI was highly stable across adolescence but remained both a leading and lagging indicator of BMI change. Twin analyses showed that epigenetic BMI captured differences in BMI between monozygotic twins. Moreover, children from more disadvantaged socioeconomic status (b = -0.13 to -0.15 across samples) and marginalized racial and ethnic groups (b = 0.08-0.34 across samples) had higher epigenetic BMI, even when controlling for concurrent BMI, pubertal development, and tobacco exposure. Socioeconomic status at birth relative to concurrent socioeconomic status best predicted epigenetic BMI in childhood and adolescence (b = -0.15; 95% CI, -0.20 to -0.09).This study demonstrated that epigenetic measures of BMI calculated from pediatric saliva samples were valid biomarkers of childhood BMI and may be associated with early-life social inequalities. The findings are in line with the hypothesis that early-life conditions are especially important factors in epigenetic regulation of later-life health. Research showing that health later in life is linked to early-life conditions has important implications for the development of early-life interventions that could significantly extend healthy life span."

Machine learning (ML)-based analytic techniques might help overcome the challenges of analyzing high-dimensional data in relatively small sample sizes. This systematic review summarizes the current use of ML-based methods in epigenome-wide studies for the identification of DNA methylation signatures associated with cancer prognosis.We searched three electronic databases including PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science for articles published until 2 January 2023. ML-based methods and workflows used to identify DNA methylation signatures associated with cancer prognosis were extracted and summarized. Two authors independently assessed the methodological quality of included studies by a seven-item checklist adapted from 'A Tool to Assess Risk of Bias and Applicability of Prediction Model Studies (PROBAST)' and from the 'Reporting Recommendations for Tumor Marker Prognostic Studies (REMARK). Different ML methods and workflows used in included studies were summarized and visualized by a sunburst chart, a bubble chart, and Sankey diagrams, respectively.Eighty-three studies were included in this review. Three major types of ML-based workflows were identified. 1) unsupervised clustering, 2) supervised feature selection, and 3) deep learning-based feature transformation. For the three workflows, the most frequently used ML techniques were consensus clustering, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and autoencoder, respectively. The systematic review revealed that the performance of these approaches has not been adequately evaluated yet and that methodological and reporting flaws were common in the identified studies using ML techniques.There is great heterogeneity in ML-based methodological strategies used by epigenome-wide studies to identify DNA methylation markers associated with cancer prognosis. In theory, most existing workflows could not handle the high multi-collinearity and potentially non-linearity interactions in epigenome-wide DNA methylation data. Benchmarking studies are needed to compare the relative performance of various approaches for specific cancer types. Adherence to relevant methodological and reporting guidelines are urgently needed.Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Using 1026 Qatar BioBank samples, epigenetics, whole genome sequencing and metabolomics were combined to further elucidate the biological mechanisms of T2D in a population with a high prevalence of T2D.An epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) with T2D was performed using the Infinium 850K EPIC array, followed by whole genome-wide sequencing SNP-CpG association analysis (> 5.5 million SNPs) and a methylome-metabolome (CpG-metabolite) analysis of the identified T2D sites.A total of 66 T2D-CpG associations were identified, including 63 novel sites in pathways of fructose and mannose metabolism, insulin signaling, galactose, starch and sucrose metabolism, and carbohydrate absorption and digestion. Whole genome SNP associations with the 66 CpGs resulted in 688 significant CpG-SNP associations comprising 22 unique CpGs (33% of the 66 CPGs) and included 181 novel pairs or pairs in novel loci. Fourteen of the loci overlapped published GWAS loci for diabetes related traits and were used to identify causal associations of HK1 and PFKFB2 with HbA1c. Methylome-metabolome analysis identified 66 significant CpG-metabolite pairs among which 61 pairs were novel. Using the identified methylome-metabolome associations, methylation QTLs, and metabolic networks, a multi-omics network was constructed which suggested a number of metabolic mechanisms underlying T2D methylated genes. 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-GPE (16:0/18:1) - a triglyceride-associated metabolite, shared a common network with 13 methylated CpGs, including TXNIP, PFKFB2, OCIAD1, and BLCAP. Mannonate - a food component/plant shared a common network with 6 methylated genes, including TXNIP, BLCAP, THBS4 and PEF1, pointing to a common possible cause of methylation in those genes. A subnetwork with alanine, glutamine, urea cycle (citrulline, arginine), and 1-carboxyethylvaline linked to PFKFB2 and TXNIP revealed associations with kidney function, hypertension and triglyceride metabolism. The pathway containing STYXL1-POR was associated with a sphingosine-ceramides subnetwork associated with HDL-C and LDL-C and point to steroid perturbations in T2D.This study revealed several novel methylated genes in T2D, with their genomic variants and associated metabolic pathways with several implications for future clinical use of multi-omics associations in disease and for studying therapeutic targets.© 2023.

,,No,20231102,dnamage,37690595,Accelerated epigenetic clock aging in maternal peripheral blood and preterm birth,Am J Obstet Gynecol,"Epigenetic clocks use CpG DNA methylation (DNAm) to estimate biologic age; acceleration is associated with cancer, heart disease, and shorter lifespan. Few studies evaluate DNAm age and pregnancy outcomes. AgeAccelGrim is a novel epigenetic clock that combines seven DNAm components.We sought to determine if maternal biologic aging (via AgeAccelGrim) is associated with early PTB.A prospective cohort of patients with singleton gestations and at high risk for spontaneous preterm birth (PTB) delivering at a tertiary University hospital were included in this study. Genome-wide CpG methylation was measured using the Illumina® EPIC BeadChip from maternal blood samples obtained <28 weeks' gestation. AgeAccelGrim and its seven DNAm components were estimated by the Horvath DNAm age online tool; positive values are associated with accelerated biologic aging whereas negative values are associated with slower biologic aging relative to each subject's age. The primary outcome was PTB <34 weeks (any indication); secondary outcomes were PTB <37 and <28 weeks. AgeAccelGrim was analyzed as a continuous variable and in quartiles; exploratory analyses evaluated each of the seven DNAm components included in the composite AgeAccelGrim. Data were analyzed by chi-square, t-test, rank-sum, logistic regression (controlling a priori for maternal age, cell counts, low socioeconomic status, and gestational age at time of sample collection), and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses; the log-rank test was used to test the equality of the survival functions.163 patients met inclusion criteria; 48% delivered <37, 39% <34, and 21% <28 weeks' gestation. The median AgeAccelGrim was -0.35 (IQR -2.24, 1.31) years for those delivering at term; those delivering preterm had higher AgeAccelGrim values that were inversely proportional to delivery gestational age [PTB <37 = +0.40 (IQR -1.21, +2.28) years; <34 = +0.51 (IQR -1.05, +2.67 years, and <28 = +1.05 (IQR -0.72, +2.72) years],. Estimated DNAm of the seven epigenetic clock components values were increased among those with PTB <34 weeks' gestation, although differences were only significant for DNAm of plasminogen activation inhibitor 1. In regression models, AgeAcccelGrim was associated with an elevated risk of PTB with increasing magnitude for increasing severity of PTB. For each one-year increase in AgeAccelGrim value (ie. each one-year increase in biologic age compared to chronologic age), the adjusted odds of PTB were 11% (aOR 1.11, 95% CI 1.00-1.24), 13% (aOR 1.13, 95% CI 1.01-1.26) and 18% (aOR 1.18, 95% CI 1.04-1.35) higher for PTB <37 weeks', <34 weeks' and <28 weeks' respectively. Similarly, individuals with accelerated biologic aging (≥75thpercentile AgeAccelGrim) had over double the odds of PTB <34 weeks' (aOR 2.36, 95% CI 1.10-5.08) and over triple the odds of PTB <28 weeks' (aOR 3.89, 95% CI 1.61-9.38). The adjusted odds ratio for PTB <37 weeks' gestation was 1.73, but spanned the null (aOR 1.73, 95% CI 0.81-3.69). In Kaplan-Meier survival analyses, those in the highest AgeAccelGrim quartile delivered earliest (log-rank p< 0.001).Accelerated biologic aging is associated with PTB among high-risk patients. Future research confirming these findings and elucidating factors that slow biologic aging may improve birth outcomes.Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier Inc."
,,No,20231102,dnamage,37693450,Self-control is associated with health-relevant disparities in buccal DNA-methylation measures of biological aging in older adults,medRxiv,"Self-control is a personality dimension that is associated with better physical health and a longer lifespan. Here we examined (1) whether self-control is associated with buccal and saliva DNA-methylation (DNAm) measures of biological aging quantified in children, adolescents, and adults, and (2) whether biological aging measured in buccal DNAm is associated with self-reported health. Following preregistered analyses, we computed two DNAm measures of advanced biological age (PhenoAge and GrimAge Acceleration) and a DNAm measure of pace of aging (DunedinPACE) in buccal samples from the German Socioeconomic Panel Study (SOEP-G[ene],n= 1058, age range 0-72,Mage= 42.65) and saliva samples from the Texas Twin Project (TTP,n= 1327, age range 8-20,Mage= 13.50). We found that lower self-control was associated with advanced biological age in older adults (β=-.34), but not young adults, adolescents or children. This association was not accounted for by statistical correction for socioeconomic contexts, BMI, or genetic correlates of low self-control. Moreover, a faster pace of aging and advanced biological age measured in buccal DNAm were associated with worse self-reported health (β=.13 toβ= .19). But, effect sizes were weaker than observations in blood, thus customization of DNAm aging measures to buccal and saliva tissues may be necessary. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that self-control is associated with health via pathways that accelerate biological aging in older adults."
,,Yes,20231102,ewas,37696874,A higher dysregulation burden of brain DNA methylation in female patients implicated in the sex bias of Schizophrenia,Mol Psychiatry,"Sex differences are pervasive in schizophrenia (SCZ), but the extent and magnitude of DNA methylation (DNAm) changes underlying these differences remain uncharacterized. In this study, sex-stratified differential DNAm analysis was performed in postmortem brain samples from 117 SCZ and 137 controls, partitioned into discovery and replication datasets. Three differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were identified (adj.p < 0.05) in females and 29 DMPs in males without overlap between them. Over 81% of these sex-stratified DMPs were directionally consistent between sexes but with different effect sizes. Females experienced larger magnitude of DNAm changes and more DMPs (based on data of equal sample size) than males, contributing to a higher dysregulation burden of DNAm in females SCZ. Additionally, despite similar proportions of female-related DMPs (fDMPs, 8%) being under genetic control compared with males (10%), significant enrichment of DMP-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in signals of genome-wide association studies was identified only in fDMPs. One DMP in each sex connected the SNPs and gene expression of CALHM1 in females and CCDC149 in males. PPI subnetworks revealed that both female- and male-related differential DNAm interacted with synapse-related dysregulation. Immune-related pathways were unique for females and neuron-related pathways were associated with males. This study reveals remarkable quantitative differences in DNAm-related sexual dimorphism in SCZ and that females have a higher dysregulation burden of SCZ-associated DNAm than males.© 2023.

,,Yes,20231102,ewas,37697338,Analysis of DNA methylation at birth and in childhood reveals changes associated with season of birth and latitude,Clin Epigenetics,"Seasonal variations in environmental exposures at birth or during gestation are associated with numerous adult traits and health outcomes later in life. Whether DNA methylation (DNAm) plays a role in the molecular mechanisms underlying the associations between birth season and lifelong phenotypes remains unclear.We carried out epigenome-wide meta-analyses within the Pregnancy And Childhood Epigenetic Consortium to identify associations of DNAm with birth season, both at differentially methylated probes (DMPs) and regions (DMRs). Associations were examined at two time points: at birth (21 cohorts, N = 9358) and in children aged 1-11 years (12 cohorts, N = 3610). We conducted meta-analyses to assess the impact of latitude on birth season-specific associations at both time points.We identified associations between birth season and DNAm (False Discovery Rate-adjusted p values < 0.05) at two CpGs at birth (winter-born) and four in the childhood (summer-born) analyses when compared to children born in autumn. Furthermore, we identified twenty-six differentially methylated regions (DMR) at birth (winter-born: 8, spring-born: 15, summer-born: 3) and thirty-two in childhood (winter-born: 12, spring and summer: 10 each) meta-analyses with few overlapping DMRs between the birth seasons or the two time points. The DMRs were associated with genes of known functions in tumorigenesis, psychiatric/neurological disorders, inflammation, or immunity, amongst others. Latitude-stratified meta-analyses [higher (≥ 50°N), lower (< 50°N, northern hemisphere only)] revealed differences in associations between birth season and DNAm by birth latitude. DMR analysis implicated genes with previously reported links to schizophrenia (LAX1), skin disorders (PSORS1C, LTB4R), and airway inflammation including asthma (LTB4R), present only at birth in the higher latitudes (≥ 50°N).In this large epigenome-wide meta-analysis study, we provide evidence for (i) associations between DNAm and season of birth that are unique for the seasons of the year (temporal effect) and (ii) latitude-dependent variations in the seasonal associations (spatial effect). DNAm could play a role in the molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of birth season on adult health outcomes.© 2023. BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature."
x,focus on invariable sites,No,20231102,methods,37702598,"Fail-tests of DNA methylation clocks, and development of a noise barometer for measuring epigenetic pressure of aging and disease",Aging (Albany NY),"This study shows that Elastic Net (EN) DNA methylation (DNAme) clocks have low accuracy of predictions for individuals of the same age and a low resolution between healthy and disease cohorts; caveats inherent in applying linear model to non-linear processes. We found that change in methylation of cytosines with age is, interestingly, not the determinant for their selection into the clocks. Moreover, an EN clock's selected cytosines change when non-clock cytosines are removed from the training data; as expected from optimization in a machine learning (ML) context, but inconsistently with the identification of health markers in a biological context. To address these limitations, we moved from predictions to measurement of biological age, focusing on the cytosines that on average remain invariable in their methylation through lifespan, postulated to be homeostatically vital. We established that dysregulation of such cytosines, measured as the sums of standard deviations of their methylation values, quantifies biological noise, which in our hypothesis is a biomarker of aging and disease. We term this approach a ""noise barometer"" - the pressure of aging and disease on an organism. These noise-detecting cytosines are particularly important as sums of SD on the entire 450K DNAme array data yield a random pattern through chronology. Testing how many cytosines of the 450K arrays become noisier with age, we found that the paradigm of DNAme noise as a biomarker of aging and disease remarkably manifests in ~1/4 of the total. In that large set even the cytosines that have on average constant methylation through age show increased SDs and can be used as noise detectors of the barometer."
,,No,20231102,tandem repeats,37709751,A landscape of complex tandem repeats within individual human genomes,Nat Commun,"Markedly expanded tandem repeats (TRs) have been correlated with ~60 diseases. TR diversity has been considered a clue toward understanding missing heritability. However, haplotype-resolved long TRs remain mostly hidden or blacked out because their complex structures (TRs composed of various units and minisatellites containing >10-bp units) make them difficult to determine accurately with existing methods. Here, using a high-precision algorithm to determine complex TR structures from long, accurate reads of PacBio HiFi, an investigation of 270 Japanese control samples yields several genome-wide findings. Approximately 322,000 TRs are difficult to impute from the surrounding single-nucleotide variants. Greater genetic divergence of TR loci is significantly correlated with more events of younger replication slippage. Complex TRs are more abundant than single-unit TRs, and a tendency for complex TRs to consist of <10-bp units and single-unit TRs to be minisatellites is statistically significant at loci with ≥500-bp TRs. Of note, 8909 loci with extended TRs (>100b longer than the mode) contain several known disease-associated TRs and are considered candidates for association with disorders. Overall, complex TRs and minisatellites are found to be abundant and diverse, even in genetically small Japanese populations, yielding insights into the landscape of long TRs.© 2023.

Previous published PACs were constructed either in smaller studies or mainly in White individuals, and they used proteomic measures from only one-time point. In the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study of about 12,000 persons followed for 30 years (around 75% White, 25% Black), we created de novo PACs and compared their performance to published PACs at two different time points. We measured 4,712 plasma proteins by SomaScan in 11,761 midlife participants, aged 46-70 years (1990-92), and 5,183 late-life pariticpants, aged 66-90 years (2011-13). All proteins were log2-transformed to correct for skewness. We created de novo PACs by training them against chronological age using elastic net regression in two-thirds of healthy participants in midlife and late life and compared their performance to three published PACs. We estimated age acceleration (by regressing each PAC on chronological age) and its change from midlife to late life. We examined their associations with mortality from all-cause, cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, and lower respiratory disease (LRD) using Cox proportional hazards regression in all remaining participants irrespective of health. The model was adjusted for chronological age, smoking, body mass index (BMI), and other confounders. The ARIC PACs had a slightly stronger correlation with chronological age than published PACs in healthy participants at each time point. Associations with mortality were similar for the ARIC and published PACs. For late-life and midlife age acceleration for the ARIC PACs, respectively, hazard ratios (HRs) per one standard deviation were 1.65 and 1.38 (both p<0.001) for all-cause mortality, 1.37 and 1.20 (both p<0.001) for CVD mortality, 1.21 (p=0.03) and 1.04 (p=0.19) for cancer mortality, and 1.46 and 1.68 (both p<0.001) for LRD mortality. For the change in age acceleration, HRs for all-cause, CVD, and LRD mortality were comparable to those observed for late-life age acceleration. The association between the change in age acceleration and cancer mortality was insignificant. In this prospective study, the ARIC and published PACs were similarly associated with an increased risk of mortality and advanced testing in relation to various age-related conditions in future studies is suggested."
,,No,20231102,dnamage,37732266,A blood biomarker of accelerated aging in the body associates with worse structural integrity in the brain: replication across three cohorts,medRxiv,"Biological aging is the correlated decline of multi-organ system integrity central to the etiology of many age-related diseases. A novel epigenetic measure of biological aging, DunedinPACE, is associated with cognitive dysfunction, incident dementia, and mortality. Here, we tested for associations between DunedinPACE and structural MRI phenotypes in three datasets spanning midlife to advanced age: the Dunedin Study (age=45 years), the Framingham Heart Study Offspring Cohort (mean age=63 years), and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (mean age=75 years). We also tested four additional epigenetic measures of aging: the Horvath clock, the Hannum clock, PhenoAge, and GrimAge. Across all datasets (total N observations=3,380; total N individuals=2,322), faster DunedinPACE was associated with lower total brain volume, lower hippocampal volume, and thinner cortex. In two datasets, faster DunedinPACE was associated with greater burden of white matter hyperintensities. Across all measures, DunedinPACE and GrimAge had the strongest and most consistent associations with brain phenotypes. Our findings suggest that single timepoint measures of multi-organ decline such as DunedinPACE could be useful for gauging nervous system health."

We recently reported that greater polyphenol intake benefitted ectopic fats, brain function, and gut microbiota profile, corresponding with elevated urine polyphenols. The effect of polyphenol-rich dietary interventions on biological aging is yet to be determined.We calculated different biological aging epigenetic clocks of different generations (Horvath2013, Hannum2013, Li2018, Horvath skin and blood2018, PhenoAge2018, PCGrimAge2022), their corresponding age and intrinsic age accelerations, and DunedinPACE, all based on DNA methylation (Illumina EPIC array; pre-specified secondary outcome) for 256 participants with abdominal obesity or dyslipidemia, before and after the 18-month DIRECT PLUS randomized controlled trial. Three interventions were assigned: healthy dietary guidelines, a Mediterranean (MED) diet, and a polyphenol-rich, low-red/processed meat Green-MED diet. Both MED groups consumed 28 g walnuts/day (+ 440 mg/day polyphenols). The Green-MED group consumed green tea (3-4 cups/day) and Mankai (Wolffia globosa strain) 500-ml green shake (+ 800 mg/day polyphenols). Adherence to the Green-MED diet was assessed by questionnaire and urine polyphenols metabolomics (high-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight).Baseline chronological age (51.3 ± 10.6 years) was significantly correlated with all methylation age (mAge) clocks with correlations ranging from 0.83 to 0.95; p < 2.2e - 16 for all. While all interventions did not differ in terms of changes between mAge clocks, greater Green-Med diet adherence was associated with a lower 18-month relative change (i.e., greater mAge attenuation) in Li and Hannum mAge (beta =  - 0.41, p = 0.004 and beta =  - 0.38, p = 0.03, respectively; multivariate models). Greater Li mAge attenuation (multivariate models adjusted for age, sex, baseline mAge, and weight loss) was mostly affected by higher intake of Mankai (beta =  - 1.8; p = 0.061) and green tea (beta =  - 1.57; p = 0.0016) and corresponded with elevated urine polyphenols: hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, and urolithin C (p < 0.05 for all) and urolithin A (p = 0.08), highly common in green plants. Overall, participants undergoing either MED-style diet had ~ 8.9 months favorable difference between the observed and expected Li mAge at the end of the intervention (p = 0.02).This study showed that MED and green-MED diets with increased polyphenols intake, such as green tea and Mankai, are inversely associated with biological aging. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first clinical trial to indicate a potential link between polyphenol intake, urine polyphenols, and biological aging.ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03020186.© 2023.

Current clocks are mostly based on linear models and rely upon hundreds of sites across the genome. Here, we present GP-age, an epigenetic non-linear cohort-based clock for blood, based upon 11,910 methylomes. Using 30 CpG sites alone, GP-age outperforms state-of-the-art models, with a median accuracy of ∼2 years on held-out blood samples, for both array and sequencing-based data. We show that aging-related changes occur at multiple neighboring CpGs, with implications for using fragment-level analysis of sequencing data in aging research. By training three independent clocks, we show enrichment of donors with consistent deviation between predicted and actual age, suggesting individual rates of biological aging. Overall, we provide a compact yet accurate alternative to array-based clocks for blood, with applications in longitudinal aging research, forensic profiling, and monitoring epigenetic processes in transplantation medicine and cancer.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

However, integrative profiling of cfDNA methylome and fragmentome has been technologically challenging. Here, we adapt an enzyme-mediated methylation sequencing method for comprehensive analysis of genome-wide cfDNA methylation, fragmentation, and copy number alteration (CNA) characteristics for enhanced cancer detection. We apply this method to plasma samples of 497 healthy controls and 780 patients of seven cancer types and develop an ensemble classifier by incorporating methylation, fragmentation, and CNA features. In the test cohort, our approach achieves an area under the curve value of 0.966 for overall cancer detection. Detection sensitivity for early-stage patients achieves 73% at 99% specificity. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility to accurately localize the origin of cancer signals with combined methylation and fragmentation profiling of tissue-specific accessible chromatin regions.

,,No,20231102,dnamage,37770973,Effect of women's fertility and sexual development on epigenetic clock: Mendelian randomization study,Clin Epigenetics,"In observational studies, women's fertility and sexual development traits may have implications for DNA methylation patterns, and pregnancy-related risk factors can also affect maternal DNA methylation patterns. The aim of our study is to disentangle any potential causal associations between women's fertility and sexual development traits and epigenetic clocks, as well as to search for probable mediators by using the Mendelian randomization (MR) method.Instrumental variables for exposures, mediators, and outcomes were adopted from genome-wide association studies data of European ancestry individuals. The potential causal relationship between women's fertility and sexual development traits and four epigenetic clocks were evaluated by inverse variance weighted method and verified by other two methods. Furthermore, we employed multivariable MR (MVMR) adjusting for hypertension, hyperglycemia, BMI changes, and insomnia. Then, combining the MVMR results and previous research, we performed two-step MR to explore the mediating effects of BMI, AFS, and AFB. Multiple sensitivity analyses were further performed to verify the robustness of our findings.Leveraging two-sample MR analysis, we observed statistically significant associations between earlier age at first birth (AFB) with a higher HannumAge, PhenoAge and GrimAge acceleration(β = - 0.429, 95% CI [- 0.781 to - 0.077], p = 0.017 for HannumAge; β = - 0.571, 95% CI [- 1.006 to - 0.136], p = 0.010 for PhenoAge, and β = - 1.136, 95% CI [- 1.508 to - 0.765], p = 2.03E-09 for GrimAge respectively) and age at first sexual intercourse (AFS) with a higher HannumAge and GrimAge acceleration(β = - 0.175, 95% CI [- 0.336 to - 0.014], p = 0.033 for HannumAge; β = - 0.210, 95% CI [- 0.350 to - 0.070], p = 0.003 for GrimAge, respectively). Further analyses indicated that BMI, AFB and AFS played mediator roles in the path from women's fertility and sexual development traits to epigenetic aging.Our study suggested that AFS and AFB are associated with epigenetic aging. These findings may prove valuable in informing the development of prevention strategies and interventions targeted towards women's fertility and sexual development experiences and their relationship with epigenetic aging-related diseases.© 2023.

The vast majority of studies use chemical conversion to analyse bulk-level patterns of DNA methylation across the genome from a population of cells. While this technology has been used to probe single-molecule methylation patterns, such analyses are limited to short reads of a few hundred basepairs. DNA methylation can also be directly detected using Nanopore sequencing which can generate reads measuring megabases in length. However, thus far these analyses have largely focused on bulk-level assessment of DNA methylation. Here, we analyse DNA methylation in single Nanopore reads from human lymphoblastoid cells, to show that bulk-level metrics underestimate large-scale heterogeneity in the methylome. We use the correlation in methylation state between neighbouring sites to quantify single-molecule heterogeneity and find that heterogeneity varies significantly across the human genome, with some regions having heterogeneous methylation patterns at the single-molecule level and others possessing more homogeneous methylation patterns. By comparing the genomic distribution of the correlation to epigenomic annotations, we find that the greatest heterogeneity in single-molecule patterns is observed within heterochromatic partially methylated domains (PMDs). In contrast, reads originating from euchromatic regions and gene bodies have more ordered DNA methylation patterns. By analysing the patterns of single molecules in more detail, we show the existence of a nucleosome-scale periodicity in DNA methylation that accounts for some of the heterogeneity we uncover in long single-molecule DNA methylation patterns. We find that this periodic structure is partially masked in bulk data and correlates with DNA accessibility as measured by nanoNOMe-seq, suggesting that it could be generated by nucleosomes. Our findings demonstrate the power of single-molecule analysis of long-read data to understand the structure of the human methylome.Copyright: © 2023 Kerr et al.

,,No,20231102,dnamage,37786333,Intersection clock reveals a rejuvenation event during human embryogenesis,Aging Cell,"Recent research revealed a rejuvenation event during early development of mice. Here, by examining epigenetic age dynamics of human embryogenesis, we tested whether a similar event exists in humans. For this purpose, we developed an epigenetic clock method, the intersection clock, that utilizes bisulfite sequencing in a way that maximizes the use of informative CpG sites with no missing clock CpG sites in test samples and applied it to human embryo development data. We observed no changes in the predicted epigenetic age between cleavage stage and blastocyst stage embryos; however, a significant decrease was observed between blastocysts and cells representing the epiblast. Additionally, by applying the intersection clock to datasets spanning pre and postimplantation, we found no significant change in the epigenetic age during preimplantation stages; however, the epigenetic age of postimplantation samples was lower compared to the preimplantation stages. We further investigated the epigenetic age of primed (representing early postimplantation) and naïve (representing preimplantation) pluripotent stem cells and observed that in all cases the epigenetic age of primed cells was significantly lower than that of naïve cells. Together, our data suggest that human embryos are rejuvenated during early embryogenesis. Hence, the rejuvenation event is conserved between the mouse and human, and it occurs around the gastrulation stage in both species. Beyond this advance, the intersection clock opens the way for other epigenetic age studies based on human bisulfite sequencing datasets as opposed to methylation arrays.© 2023 The Authors.

,,No,20231102,dnamage,37787856,Application of a mathematical model to clarify the statistical characteristics of a pan-tissue DNA methylation clock,Geroscience,"DNA methylation clocks estimate biological age based on DNA methylation profiles. This study developed a mathematical model to describe DNA methylation aging and the establishment of a pan-tissue DNA methylation clock. The model simulates the aging dynamics of DNA methylation profiles based on passive demethylation as well as the process of cross-sectional bulk data acquisition. As a result, this study identified two conditions under which the pan-tissue DNA methylation clock can successfully predict biological age: one condition is that the target tissues are sufficiently well represented in the training dataset, and the other condition is that the target sample contains cell subsets that are common among different tissues. When either of these conditions is met, the clock performs well. It is also suggested that the epigenetic age of all samples in the target tissue tends to be either over or underestimated when biological age prediction fails. The model can reveal the statistical characteristics of DNA methylation clocks.© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to American Aging Association."

Smoking is heritable, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of smoking behaviors have identified hundreds of significant loci. Most GWAS-identified variants are noncoding with unknown neurobiological effects. We used genome-wide genotype, DNA methylation, and RNA sequencing data in postmortem human nucleus accumbens (NAc) to identify cis-methylation/expression quantitative trait loci (meQTLs/eQTLs), investigate variant-by-cigarette smoking interactions across the genome, and overlay QTL evidence at smoking GWAS-identified loci to evaluate their regulatory potential. Active smokers (N=52) and nonsmokers (N=171) were defined based on cotinine biomarker levels and next-of-kin reporting. We simultaneously tested variant and variant-by-smoking interaction effects on methylation and expression, separately, adjusting for biological and technical covariates and using a two-stage multiple testing approach with eigenMT and Bonferroni corrections. We found >2 million significant meQTL variants (padj<0.05) corresponding to 41,695 unique CpGs. Results were largely driven by main effects; five meQTLs, mapping toNUDT12,FAM53B,RNF39, andADRA1B, showed a significant interaction with smoking. We found 57,683 significant eQTLs for 958 unique eGenes (padj<0.05) and no smoking interactions. Colocalization analyses identified loci with smoking-associated GWAS variants that overlapped meQTLs/eQTLs, suggesting that these heritable factors may influence smoking behaviors through functional effects on methylation/expression. One locus containingMUSTIN1andITIH4colocalized across all data types (GWAS + meQTL + eQTL). In this first genome-wide meQTL map in the human NAc, the enriched overlap with smoking GWAS-identified genetic loci provides evidence that gene regulation in the brain helps explain the neurobiology of smoking behaviors."

The CNTR conducted epidemiological investigations and blood withdrawal twice in 2013 and 2018. These included twins were used to perform epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) and to validate the previously reported PD-associated CpGs selected from previous EWASs in PubMed, Embase, and the EWAS catalog. Next, a cross-lagged study was performed to examine the temporality between changes in DNAm and PD in 308 twins who completed both 2013 and 2018 surveys.The EWAS analysis of our study identified 25 CpGs. In the validation analysis, 741 CpGs from 29 previous EWASs on PD were selected for validation, and 101 CpGs were validated to be significant at a false discovery rate <0.05. The cross-lagged analysis found a unidirectional path from PD to DNAm at 14 CpGs, while no sites showed significance from DNAm to PD.This study identified and validated PD-related CpGs in a Chinese twin population, and suggested that PD may be the cause of changes in DNAm over time.

Our aim was to identify Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine (CpG) dinucleotides associated with diet quality by conducting an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) based on blood DNA methylation (DNAm), and to assess how diet-related CpGs associate with inherited susceptibility to cardiometabolic traits: body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure (SBP), triglycerides, type 2 diabetes (T2D) and coronary heart disease (CHD).Meta-EWAS including 5,274 participants in four cohorts from Spain, the US and the UK. We derived three dietary scores (exposures) to measure adherence to a Mediterranean diet (MMDS), to a healthy plant-based diet (HPDI) and to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH). Blood DNAm (outcome) was assessed with the Infinium arrays Human Methylation 450 K BeadChip and MethylationEPIC BeadChip. For each diet score, we performed linear EWAS adjusted for age, sex, blood cells, smoking and technical variables, and BMI in a second set of models. We also conducted Mendelian randomization analyses to assess the potential causal relationship between diet-related CpGs and cardiometabolic traits.We found 18 differentially methylated CpGs associated with dietary scores (p-value < 1.08 × 10-7; Bonferroni correction), of which 12 were previously associated with cardiometabolic traits. Enrichment analysis revealed overrepresentation of diet-associated genes in pathways involved in inflammation and cardiovascular disease. Mendelian randomization analyses suggested that genetically determined methylation levels corresponding to lower diet quality at cg02079413 (SNORA54), cg02107842 (MAST4), and cg23761815 (SLC29A3) were causally associated with higher BMI, and at cg05399785 (WDR8) with greater SBP; and methylation levels associated with higher diet quality at cg00711496 (PRMT1) with lower BMI, T2D risk and CHD risk, and at cg0557921 (AHRR) with lower CHD risk.Diet quality in adults was related to differential methylation in blood at 18 CpGs, some of which related to cardiometabolic health.Availability: The R code for the analysis is available in the following Github repository: https://github.com/jorgedb98/B64_DIAMETR.git.© The Author(s) 2023.

,,Yes,20231102,ewas,37794499,The application of epiphenotyping approaches to DNA methylation array studies of the human placenta,Epigenetics Chromatin,"Genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAme) profiling of the placenta with Illumina Infinium Methylation bead arrays is often used to explore the connections between in utero exposures, placental pathology, and fetal development. However, many technical and biological factors can lead to signals of DNAme variation between samples and between cohorts, and understanding and accounting for these factors is essential to ensure meaningful and replicable data analysis. Recently, ""epiphenotyping"" approaches have been developed whereby DNAme data can be used to impute information about phenotypic variables such as gestational age, sex, cell composition, and ancestry. These epiphenotypes offer avenues to compare phenotypic data across cohorts, and to understand how phenotypic variables relate to DNAme variability. However, the relationships between placental epiphenotyping variables and other technical and biological variables, and their application to downstream epigenome analyses, have not been well studied.Using DNAme data from 204 placentas across three cohorts, we applied the PlaNET R package to estimate epiphenotypes gestational age, ancestry, and cell composition in these samples. PlaNET ancestry estimates were highly correlated with independent polymorphic ancestry-informative markers, and epigenetic gestational age, on average, was estimated within 4 days of reported gestational age, underscoring the accuracy of these tools. Cell composition estimates varied both within and between cohorts, as well as over very long placental processing times. Interestingly, the ratio of cytotrophoblast to syncytiotrophoblast proportion decreased with increasing gestational age, and differed slightly by both maternal ethnicity (lower in white vs. non-white) and genetic ancestry (lower in higher probability European ancestry). The cohort of origin and cytotrophoblast proportion were the largest drivers of DNAme variation in this dataset, based on their associations with the first principal component.This work confirms that cohort, array (technical) batch, cell type proportion, self-reported ethnicity, genetic ancestry, and biological sex are important variables to consider in any analyses of Illumina DNAme data. We further demonstrate the specific utility of epiphenotyping tools developed for use with placental DNAme data, and show that these variables (i) provide an independent check of clinically obtained data and (ii) provide a robust approach to compare variables across different datasets. Finally, we present a general framework for the processing and analysis of placental DNAme data, integrating the epiphenotype variables discussed here.© 2023.

Nevertheless, most current screening programs suffer from low participation rates. A blood test may improve both the adherence to screening and the selection to colonoscopy. In this study, we conducted a serum-based discovery and validation of cfDNA methylation biomarkers for CRC screening in a multicenter cohort of 433 serum samples including healthy controls, benign pathologies, advanced adenomas (AA), and CRC.First, we performed an epigenome-wide methylation analysis with the MethylationEPIC array using a sample pooling approach, followed by a robust prioritization of candidate biomarkers for the detection of advanced neoplasia (AN: AA and CRC). Then, candidate biomarkers were validated by pyrosequencing in independent individual cfDNA samples. We report GALNT9, UPF3A, WARS, and LDB2 as new noninvasive biomarkers for the early detection of AN. The combination of GALNT9/UPF3A by logistic regression discriminated AN with 78.8% sensitivity and 100% specificity, outperforming the commonly used fecal immunochemical test and the methylated SEPT9 blood test.Overall, this study highlights the utility of cfDNA methylation for CRC screening. Our results suggest that the combination methylated GALNT9/UPF3A has the potential to serve as a highly specific and sensitive blood-based test for screening and early detection of CRC.© 2023.

Previous studies have disclosed the association between radiation exposure and increased double-strand breaks (DSBs) and changes in DNA methylation. However, whether the induced DSBs by CT examination recover within 24h and whether a CT examination induces detectable gene-specific methylation changes are still unclear. The aim of the present study was to analyze γ-H2AX in the peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) of healthy adults before and after CT examination and to discover the differentially methylated positions (DMPs) along with an analysis of DNA methylation changes caused by CT examination.Peripheral blood samples of 4 ml were drawn from 20 healthy volunteers at three time points: before CT examination, after CT examination 1h, and after CT examination 24h. γ-H2AX immunofluorescence and Illumina Infinium Human Methylation EPIC BeadChip (850k BeadChip) were used respectively for the test of DSBs and the epigenome-wide DNA methylation analysis. Linear mixed-effect (LME) models were used to evaluate the impacts of doses represented by different parameters and foci on genome-wide DNA methylation.The number of γ-H2AX foci per cell at 1h showed linear dose-responses for the radiation doses represented by CT index volume (CTDIvol), dose length product (DLP), and blood absorbed dose, respectively. Residual γ-H2AX foci was observed after CT examination at 24h (p < .001). DMPs and γ-H2AX foci changes could be found within 1h. One CpG site related to PAX5 was significantly changed by using most of the parameters in LME models and did not recover till 24h.Residual γ-H2AX foci exist after CT examination at 24h. The DNA methylation changes induced by CT examination may not recover within 24h. The DNA methylation had been changed as early as at 1h. The PAX5-related CpG site may be a potential biomarker of low-dose radiation.The biological effects and the cancer risks of CT examination are still unclear. The present study is an effort to document the CT scan-induced events in 24h in vivo. The CT scanning area should be strictly limited, and non-essential repeated operations shouldn't be performed within 24h."

To address these challenges, published assays to date demanded a very high-depth sequencing, resulting in an elevated price of test. Herein, we developed a multimodal assay called SPOT-MAS (screening for the presence of tumor by methylation and size) to simultaneously profile methylomics, fragmentomics, copy number, and end motifs in a single workflow using targeted and shallow genome-wide sequencing (~0.55×) of cell-free DNA. We applied SPOT-MAS to 738 non-metastatic patients with breast, colorectal, gastric, lung, and liver cancer, and 1550 healthy controls. We then employed machine learning to extract multiple cancer and tissue-specific signatures for detecting and locating cancer. SPOT-MAS successfully detected the five cancer types with a sensitivity of 72.4% at 97.0% specificity. The sensitivities for detecting early-stage cancers were 73.9% and 62.3% for stages I and II, respectively, increasing to 88.3% for non-metastatic stage IIIA. For tumor-of-origin, our assay achieved an accuracy of 0.7. Our study demonstrates comparable performance to other ctDNA-based assays while requiring significantly lower sequencing depth, making it economically feasible for population-wide screening.© 2023, Nguyen, Nguyen et al."

,,Yes,20231102,ewas,37844693,An epigenome-wide association study of child appetitive traits and DNA methylation,Appetite,"The etiology of childhood appetitive traits is poorly understood. Early-life epigenetic processes may be involved in the developmental programming of appetite regulation in childhood. One such process is DNA methylation (DNAm), whereby a methyl group is added to a specific part of DNA, where a cytosine base is next to a guanine base, a CpG site. We meta-analyzed epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) of cord blood DNAm and early-childhood appetitive traits. Data were from two independent cohorts: the Generation R Study (n = 1,086, Rotterdam, the Netherlands) and the Healthy Start study (n = 236, Colorado, USA). DNAm at autosomal methylation sites in cord blood was measured using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Parents reported on their child's food responsiveness, emotional undereating, satiety responsiveness and food fussiness using the Children's Eating Behaviour Questionnaire at age 4-5 years. Multiple regression models were used to examine the association of DNAm (predictor) at the individual site- and regional-level (using DMRff) with each appetitive trait (outcome), adjusting for covariates. Bonferroni-correction was applied to adjust for multiple testing. There were no associations of DNAm and any appetitive trait when examining individual CpG-sites. However, when examining multiple CpGs jointly in so-called differentially methylated regions, we identified 45 associations of DNAm with food responsiveness, 7 associations of DNAm with emotional undereating, 13 associations of DNAm with satiety responsiveness, and 9 associations of DNAm with food fussiness. This study shows that DNAm in the newborn may partially explain variation in appetitive traits expressed in early childhood and provides preliminary support for early programming of child appetitive traits through DNAm. Investigating differential DNAm associated with appetitive traits could be an important first step in identifying biological pathways underlying the development of these behaviors.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

Psychosocial stressors may also have intergenerational health effects by which parental ACEs are associated with mental and physical health of children. Epigenetic programming may be one mechanism linking parental ACEs to child health. This study aimed to investigate epigenome-wide associations of maternal preconception ACEs with DNA methylation patterns of children. In the Center for the Health Assessment of Mothers and Children of Salinas study, cord blood DNA methylation was measured using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Preconception ACEs, which occurred during the mothers' childhoods, were collected using a standard ACE questionnaire including 10 ACE indicators. Maternal ACE exposures were defined in this study as (1) the total number of ACEs; (2) the total number of ACEs categorized as 0, 1-3, and > 4; and (3) individual ACEs. Associations of ACE exposures with differential methylated positions, regions, and CpG modules determined using weighted gene co-expression network analysis were evaluated adjusting for covariates.Data on maternal ACEs and cord blood DNA methylation were available for 196 mother/newborn pairs. One differential methylated position was associated with maternal experience of emotional abuse (cg05486260/FAM135B gene; q value < 0.05). Five differential methylated regions were significantly associated with the total number of ACEs, and 36 unique differential methylated regions were associated with individual ACEs (Šidák p value < 0.05). Fifteen CpG modules were significantly correlated with the total number of ACEs or individual ACEs, of which 8 remained significant in fully adjusted models (p value < 0.05). Significant modules were enriched for pathways related to neurological and immune development and function.Maternal ACEs prior to conception were associated with cord blood DNA methylation of offspring at birth. Although there was limited overlap between differential methylated regions and CpGs in modules associated with ACE exposures, statistically significant regions and networks were related to genes involved in neurological and immune function.

Epigenome-wide association analysis identified one genome-wide significant CpG (cg20711926-CYP1B1) associated with aortic augmentation index (AIx). Follow-up analyses, including gene set enrichment analysis, expression quantitative trait methylation analysis, and functional enrichment analysis on differentially methylated positions and regions, further prioritized three CpGs and their annotated genes (cg23800023-ETS1, cg08426368-TGFB3, and cg17350632-HLA-DPB1) for AIx. Among these, ETS1 and TGFB3 have been previously prioritized as candidate genes. Furthermore, both ETS1 and HLA-DPB1 have significant tissue correlations between Whole Blood and Aorta in GTEx, which suggests ETS1 and HLA-DPB1 could be potential biomarkers in understanding pathophysiology of AS/PH. Overall, our findings support the possible role of epigenetic regulation via DNA methylation of specific genes associated with AIx as well as identifying potential targets for regulation of AS/PH.© 2023.

Using DARLIN, we examined fate bias within developing hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and revealed unique features of HSC migration. Additionally, we established a protocol for joint transcriptomic and epigenomic single-cell measurements with DARLIN and found that cellular clonal memory is associated with genome-wide DNA methylation rather than gene expression or chromatin accessibility.

We aimed to explore the relationships between DNAm age and A-ECG heart age and to understand the extent to which DNAm AgeAccel relates to cardiovascular (CV) risk factors in a British birth cohort from 1946.We studied four DNAm ages (AgeHannum, AgeHorvath, PhenoAge, and GrimAge) and their corresponding AgeAccel. Outcomes were the results from two publicly available ECG-based cardiac age scores: the Bayesian A-ECG-based heart age score of Lindow et al. 2022 and the deep neural network (DNN) ECG-based heart age score of Ribeiro et al. 2020. DNAm AgeAccel was also studied relative to results from two logistic regression-based A-ECG disease scores, one for left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction (LVSD), and one for LV electrical remodeling (LVER). Generalized linear models were used to explore the extent to which any associations between biological cardiometabolic risk factors (body mass index, hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, previous cardiovascular disease [CVD], and any CV risk factor) and the ECG-based outcomes are mediated by DNAm AgeAccel. We derived the total effects, average causal mediation effects (ACMEs), average direct effects (ADEs), and the proportion mediated [PM] with their 95% confidence intervals [CIs]. 498 participants (all 60-64 years) were included, with the youngest ECG heart age being 27 and the oldest 90. When exploring the associations between cardiometabolic risk factors and Bayesian A-ECG cardiac age, AgeAccelPheno appears to be a partial mediator, as ACME was 0.23 years [0.01, 0.52] p = 0.028 (i.e., PM≈18%) for diabetes, 0.34 [0.03, 0.74] p = 0.024 (i.e., PM≈15%) for high cholesterol, and 0.34 [0.03, 0.74] p = 0.024 (PM≈15%) for any CV risk factor. Similarly, AgeAccelGrim mediates ≈30% of the relationship between diabetes or high cholesterol and the DNN ECG-based heart age. When exploring the link between cardiometabolic risk factors and the A-ECG-based LVSD and LVER scores, it appears that AgeAccelPheno or AgeAccelGrim mediate 10-40% of these associations.By the age of 60, participants with accelerated DNA methylation appear to have older, weaker, and more electrically impaired hearts. We show that the harmful effects of CV risk factors on cardiac age and health, appear to be partially mediated by DNAm AgeAccelPheno and AgeAccelGrim.

Maternal smoking during pregnancy is a replicated environmental risk factor for this disorder. It is also a robust modifier of gene methylation during the prenatal developmental period. In this study, we sought to identify loci differentially methylated by maternal smoking during pregnancy and relate their methylation levels to various behavioural and physical outcomes relevant to ADHD.We extracted DNA from blood samples from children diagnosed with ADHD and deeply phenotyped. Genome-wide DNA methylation was assessed using Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. Maternal smoking during pregnancy was self-declared and assessed retrospectively.Our sample included 231 children with ADHD. Statistically significant differences in DNA methylation between children exposed or not to maternal smoking during pregnancy were detected in 3457 CpGs. We kept 30 CpGs with at least 5% of methylation difference between the 2 groups for further analysis. Six genes were associated with varied phenotypes of clinical relevance to ADHD. The levels of DNA methylation inRUNX1were positively correlated with the CBCL scores, and DNA methylation inMYO1Gcorrelated positively with the score at the Conners rating scale. Methylation level in a CpG located inGFI1correlated with birthweight, a risk factor for ADHD. Differentially methylated regions were also identified and confirmed the association ofRUNX1methylation levels with the CBCL score.The study has several limitations, including the retrospective recall with self-report of maternal smoking during pregnancy as well as the grouping of individuals of varying age and developmental stage and of both males and females. In addition, the correlation design prevents the building of causation models.This study provides evidence for the association between the level of methylation at specific loci and quantitative dimensions highly relevant for ADHD as well as birth weight, a measure that has already been associated with increased risk for ADHD.

Several studies have linked differential methylation to self-reported intakes of folate and B12, but these estimates can be imprecise, while metabolomic biomarkers can offer an objective assessment of dietary intakes. We explored blood metabolomic biomarkers of folate and vitamins B6 and B12, to carry out epigenome-wide analyses across up to three European cohorts. Associations between self-reported habitual daily B vitamin intakes and 756 metabolites (Metabolon Inc.) were assessed in serum samples from 1064 UK participants from the TwinsUK cohort. The identified B vitamin metabolomic biomarkers were then used in epigenome-wide association tests with fasting blood DNA methylation levels at 430,768 sites from the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip in blood samples from 2182 European participants from the TwinsUK and KORA cohorts. Candidate signals were explored for metabolite associations with gene expression levels in a subset of the TwinsUK sample (n = 297). Metabolomic biomarker epigenetic associations were also compared with epigenetic associations of self-reported habitual B vitamin intakes in samples from 2294 European participants.Eighteen metabolites were associated with B vitamin intakes after correction for multiple testing (Bonferroni-adj. p < 0.05), of which 7 metabolites were available in both cohorts and tested for epigenome-wide association. Three metabolites - pipecolate (metabolomic biomarker of B6 and folate intakes), pyridoxate (marker of B6 and folate) and docosahexaenoate (DHA, marker of B6) - were associated with 10, 3 and 1 differentially methylated positions (DMPs), respectively. The strongest association was observed between DHA and DMP cg03440556 in the SCD gene (effect = 0.093 ± 0.016, p = 4.07E-09). Pyridoxate, a catabolic product of vitamin B6, was inversely associated with CpG methylation near the SLC1A5 gene promoter region (cg02711608 and cg22304262) and with SLC7A11 (cg06690548), but not with corresponding changes in gene expression levels. The self-reported intake of folate and vitamin B6 had consistent but non-significant associations with the epigenetic signals.Metabolomic biomarkers are a valuable approach to investigate the effects of dietary B vitamin intake on the human epigenome.© 2023.

sarah,,No,20231102,dnamage,37873230,Epigenetic age and socioeconomic status contribute to racial disparities in cognitive and functional aging between Black and White older Americans,medRxiv,"Epigenetic age, a biological aging marker measured by DNA methylation, is a potential mechanism by which social factors drive disparities in age-related health. Epigenetic age gap is the residual between epigenetic age measures and chronological age. Previous studies showed associations between epigenetic age gap and age-related outcomes including cognitive capacity and performance on some functional measures, but whether epigenetic age gap contributes to disparities in these outcomes is unknown. We use data from the Health and Retirement Study to examine the role of epigenetic age gap in racial disparities in cognitive and functional outcomes and consider the role of socioeconomic status (SES). Epigenetic age measures are GrimAge or Dunedin Pace of Aging methylation (DPoAm). Cognitive outcomes are cross-sectional score and two-year change in Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS). Functional outcomes are prevalence and incidence of limitations performing Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs). We find, relative to White participants, Black participants have lower scores and greater decline in TICS, higher prevalence and incidence rates of IADL limitations, and higher epigenetic age gap. Age- and gender-adjusted analyses reveal that higher GrimAge and DPoAm gap are both associated with worse cognitive and functional outcomes and mediate 6-11% of racial disparities in cognitive outcomes and 19-39% of disparities in functional outcomes. Adjusting for SES attenuates most DPoAm associations and most mediation effects. These results support that epigenetic age gap contributes to racial disparities in cognition and functioning and may be an important mechanism linking social factors to disparities in health outcomes."
neil,,No,20231102,aging,37884697,Biological age estimation using circulating blood biomarkers,Commun Biol,"Biological age captures physiological deterioration better than chronological age and is amenable to interventions. Blood-based biomarkers have been identified as suitable candidates for biological age estimation. This study aims to improve biological age estimation using machine learning models and a feature-set of 60 circulating biomarkers available from the UK Biobank (n = 306,116). We implement an Elastic-Net derived Cox model with 25 selected biomarkers to predict mortality risk (C-Index = 0.778; 95% CI [0.767-0.788]), which outperforms the well-known blood-biomarker based PhenoAge model (C-Index = 0.750; 95% CI [0.739-0.761]), providing a C-Index lift of 0.028 representing an 11% relative increase in predictive value. Importantly, we then show that using common clinical assay panels, with few biomarkers, alongside imputation and the model derived on the full set of biomarkers, does not substantially degrade predictive accuracy from the theoretical maximum achievable for the available biomarkers. Biological age is estimated as the equivalent age within the same-sex population which corresponds to an individual's mortality risk. Values ranged between 20-years younger and 20-years older than individuals' chronological age, exposing the magnitude of ageing signals contained in blood markers. Thus, we demonstrate a practical and cost-efficient method of estimating an improved measure of Biological Age, available to the general population.© 2023. The Author(s)."
,,No,20231102,methods,37889307,Comprehensive evaluation of the implementation of episignatures for diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs),Hum Genet,"Episignatures are popular tools for the diagnosis of rare neurodevelopmental disorders. They are commonly based on a set of differentially methylated CpGs used in combination with a support vector machine model. DNA methylation (DNAm) data often include missing values due to changes in data generation technology and batch effects. While many normalization methods exist for DNAm data, their impact on episignature performance have never been assessed. In addition, technologies to quantify DNAm evolve quickly and this may lead to poor transposition of existing episignatures generated on deprecated array versions to new ones. Indeed, probe removal between array versions, technologies or during preprocessing leads to missing values. Thus, the effect of missing data on episignature performance must also be carefully evaluated and addressed through imputation or an innovative approach to episignatures design. In this paper, we used data from patients suffering from Kabuki and Sotos syndrome to evaluate the influence of normalization methods, classification models and missing data on the prediction performances of two existing episignatures. We compare how six popular normalization methods for methylarray data affect episignature classification performances in Kabuki and Sotos syndromes and provide best practice suggestions when building new episignatures. In this setting, we show that Illumina, Noob or Funnorm normalization methods achieved higher classification performances on the testing sets compared to Quantile, Raw and Swan normalization methods. We further show that penalized logistic regression and support vector machines perform best in the classification of Kabuki and Sotos syndrome patients. Then, we describe a new paradigm to build episignatures based on the detection of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and evaluate their performance compared to classical differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs)-based episignatures in the presence of missing data. We show that the performance of classical DMC-based episignatures suffers from the presence of missing data more than the DMR-based approach. We present a comprehensive evaluation of how the normalization of DNA methylation data affects episignature performance, using three popular classification models. We further evaluate how missing data affect those models' predictions. Finally, we propose a novel methodology to develop episignatures based on differentially methylated regions identification and show how this method slightly outperforms classical episignatures in the presence of missing data.© 2023.

sarah,,No,20231102,dnamage,37890265,Air pollution and epigenetic aging among Black and White women in the US,Environ Int,"DNA methylation-based measures of biological aging have been associated with air pollution and may link pollutant exposures to aging-related health outcomes. However, evidence is inconsistent and there is little information for Black women.We examined associations of ambient particulate matter <2.5 μm and <10 μm in diameter (PM2.5and PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) with DNA methylation, including epigenetic aging and individual CpG sites, and evaluated whether associations differ between Black and non-Hispanic White (NHW) women.Validated models were used to estimate annual average outdoor residential exposure to PM2.5, PM10, and NO2in a sample of self-identified Black (n=633) and NHW (n=3493) women residing in the contiguous US. We used sampling-weighted generalized linear regression to examine the effects of pollutants on six epigenetic aging measures (primary: DunedinPACE, GrimAgeAccel, and PhenoAgeAccel; secondary: Horvath intrinsic epigenetic age acceleration [EAA], Hannum extrinsic EAA, and skin & blood EAA) and epigenome-wide associations for individual CpG sites. Wald tests of nested models with and without interaction terms were used to examine effect measure modification by race/ethnicity.Black participants had higher median air pollution exposure than NHW participants. GrimAgeAccel was associated with both PM10and NO2among Black participants, (Q4 versus Q1, PM10: β=1.09, 95% CI: 0.16-2.03; NO2: β=1.01, 95% CI 0.08-1.94) but not NHW participants (p-for-heterogeneity: PM10=0.10, NO2=0.20). In Black participants, we also observed a monotonic exposure-response relationship between NO2and DunedinPACE (Q4 versus Q1, NO2: β=0.029, 95% CI: 0.004-0.055; p-for-trend=0.03), which was not observed in NHW participants (p-for-heterogeneity=0.09). In the EWAS, pollutants were significantly associated with differential methylation at 19 CpG sites in Black women and one in NHW women.In a US-wide cohort study, our findings suggest that air pollution is associated with DNA methylation alterations consistent with higher epigenetic aging among Black, but not NHW, women.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.
